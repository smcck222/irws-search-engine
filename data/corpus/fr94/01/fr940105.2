<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order: Grant of authority for subzone status, Dril-Quip,
Inc. (Oil Field Equipment), Houston, Texas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment *&blank;*&blank;*
of foreign-trade zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for
other purposes,'' as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) is authorized
to grant to qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs
ports of entry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Board's regulations (15 CFR part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when
existing zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, an application from the Port of Houston Authority, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 84, for authority to establish
a special-purpose subzone for export activity at the oil field equipment manufacturing facilities of Dril-Quip,
Inc., in Houston, Texas, was filed by the Board on May 10, 1993, and notice inviting public comment was given in the

 (FTZ Docket 17&hyph;93, 58 FR 28952, 03&hyph;18&hyph;93); and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval
of the application for export manufacturing activity is in the public interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 84K) at the Dril-Quip, Inc.,
facilities in Houston, Texas, at the locations described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's
regulations, including &sect;400.28, and subject to a restriction requiring that privileged foreign status (19
CFR 146.41) shall be elected on all foreign merchandise admitted to the subzone.

Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order: Grant of authority for subzone status: Wisconsin

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment *&blank;*&blank;*

Whereas, an application from the Greater Metropolitan Area Foreign Trade Zone Commission, grantee of Foreign-Trade
Zone No. 119, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota, area, for authority to establish a special-purpose subzone for export
activity at the infant formula/dairy products manufacturing plant of Wisconsin Dairies Cooperative in Preston,

Whereas, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval
of the application for export processing is in the public interest; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 119D) at the Wisconsin Dairies
Cooperative plant in Preston, Minnesota, at the location described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and
the Board's regulations, including &sect;400.28, and subject to the further requirement that all foreign-origin

In accordance with &sect;&sect;353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: Pamela Woods, in
room 3069&hyph;A of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with &sect;353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the
Commerce Regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list. The Department
will publish in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Department does not receive, by January 31, 1994, a request for review of entries covered by an order or finding
listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess
antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated
antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse,
for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

We preliminarily determine that sebacic acid from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be,
sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the
Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Since the initiation of this investigation (58 FR 43339, August 16, 1993), the following events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 16, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) a mini-Section A questionnaire (i.e., the section regarding sales volume and value). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 2, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its preliminary determination
that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports
of sebacic acid from the PRC that are allegedly sold at less than fair value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 27, 1993, MOFTEC submitted its mini-Section A response and on September 30, 1993, the Department sent
MOFTEC the antidumping questionnaire. (This antidumping questionnaire is divided into three sections and two attachments:
(1) Section A requests general information on each company; (2) Section C requests information on, and a listing of,
U.S. sales made during the period of the investigation (POI); (3) Section D requests information on the production
process; (4) Attachment I requests information for a market-oriented industry (MOI) claim; and (5) Attachment II
requests information for a separate rates claim.) As a courtesy, we sent a copy of the questionnaire to those companies
identified as possible exporters of sebacic acid to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 30, 1993, we requested that the petitioner, four exporters (``respondents'') who had entered a notice
of appearance before the Department (Sinochem International Chemicals Company (Sinochem International), Sinochem
Jiangsu Import &amp; Export Corporation, Tianjin Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation (Tianjin), and Guangdong
Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation (Guangdong)), and MOFTEC submit any publicly available published information
that they wished the Department to consider when valuing the factors of production in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 22, 1993, the same four exporters who had entered a notice of appearance submitted responses to Section
A of the questionnaire. On October 29, 1993, we sent each company a Section A deficiency questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 1, 1993, the four exporters submitted responses to Sections C and D and Attachments I and II of the questionnaire.
On November 9, 1993, we sent MOFTEC an Attachment I supplemental questionnaire. Also on November 9, 1993, we sent the
four exporters deficiency questionnaires on Sections C and D and Attachment I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 12, 1993, we received Section A deficiency responses from the four exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 16, 1993, the petitioner and the four exporters submitted publicly available published information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 16, 1993, we sent a letter to each of the 13 non-responding PRC exporters to whom we had sent a copy of the questionnaire.
We again requested that they respond to the Department's questionnaire or provide a certification that they did not
export or sell subject merchandise during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on November 16, 1993, we sent supplemental Attachment II questionnaires to MOFTEC and the four responding exporters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 19, 1993, the Department sent to the petitioner and the four exporters a publicly available published
information deficiency questionnaire. On November 23, 1993, the petitioner provided comments on the information
submitted by the four exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 26, 1993, we sent a letter to the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments and the Beijing municipal
government requesting information in order to more completely evaluate the issue of whether the four exporters should
receive separate antidumping duty rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, we received Sections C and D deficiency responses from the four exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From November 29, 1993, through December 3, 1993, we received certifications from three Chinese exporters (Sinochem
China National Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation, Yunnan Minmetals &amp; Chemicals Import &amp; Export
(Group) Corporation, and Shanghai Chemicals Import and Export Corporation) which state that each entity did not
ship sebacic acid to the United States during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1993, the four exporters provided a response to the Department's publicly available published information
deficiency questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 13, 1993, we received a letter from MOFTEC objecting to the November 26, 1993, questionnaires we sent to
the provincial and municipal governments. On December 17, 1993, we received a response to our November 26, 1993, separate
rates clarification questionnaire from the Guangdong Commission of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. On December
20, 1993, we received a response from the Jiangsu provincial government.

Also, on December 20, respondents requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone the final determination an additional 60 days from the date of publication of the affirmative
preliminary determination. See the ``Postponement of Final Determination'' section of this notice. On December
23, 1993, we received a response from the Beijing municipal government but we did not receive a response to our supplemental
Attachment II questionnaire from MOFTEC or from the four responding exporters.

, which include but are not limited to CP Grade (500ppm maximum ash, 25 maximum APHA color), Purified Grade (1000ppm
maximum ash, 50 maximum APHA color), and Nylon Grade (500ppm maximum ash, 70 maximum APHA color). The principal difference
between the grades is the quantity of undesirable ash and color. Sebacic acid contains a minimum of 85 percent dibasic
acids of which the predominant species is the C

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 dibasic acid. Sebacic acid is sold generally as a free-flowing powder/flake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sebacic acid has numerous industrial uses, including the production of nylon 6/10 (a polymer used for paintbrush

All of the respondents in this investigation have claimed that the sebacic acid industry is an MOI. In their November
1, 1993, responses, the respondents claim that all of the manufacturers' material and non-material inputs used to
produce sebacic acid were purchased at market-driven prices during the POI and that none of the factories or the factories'
suppliers produced any of the inputs for sebacic acid for in-plan production. Accordingly, these respondents state
that it is appropriate for the Department to use the PRC prices for material and non-material inputs for valuing the
inputs used to produce sebacic acid.

In the Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the People's Republic of China
(57 FR 9409, 9411; March 18, 1992) (Sulfanilic Acid), the Department set forth the following criteria to be used in
determining whether an MOI exists in an economy which would otherwise be considered non-market: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For merchandise under investigation, there must be virtually no government involvement in setting prices
or amounts to be produced. For example, state-required production of the merchandise, whether for export or domestic
consumption in the non-market economy country would be an almost insuperable barrier to finding a market-oriented
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The industry producing the merchandise under investigation should be characterized by private or collective
ownership. There may be state-owned enterprises in the industry but substantial state ownership would weigh heavily
against finding a market-oriented industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Market-determined prices must be paid for all significant inputs, whether material or non-material, and
for an all but insignificant proportion of all the inputs accounting for the total value of the merchandise under investigation.
For example, an input price will not be considered market-determined if the producers of the merchandise under investigation
pay a state-set price for the input or if the input is supplied to the producers at government direction. Moreover,
if there is any state-required production in the industry producing the input, the share of state-required production
must be insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If these conditions are not met, then, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.52, the producers of the merchandise under investigation
will be treated as non-market economy (NME) producers, and the foreign market value will be calculated by using prices
and costs from a surrogate country, in accordance with sections 773(c)(3) and (4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 9, we issued an MOI deficiency questionnaire to the respondents and sent a supplemental MOI questionnaire
to MOFTEC. This questionnaire contained questions concerning the identity of the entire sebacic acid industry,
the ownership of all entities which produce sebacic acid or supply inputs used to produce sebacic acid, and whether
any inputs were subject to in-plan production. Since we did not receive the responses to our questionnaire on December
23, 1993, we did not have sufficient information on the record for our preliminary determination to determine whether
the sebacic acid industry during the POI was an MOI. Therefore, we will address the respondents' MOI claim in our final
determination.

Separate Rates

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether an NME exporter is eligible for a separate antidumping duty rate, the Department first analyzes
ownership. If an exporter is owned by the central government, the Department will not issue a separate rate for that
exporter. Instead, the Department assigns to all exporters owned by the central government a single, weighted-average
margin.

In the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and
Accessories Thereof from the People's Republic of China (58 FR 37908; July 14, 1993), the Department determined that
NME exporters owned by the central government are not eligible for antidumping duty rates separate from each other
because ownership by the central government enables the government to manipulate prices, whether or not it takes
advantage of its opportunity to do so during the POI. Accordingly, entities owned by the central government cannot
be eligible for rates different or separate from each other. To calculate a rate for exporters owned by the central
government, the Department requires that all potential respondents that are owned by the central government reply
to the antidumping questionnaire. Only complete responses from all the entities owned by the central government
could enable the Department to calculate a weighted-average antidumping margin for the central government-controlled
entities.

In the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's
Republic of China (58 FR 48833; September 20, 1993) (Lock Washers), the Department determined that if an exporter
is not owned by the central government the Department will consider issuing a separate rate. This is because the opportunity
for the central government to manipulate the exporter's prices is less than its opportunity to control the prices
of enterprises owned by the central government. However, as in the case of exporters owned by the central government,
it would still be possible for enterprises under common ownership (e.g., provincial governments, local governments,
collectives, etc.) to have their prices manipulated by the common owner. All firms under common ownership which produce
or sell subject merchandise during the POI must cooperate in the investigation to enable the Department to calculate
a weighted-average dumping margin for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, MOFTEC has informed the Department that the central government does not own any of the responding
exporters of sebacic acid. Furthermore, the responding exporters stated for the record that they do not share ownership
with each other or with any other exporter of sebacic acid. Because non-responding exporters of sebacic acid are located
in the same municipality as Sinochem International and in the same province as Guangdong, we requested separate rates
information from the Beijing municipal government and Guangdong provincial government. We also requested similar
information from the Jiangsu provincial government. Though we have received a response from the Guangdong and Jiangsu
provincial governments, we received a response from the Beijing municipal government too late to consider for the
preliminary determination. After examining the responses submitted by the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments,
we are concerned that the PRC government agencies have not provided information requested by the Department in an
NME investigation. Because the responding companies have stated on the record that they are not owned by the central
government or any other jurisdiction or entity that owns other exporters of sebacic acid, the lack of information
in the two local government responses to our questionnaire should not control our separate rates decision for the
preliminary determination. However, we encourage provincial and municipal government entities to respond, with
the assistance of MOFTEC if appropriate, because this issue will be reconsidered before making the final separate
rates determination in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that each of the four responding exporters states that it is neither owned by the central government nor owned
by another jurisdiction or entity that also owns other exporters of the subject merchandise, we have determined that
these respondents are eligible to be considered for separate rates. The criteria the Department relies upon to establish
whether or not separate rates are appropriate are those put forward in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than
Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588; May 6, 1991) (Sparklers). Under the Sparklers
criteria, the Department issues separate rates where respondents can demonstrate both

a de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 absence of central government control over export activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, each of the four cooperative exporters has documented that its business license provides
that its ownership is distinguished from central-government ownership. In addition, MOFTEC has stated that it does
not own or control the exporters or producers of sebacic acid. This information indicates that there is a de jure absence
of central government control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the four cooperating respondents has asserted and provided evidence such as sales contracts that it establishes
its own export prices and keeps the proceeds of its export sales and that its management operates with complete autonomy.
This information indicates the de facto absence of central government control with respect to exports. Consequently,
we have determined that these four cooperating exporters have met the criteria set forth in Sparklers and we have used
their information to calculate a separate rate for each of them.

Surrogate Country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 773(c) of the Act requires the Department to value the factors of production, to the extent possible, in one
or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy
country, and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that India
and Pakistan are the most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development, based on per capita gross
national product (GNP), the national distribution of labor, and growth rate in per capita GNP. (See memorandum from
the Office of Policy to David L. Binder, dated September 29, 1993.) The Department has also determined that India is
a producer of the subject merchandise. Because India fulfills both requirements outlined in the statute, India is
the preferred surrogate country for purposes of valuing the factors of production used in producing the subject merchandise.
In cases where we were unable to obtain surrogate values from India, we have used values obtained in Pakistan. Specifically,
we have resorted to Pakistan for two surrogate values, where publicly available published values in India were either
significantly outdated or not obtainable. We have obtained and relied upon publicly available published information
wherever possible.

Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of sebacic from the PRC to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and because exporter's sales price methodology
was not otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire, we calculated purchase price based on packed,
CIF prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland
freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, and foreign brokerage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We based the deduction for foreign inland freight on freight rates in India, as the respondents reported the use of
PRC transportation services in incurring this charge. The respondents also reported the use of PRC-based providers
for ocean freight and marine insurance. We based ocean freight on the current tariff rate in the Asia North America
Eastbound Rate Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For foreign brokerage and handling and marine insurance, we used publicly summarized versions of these two expenses
reported in the antidumping duty investigation of sulfur dyes, including sulfur vat dyes, from India (see memorandum
to the file dated December 27, 1993).

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise
for these respondents. The factors used to produce sebacic acid include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate
FMV, the reported factors of production were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs.
(For a complete analysis of the surrogate values used, see our preliminary concurrence memorandum, dated December
27, 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production, we selected, where possible, the
publicly available published value which was: (1) An average non-export value; (2) within the POI; (3) product-specific;
and (4) tax-exclusive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight from the factories to ports. In the case of material
inputs, we also used surrogate transportation rates to value the transportation of inputs to the factories. In those
cases where a respondent failed to provide transportation distances, we applied the longest truck rate from our surrogate
data as best information available (BIA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value castor oil, we used publicly available published information from The Times of India. This source provided
a non-export price during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value caustic soda, sodium chloride, zinc oxide, phenal, and glycerine, we used publicly available published
information from Chemical Business. This source provided a non-export price during the POI which did not appear to
include Indian excise or provincial sales taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value sulfuric acid, cresol, and caproyl alcohol, we used publicly available published information from Chemical
Weekly. This source provided a non-export price during the POI which was inclusive of taxes. However, because we did
not have the necessary information to deduct taxes, we did not remove the taxes from these prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value activated carbon and fatty acid, we used publicly available published information from the Monthly Statistics
of the Foreign Trade of India. In addition, to value macropore resin we used a comparable product's price from Monthly
Statistics of the Foreign Trade of India. This source was the only one we found which provided publicly available published
price information for these material inputs. Because these prices were prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values
to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using wholesale price indices (WPIs) published
in International Financial Statistics (IFS) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value steam coal, we used publicly available published information from the 1993 OECD IEA Statistics. This was
the most current publicly available published information we found that provided a price for steam coal. Because
the price quoted was prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period
in question and the POI using WPIs published in IFS by the IMF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value electricity, we used publicly available published information from the Monthly Statistical Bulletin published
by the Pakistani Federal Bureau of Statistics. This source provided an electricity rate for industrial use in the
POI. We found that the published information for Indian electricity rates was either outdated or appeared to be non-specific.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To value water, we used a cable from the U.S. consulate in Pakistan. We used this cable because we could not locate a value
for water in any Indian or Pakistani publication. Because the price contained in the cable was for a period prior to
the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using
WPIs published in IFS by the IMF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value labor costs, we used the International Labor Office's 1992 Yearbook of Labor Statistics. To determine the
number of hours in an Indian workday, we used the Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990. Because the published
labor rate was prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question
and the POI using the consumer price index published in IFS by the IMF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value factory overhead, selling, general and administrative expenses, and profit, we calculated percentages
based on elements of industry group income statements from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin. We did not include an
amount for energy in our factory overhead calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate FMV for one ton of sebacic acid, we added each of the costs derived above. We also added to FMV, where appropriate,
an amount for packing labor based on the appropriate Indian wage rate, and an amount for packing materials based on
Indian prices from the Monthly Statistics of the Foreign Trade of India. We made no adjustments for selling expenses.
Finally, we added surrogate freight costs for the delivery of inputs and packing materials to the factories producing
sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, respondents stated that the factories produce three valuable by-products (glycerine, fatty
acid, and caproyl alcohol) in the course of producing sebacic acid. Respondents maintain that the Department should
deduct the value of these three by-products from the cost of manufacture. We disagree with the respondents that the
products are all by-products, and that the value of each should be deducted from the cost of manufacture of sebacic
acid. Rather, as discussed below, we agree that fatty acid is a by-product but determine that glycerine and caproyl
alcohol should not be considered by-products in this case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three products in question are all yielded during the production of sebacic acid and the products are an unavoidable
consequence of the production of sebacic acid. These products are produced from the same raw materials, by the same
equipment, during the same manufacturing operations, as those used for sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by-products are treated differently from other types
of products (i.e. joint or co-products) for purposes of determining a product's costs. The distinction between by-products
and these other products is based on relative sales value. By-products are identified by their relatively insignificant
sales value, whereas these other products, regardless how they are referred to, generally have significant sales
value relative to the product under investigation. In this case, we determined whether the value of a product was significant
or insignificant based on the quantity yielded and the value assigned to each product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the relative values of all subsidiary products and the subject merchandise, we took into account the
fact that: (1) The factories generally sell the subsidiary products in the domestic market; (2) the factories sell
sebacic acid in the domestic market; (3) the PRC renminbi is a non-convertible currency; and (4) the factories' costs
and profits have not been considered because we have not yet addressed respondents' MOI claim. In accordance with
the hierarchy for preferred input values as set forth in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain
Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 21058 (May 18, 1992) (Comment 4) and
the publicly available published information selection methodology noted above, we used surrogate values from
India for sebacic acid, glycerine, caproyl alcohol, and fatty acid to determine the relative value of each product
based on the production of one metric ton of sebacic acid, as well as to determine the total value of one metric ton of
sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we determine that fatty acid is a by-product because the overall value of fatty acid is insignificant
compared to the relative value among all of the ``subsidiary'' products and the subject merchandise. As a by-product,
we subtracted the sales revenue of fatty acid from the production costs of the other products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we determine that glycerine and caproyl alcohol are not by-products.
The value of glycerine for two of the four factories and the value of caproyl alcohol for all four factories is significant
compared to the relative value of all of the products manufactured as a result of or during, the process of manufacturing
sebacic acid. The reason why we find that glycerine should not be considered as a by-product is because we conclude
that the quantity of production of this product appears subject to manipulation by management based on the variation
in the quantity yield among the four factories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we allocated the factor inputs, e.g., materials, used to produce glycerine and caproyl alcohol, by the
relative quantity of output of these two products and sebacic acid. We did not allocate the amount of labor, energy
usage or factory overhead among the products because we did not have the information to allow us to make accurate adjustments

The Department's policy, as set forth in Lock Washers, is that all potential exporters owned by a given entity must
cooperate in our investigation in order for the response to be considered complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MOFTEC did not submit a consolidated questionnaire response on behalf of all PRC exporters of sebacic acid. As noted
above, the list of PRC exporters of sebacic acid submitted by MOFTEC contained the names of firms which have not responded
to the Department's antidumping questionnaire. Since the Department must receive an adequate questionnaire response
from each entity to which a separate dumping rate can be applied, all non-responding entities must receive a PRC country-wide
rate. In the absence of adequate questionnaire responses from the other exporters of sebacic acid, we have based PRC
country-wide rate on BIA. Section 776(c) of the Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information
requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department
shall use BIA. We have done so in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of respondents'
cooperation. According to the Department's two-tiered BIA methodology, when a company refuses to provide the information
requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate
for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the
highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. This methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (

that they have been uncooperative in this investigation. As BIA for these exporters, we are assigning the highest
margin provided in the petition (243.40) as the PRC country-wide rate, in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology
under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate or otherwise
significantly impede the proceeding. No adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations.

No ``All Others'' rate will be established for the PRC. Instead, a country-wide rate is applied to all imports of sebacic
acid from the PRC for those PRC exporters which were unable to demonstrate that they were entitled to a separate rate.
Because we are assigning a country-wide rate in this situation, there is no need to assign an ``All Others'' case deposit

Hainan Feitian Electrontech Co., Ltd. (Hainan), Shaanxi Minmetals (Shaanxi), Xiamen Abrasive Co. (Xiamen), 7th
Grinding Wheel Factory Import and Export Corp., Qinghai Metals and Minerals Import &amp; Export Corp., and The Import
and Export Corporation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, responding exporters in this proceeding, account for
a significant proportion of exports of merchandise covered by this investigation. On December 1 and 3, 1993, these
exporters requested that the Department of Commerce (the ``Department'') postpone its final determination until
not later than 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our November 29, 1993, preliminary determination (58 FR 64549, December 8, 1993) in this proceeding was affirmative.
In accordance with section 735(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) and 19 CFR 353.20(b), when, subsequent
to an affirmative preliminary determination, we receive a request for postponement of the final determination from
exporters who account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation, we are required, absent
compelling reasons for denial, to grant the request. Accordingly, we are postponing our final determination as to
whether sales of silicon carbide from the PRC have been made at less than fair value until not later than April 22, 1994.

Amended Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 2, 1993, we disclosed our calculations for the preliminary determination to counsel for Hainan, Shaanxi,
and Xiamen. On December 7, 1993, we received timely submissions from each of these three exporters alleging ministerial
errors in the Department's preliminary determination calculations. (For specific details of these allegations
and our analysis of them, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford of December 20, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of these exporters, Hainan, alleged that the Department made certain errors with respect to the valuation of freight
rates and packing materials. We agree, and in accordance with procedures set forth in the proposed regulations, we
are amending Hainan's preliminary dumping margin because the corrections represent a change of more than five absolute
percentage points and more than 25 percent of the dumping margin calculated in the original (erroneous) preliminary
determination. See &sect;353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations, 57 FR 1131 (January 10, 1992).
The corrected dumping margin for Hainan is 50.42 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rest of the alleged ministerial errors were either not ministerial in nature or could not be considered a ``significant
ministerial error.'' See &sect;353.15(g)(4) of the Department's proposed regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given to the States of Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South
Dakota, and Wisconsin, their political subdivisions and combinations thereof, and to private or public nonprofit
organizations and associations that, pursuant to Title III of Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;75, sections 202 (a)(5) and (c)
of the International Travel Act of 1961, as amended, and 42 U.S.C. 3151, a total of $3 million is available from the USTTA
to the States affected by the major, widespread flooding of 1993, to assist projects to promote tourism within the
United States and from the contiguous Canadian market. As used in this notice, ``private or public non-profit organization
or association'' means an institution, organization, or association, either private or public, which has tax exempt
status as defined in section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These funds are intended to defray the costs of increased tourism promotion needs resulting from the flooding. An
applicant may receive no more than one award for this disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only eligible applicants from the nine eligible States whose applications receive a final evaluation score of 80
or greater will be considered for an award. No applicant will be awarded funds unless the application includes a project
or projects from at least two of the six project areas set forth in section IV.C., below. No applicant will be awarded
funds unless the application includes: (1) Documentation demonstrating that all programs set forth in the application
are or will be effectively coordinated with other affected entities in the State; and (2) a marketing plan that contains
clearly stated objectives for a time period of one year and procedures for credible evaluation and tracking, and that
is integrated (in terms of multiple activities) with a generally cohesive approach. Further, no applicant will be
awarded funds unless the projects for which funding is sought are aimed at market(s) which have potential for mitigating
the tourism-related negative effects of the disaster. The application must include credible market research to
support this potential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum amount an applicant from the States of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, whose tourism industries have been
most severely affected by the floods, shall be awarded is $400,000 and cannot exceed an aggregate of $400,000 annually
for such projects for each State. Applicants from the States of Nebraska, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Kansas and Wisconsin shall be eligible to receive up to $300,000 and cannot exceed an aggregate of $300,000 annually
for such projects for each State. The minimum amount for which an applicant may apply is $200,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on individual State funding limitations, applicants will be awarded assistance in descending order starting
with the applicant whose proposal has the highest final evaluation score. Subject to the availability of funds, grants
will be awarded on a state-by-state basis according to final evaluation scores, State funding limitations, and broad
geographic distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The funding instrument will be a grant unless it is anticipated that the USTTA will be substantially involved in the
implementation of the project for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument will be a cooperative
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that all funds have not been obligated after the first competition, a second competition will be announced.
Applicants from the eligible States that have not reached their maximum limitation, as noted above, will be invited
to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support the tourism promotional effort financed by this program, a comprehensive national public relations campaign
will be developed to encourage recovery of visitation to the affected region. Components of the campaign may include,
but are not limited to, public service announcements (broadcast or print), development of a ``1&hyph;800'' number
for tourist information, and endorsements by celebrity spokespersons. Applicants are encouraged to utilize the
umbrella campaign in their overall effort.

I. Selection Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be reviewed and judged individually, independent from all other applications, by each of four
qualified evaluators acting without consultation among themselves. Each evaluator will score each application
by awarding points for each of the three (3) evaluation criteria set forth in IV, below. Scores awarded for each evaluation
criterion will be multiplied by the weight assigned to that criterion. A maximum score of 100 points may be awarded
to an application. Once scores have been determined individually by each evaluator, a final score for each application
will be determined by averaging the scores provided by each of the four evaluators.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient is required to provide 25 per cent matching funds for the total project cost.

In determining the amount of the non-Federal share, due consideration will be given to all contributions both in cash
and in-kind. In-kind contributions shall be made in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (non- or for-profits)
or 15 CFR part 24 (state and local governments). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A waiver of the match may be requested if the non-Federal share is not reasonably available and the applicant provides
documentation clearly demonstrating the lack of resources due to the disaster.

Take notice that on December 20, 1993, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;149&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas
Act for permission and approval to abandon a 652 horsepower compressor unit and appurtenant facilities in Nueces
County, Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL proposes to abandon by sale the compressor, which is located at the interconnection between TGPL's Petronilla
Lateral and the pipeline system of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) in Nueces County. It is
stated that the compressor was installed under Commission authorization in Docket No. CP80&hyph;533&hyph;000
by order issued March 23, 1981. It is asserted that the compressor was installed to alleviate capacity constraints
on TGPL's Petronilla Lateral so that TGPL could take delivery of up to 30,000 Mcf of gas per day which was imported from
Mexico at an existing delivery point with Texas Eastern. It is explained that TGPL was purchasing gas from Border Gas,
Inc. for system supply purposes, but that TGPL has not purchased gas under the gas purchase contract since December
1984 and does not plan to resume such purchases. It is stated that the proposed abandonment would have no impact on the
daily design capacity or operating conditions on TGPL's system. It is further stated that no customers would lose
service as a result of the proposed abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January
7, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for TGPL to appear or be
represented at the hearing.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
California-based corporations and officers, who purported to hairbows, from making any material misrepresentations
regarding earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about
the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement would require the respondents
to pay $1.9 million to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

any material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial statements and related documents, that determination
shall cause the entire amount of monetary liability of one million nine hundred thousand dollars ($1,900,000) to
become immediately due and payable to the Federal Trade Commission, and interest computed at the rate prescribed
in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance. Proceedings initiated

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
The Hairbow Company, Inc., Rainbow Productions, Inc., and Russell J. Osborne (``proposed respondents''). All of
the proposed respondents are located in Danville, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hairbow Company and Rainbow Productions disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items
at home. The Hairbow Company sells instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to
individuals wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by The Hairbow Company's home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to The Hairbow
Company for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented that there
is a significant marketplace demand for the demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges
that these misrepresentations violate Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondent to notify the Commission of changes in corporate
structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance his present business or employment
and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondent to file compliance reports with the
Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,900,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines
that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
California-based corporations and an officer, who purported to market pillows and Christmas ornaments, from making
any material misrepresentations regarding earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity and from
making misrepresentations about the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement
would require the respondents to pay $1.04 million to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
Homespun Products, Inc., G &amp; S Marketing, Inc., and Gregory A. Straw (``proposed respondents''). All of the Proposed
respondents are located in Suisun, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homespun Products and G &amp; S Marketing disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items at
home. Homespun Products sells instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to individuals
wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by Homespun Products' home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to Homespun Products
for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented that there is a significant
marketplace demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges that these misrepresentations
violate Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondents to notify the Commission of changes in corporate
structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance of his present business or employment
and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondents to file compliance reports with the
Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,040,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines
that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

In settlement of alleged violations of Federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
New Mexico-based corporation and its officer, who claimed to sell beaded earrings, from making any material misrepresentations
regarding earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about
the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement would require the respondents
to pay $1.2 million to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
New Mexico Custom Designs, Inc. and Anthony L. Ingram (``proposed respondents''). Both of the proposed respondents
are located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Mexico Custom Designs, Inc. and Anthony L. Ingram disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft
items at home. They sell instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charge registration fees, to individuals
wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by New Mexico Custom Designs' home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to New Mexico
Custom Designs for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented
that there is a significant marketplace demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges that
these misrepresentations violate section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondent to notify the Commission of changes cn Corporate
structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance of his present business or employment
and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondents to file compliance reports with the
Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above other
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,200,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines
that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Agreement Containing Consent Order To Cease and Desist
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of the Personal Protective
Armor Association, Inc., and it now appearing that Personal Protective Armor Association, Inc., hereinafter sometimes
referred to as proposed respondent, is willing to enter into an agreement containing an Order to cease and desist from
engaging in the acts and practices being investigated,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby agreed by and between the proposed respondent and its attorney and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission
that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed respondent Personal Protective Armor Association, Inc. (``PPAA'') is a corporation organized, existing
and transacting business under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Tennessee, with its office and principal place
of business located at 3623 Falls Road, Baltimore, Maryland 21222.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. PPAA admits all of the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of Complaint here attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. PPAA waives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any further procedural steps;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered into pursuant
to this agreement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft of Complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its Complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of Complaint here attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, the Commission
may, without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) Issue its Complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of Complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to cease and desist in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the Order to cease and desist
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the same
time as provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal
Service of the Complaint and decision containing the agreed-to-order to proposed respondent's address as stated
in this agreement shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of
service. The Complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation,
or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed respondent has read the proposed draft of Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. It understands that
once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully complied
with the Order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Personal Protective Armor
Association (``PPAA''), which is located in Baltimore, Maryland. The agreement would settle charges by the Commission
that the proposed respondent violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by engaging in practices that
restricted competition among PPAA members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Complaint
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complaint prepared for issuance by the Commission along with the proposed order alleges that PPAA and its members
have engaged in acts and practices that have unreasonably restrained competition among manufacturers of soft body
armor. The complaint alleges that PPAA members have maintained a policy against comparative advertising and have
adopted a policy not to compete in offering products liability insurance to law enforcement agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the complaint, advertising, including comparative advertising and advertising of warranties and
products liability insurance, enables firms to inform consumers as to the quality, price, and terms of sale of the
product. Consumers consider terms of sale such as products liability insurance and certification that the soft body
armor passes applicable performance standards. Comparative advertising and advertising of warranties and products
liability insurance enables firms to inform consumers about these factors and increases the information available
to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint states that, during some periods, from 1986 to the present, PPAA has maintained a policy against comparative
advertising, including a policy which declares it unethical for any member to make any representation that another
member's vests have failed certification testing. The complaint also states that, during some periods, from 1986
to the present, PPAA adopted a policy to respond uniformly to bids by not offering products liability insurance in
competing for contracts from law enforcement agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that the purposes or effects of the challenged act or practice have been to restrain competition
unreasonably:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. By frustrating and restraining competition in the marketing and sale of soft body armor on the basis of price, service,
and quality;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. By depriving consumers of the benefits of truthful information about the performance of soft body armor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. By depriving consumers of the potential value of warranties, including products liability insurance, in the purchase
of soft body armor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Consent Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part I of the order covers definitions. These definitions make clear that the consent order applies to directors,
trustees, councils, committees, officers, representatives, delegates, agents, employees, successors, or assigns
of PPAA. The order also defines ``soft body armor'' as concealable bullet-resistant vests generally worn by civilians
and law enforcement personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the order describes the conduct prohibited by the order. Part II prevents PPAA from entering into or carrying
out any agreement between or among its members that restricts engaging in comparative advertising or restricts offering
or providing products liability insurance. Part II also prevents PPAA from restricting or interfering with the advertising
or dissemination of prices, terms, availability, characteristics, or conditions of sale of soft body armor by adopting
a policy which restricts or prohibits a member from engaging in comparative advertising or offering or providing
products liability insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III of the order requires PPAA to furnish a copy of the Commission's order to each of its members; to provide each
new member who joins PPAA with a copy of the Order and complaint; and to file compliance reports for five years.

Concurring Statement of Commissioner Roscoe B. Starek, III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I concur in the Commission's decision to accept for public comment the Consent Order in this matter. The evidence demonstrates
that ten companies, representing more than 90% of U.S. sales of protective body armor, engaged in unreasonable restraints
of trade in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45. The agreements here restrain significant
dimensions of competitive rivalry among body armor manufacturers. Therefore, they appear likely, absent an efficiency
justification, to restrict output. The respondent has not proffered any efficiency justification for the restraints.
Under the standards set forth in the Commission's decision in Massachusetts Board of Registration in Optometry,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and its progeny, this ``inherently suspect'' conduct is appropriately condemned without a full rule of reason analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In my view, however, it may have been appropriate to name as respondents the members of the Personal Protective Armor
Association (``PPAA''). This case is not typical of the Commission's cases challenging anticompetitive conduct
of state licensing boards and trade associations. In most such cases, the board or association represents hundreds
or thousands of competing entities.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Naming individual members as respondents in such cases is generally impracticable: It may unnecessarily complicate
litigation or create intractable problems for settlement negotiations.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 More importantly, naming members is often unnecessary: The respondent board or association is typically the only
(or only effective) means by which the multitude of competitors can reach and enforce an agreement restraining competition.

By contrast, competitors in the relatively concentrated protective body armor industry may be able to collude effectively
outside the auspices of the PPAA or any other formal trade association.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 If so, the proposed Consent Order, which names only the PPAA as a respondent, may provide an insufficient remedy. So
long as the PPAA is not involved,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 the same body armor manufacturers could engage in collusive conduct falling squarely within the core cease and desist
provisions of the Order without exposure to civil penalties under section 5(l) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(l).

Thus, unlike many cases involving association restraints in which the respondent association itself is a critical

involvement may be merely detail.

Under the Order, respondent PPAA is defined to include any association that can be held to be a legal successor. The
evidence does not clearly indicate whether or not PPAA has any structural, legal, or historical advantage that would
impede the creation of a new, non-successor body armor trade association.

Of course, this conduct would expose these firms to private and state actions for damages under section 4 of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 15. Such exposure, however, apparently did not deter the conduct that led to the Commission's action
in this matter.

this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
Oregon-based respondents, who marketed potholders and mohair for use as doll's hair, from making any material misrepresentations
regarding earnings or profits or participants in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about
the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement would require the respondents
to pay $536,000 to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. All claims under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed
respondents, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondents that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint, or that the facts alleged in the draft complaint, other
than the jurisdictional facts, are true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may,
without further notice to proposed respondents, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside in the same manner and within the same time
provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service
of the complaint an decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondents' address as stated in this agreement
shall constitute service. Proposed respondents waive any right they may have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed respondents have read the proposed complaint and order contemplated hereby. They understand that once
the order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that they have fully
complied with the order. Proposed respondents further understand that they may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

It is further ordered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. That respondents shall jointly and severally pay to the FTC as consumer redress the sum of five hundred and thirty-six
thousand dollars ($536,000); provided however, that this liability will be suspended, subject to the provisions
of subparts B and D below, upon the payment of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) no later than fifteen (15) days
after the date of service of this Order. Such payment shall be made by cashier's check or certified check payable to
the Federal Trade Commission and shall be delivered to the Federal Trade Commission, San Francisco Regional Office,
901 Market Street, suite 570, San Francisco, CA 94103.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. That, in the event of respondents' default on the $25,000 payment set forth in subpart A above, the amount of five
hundred and thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000), less the sum of any payments made pursuant to subpart A above,
shall become immediately due and payable without any notice required to be given to the respondents, and interest
computed at the rate prescribed under 28 U.S.C. 1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. That any funds paid by respondents pursuant to subparts A and B above shall be paid into a redress fund administered
by the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used to provide direct redress to those purchasers of respondents' introductory
kits (as described in the complaint) who have not previously been reimbursed by respondents for the cost of the kit
through a refund or through the purchase of finished product. If the Federal Trade Commission determines, in its sole
discretion, that the redress to purchasers (as defined above) is wholly or partially impracticable, any funds not
so used shall be paid to the United States Treasury. Respondents shall be notified as to how the funds are disbursed,
but shall have no right to contest the manner of distribution chosen by the Commission. No portion of the payment as
herein described shall be deemed a payment of any fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. That the Commission's acceptance of this Order is expressly premised upon the financial statements and related
documents previously provided by respondents to the FTC, signed and dated July 27, 1992. After service upon respondents
of an order to show cause, the FTC may reopen this proceeding to make a determination whether there are any material
misrepresentations or omissions in said financial statements and related documents. Respondents shall be given
an opportunity to present evidence on this issue. If, upon consideration of respondents' evidence and other information
before it, the FTC determines that there are any material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial statements
and related documents, that determination shall cause the entire amount of monetary liability of five hundred and
thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000), less the sum of any payments made under subpart A above, to become immediately
due and payable to the Federal Trade Commission, and interest computed at the rate prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 1961, as
amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance. Proceedings initiated under Part III are in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other civil or criminal remedies as may be provided by law, including any proceedings the
Federal Trade Commission may initiate to enforce this Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
William E. Taylor and Susan L. Taylor, who do business under the name Sandcastle Creations (``proposed respondents'').
The proposed respondents are located in Newport, Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sandcastle Creations disseminates advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items at home. It sells instructional
kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to individuals wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by Sandcastle Creations' home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to Sandcastle
Creations for Compensation. The complaint alleges that this misrepresentation violates section 5(a)(1) of the
Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the individual proposed respondents to notify the Commission of their
discontinuance of their present business or employment and each new business or employment affiliation, and requires
the proposed respondents to file compliance reports with the Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject
to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $536,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, and the payment to the Federal Trade Commission of $25,000, with the proviso that the Commission
can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines that there are material misrepresentations or omissions
in the financial disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 3B4363) has been filed by PPG Industries, Inc., 440 College Park Dr., Monroeville, PA 15146.
The petition proposes to amend the food additive regulations in 1A176.200 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Defoaming agents used in coatings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.200) and 1A176.210 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Defoaming agents used in the manufacture of paper and paperboard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.210) to provide for the safe use of alpha-(dinonylphenyl)-omega-hydroxy-poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)
containing 7 to 24 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of dinonylphenol, as a defoaming agent used in the production of
paper and paperboard coatings and paper and paperboard intended to contact food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act, (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before February
4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the final regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the interest rate to be used by Federal agencies in the formulation and evaluation of plans
for water and related land resources is 8 percent for fiscal year 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rate has been computed in accordance with section 80(a), Public Law 93&hyph;251 (88 Stat. 34) and 18 CFR 704.39,
which: (1) Specify that the rate shall be based upon the average yield during the preceding fiscal year on interest-bearing
marketable securities of the United States which, at the time the computation is made, have terms of 15 years or more
remaining to maturity (average yield is rounded to nearest one-eighth percent); and (2) provide that the rate shall
not be raised or lowered more than one-quarter of 1 percent for any year. The Treasury Department calculated the specified
average yield to be 7.08 percent. However, application of the above mentioned limitation to the fiscal year 1993 rate
of 8.25 percent limits the change in the fiscal year 1994 rate to 8 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of 8 percent shall be used by all Federal agencies in the formulation and evaluation of water and related land
resources plans for the purpose of discounting future benefits and computing costs, or otherwise converting benefits
and costs to a common time basis.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 10, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Pencil Makers Association,
Inc., Marlton, NJ, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material
injury by reason of LTFV imports of certain cased pencils from the People's Republic of China and Thailand. Accordingly,
effective November 10, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;669&hyph;670
(Preliminary).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60670). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on December 1, 1993, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on December
27, 1993. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2713 (December 1993), entitled ``Certain
Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China and Thailand: Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;669&hyph;670

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 31, 1993, the Commission instituted an investigation into allegations by complainants Tanabe Seiyaku Co.,
Ltd. and Marion Merrell Dow (``complainants'') that respondents Gyma Laboratories of America, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., Mylan Laboratories, Inc. and Profarmaco Norbel SRL (``Mylan respondents'') ; Orion Corporation Fermion,
Interchem Corporation, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., and Copley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (``the Fermion Respondents'');
and Abic Ltd. (``Abic'') were violating section 337 in the importation and sale of certain diltiazem hydrochloride
and diltiazem preparations allegedly manufactured abroad by a process covered by claim 1 of U.S. Letters Patent 4,438,035
(``the 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;035 patent''). Plantex USA (``Plantex'') was later added as a respondent. On May 3, 1993, respondent Abic
requested that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (``PTO'') reexamine all claims of the 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;035 patent. On June 25, 1993, the PTO granted Abic's request and began reexamination proceedings. On November
22, 1993, the PTO issued an office action rejecting claims of the 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;035 patent as obvious under 35 U.S.C. 103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 23, 1993, as a result of the PTO's rejection, complainants moved to suspend the Commission investigation
pending the outcome of the PTO reexamination proceedings. Respondents opposed the motion, and the Commission investigative
attorney (IA) supported the motion. On November 24, 1993, the presiding ALJ issued an ID suspending the investigation
until 30 days after the completion of reexamination proceedings at the PTO or until such time as may be prescribed by
the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 2, 1993, Abic and Plantex filed a petition for review of the ID. On December 6, 1993, the Fermion respondents
filed a response in support of Abic and Plantex's petition for review. On December 9, 1993, complainants and the IA
filed oppositions to respondents' petition for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) and &sect;210.53(h)
of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are available
for inspection during official business hours (8:45 to 5:15 p.m. in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International
Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired
persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on

Boston and Maine Corporation (BM), and Springfield Terminal Railway Company (ST) filed a notice of exemption under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BM and ST have certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic
has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or
local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending
with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year
period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR
1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The persons listed in the information section of this notice have claims pending against the Islamic Republic of Iran
which are before the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC) for adjudication. The claims are among a total of
approximately 3,100 claims of under $250,000 which were settled under an agreement between the United States and
Iran which took effect on June 22, 1990. However, these claimants have failed to inform the FCSC of their current addresses,
and despite its efforts, the FCSC has been unable to locate or contact these claimants. The purpose of this notice is
to publicize the names, claim numbers, and last known addresses of these claimants, and to inform them that unless
they furnish their current addresses to the FCSC by March 1, 1994, their claims will be dismissed from further consideration.

PPG Industries, Inc., Ford City, Pennsylvania; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By an application dated December 13, 1993, the Aluminum Brick and Glass Workers Union requested administrative reconsideration
of the Department's denial of trade adjustment assistance (TAA) benefits for workers of the subject firm. The Department's
notice of negative determination was issued on November 29, 1993 and will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 soon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The union claims that a French Canadian firm is selling glass at prices lower than domestic producers' costs. The union
also states that the Department's survey of customers did not take into account the lowered demand for glass in the
industry and PPG plans for expansion in Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. The Department's survey of PPG's major customers shows that most respondents
did not import and those that did had very minor import purchases in the period relevant to the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation file shows that the workers at Ford City purchase glass and fabricate it into commercial windows
unlike the French Canadian firm cited by the union which is a primary glass producer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the union's example of sheet glass and fabricated commercial glass windows, the Department does not
see any relevance. One is a raw material used in making a different product while the other is a finished article. Sheet
glass and fabricated commercial glass windows are not interchangeable, nor are they like or directly competitive
within the meaning of section 222(3) of the Trade Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, company officials indicated that there is a downswing in the production of commercial glass windows because
the commercial market currently is overbuilt. The construction boom during the 1980s resulted in record vacancy
rates for office buildings, stores and hotels_all users of fabricated glass windows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings show that the PPG does not import commercial glass windows.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 19, 1993, after being granted a filing extension, one of the former workers requested administrative
reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for
Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued
on September 27, 1993 and was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54736).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former worker submitted additional information showing that the Midland facility had decreased sales and production
in 1993.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

3. Following its acquisition, the Art Work has been in the possession of Dr. Jacobson at his residence located at 630
N. Sierra Drive, Beverly Hills, California. During a 1993 audit, the Service determined that Dr. Jacobson had engaged
in prohibited transactions with the Plans by reason of his use of the Art Work for the years 1989 and 1990.

The Department notes that in 1987 the Profit Sharing Plan purchased a third party note for cash form the Norman L. Jacobson,
M.D., P.A. Profit Sharing plan, the sole participant and trustee of which is Dr. Jacobson's brother, Norman L. Jacobson.
In 1993, the Profit Sharing Plan sold the note back to the Norman L. Jacobson, M.D., P.A. Profit Sharing Plan for cash.
The Department is not granting an exemption for such purchase and sale and is expressing no opinion as to whether the
purchase and sale of such note constitutes a violation of any provision of the Code.

Dr. Jacobson represents that he will file Forms 5330 with the Service and pay the applicable excise taxes associated
the past prohibited transactions within ninety days of the publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the notice granting this proposed exemption. In addition, Dr. Jacobson will pay the Plans the fair market rental
value in the amount of approximately $90,000 for his use of the Art Work for years 1989 through 1993. Excise taxes will
accrue for the period between 1989 and 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. At present, the Art Work has produced no income for the Plans. In order to enable the Plans to divest themselves of
the Art Work and to invest in income-producing, marketable securities, Dr. Jacobson proposes to purchase the Art
Work from the Plans for a cash amount equal to the aggregate of the greater of either: (a) The original amount paid by
the Plan at the time of acquisition; or (b) its fair market value on the date of the Sale. Accordingly, Dr. Jacobson requests
an administrative exemption from the Department to permit his purchase of the Art Work from the Plans under the terms
and conditions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Art Work has been valued by two separate, independent, qualified appraisers, Arline Edelbaum and Jacqueline
Silverman, both the Los Angeles, California. Ms. Edelbaum is a senior member of the American Society of Appraisers
and has nineteen years experience in appraising fine arts and personal property. Ms. Silverman is a certified member
of Appraisers Association of America and has fifteen years experience in appraising modern and contemporary art.
Both appraisers represent that they are unrelated to and independent of Dr. Jacobson. Ms. Edelbaum and Ms. Silverman's
valuations of the Art Work as of June 28, 1993 and June 22, 1993, respectively, are as follows:

Because their fair market values are less than or equal to their original purchase price, ``Untitled'' and ``Fouffi
Noutti in Hell'' will be purchased by Dr. Jacobson for their original purchase prices of $135,000 and $220,000, respectively.
In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Jacobson will purchase ``Grau for $165,000, which reflects its higher fair market valuation as determined by
Ms. Edelbaum. Finally, Dr. Jacobson will purchase ``Pau'' for $275,000, which reflects its fair market value as determined
by both appraisers. Dr. Jacobson proposes to purchase the Art Work for an aggregate cash purchase price of $795,000.

6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transactions will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: (a) The Sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (b) the Plan will not
be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with this transaction; (c) the Art Work will
be appraised by a qualified, independent appraiser; (d) the sale price for the Art Work will reflect the greater of
either: (1) The original amount paid by the Plan at the time of acquisition; or (2) its fair market value on the date of
the Sale; and (e) within ninety days of the publication in the

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) They are protective of the rights of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application
of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the transfer
of shares of common stock (the Stock) of Cummins Engine Company, Inc. (Cummins) to the GEBT by Tenneco, Inc. (Tenneco),
the Plan sponsor, to reflect the contribution of the Stock to the Plan, provided that: (a) The Stock is valued at its
fair market value as of the date of contribution by a qualified, independent appraiser; (b) the contribution of the
Stock is approved on behalf of the Plan by a qualified, independent fiduciary; (c) the GEBT's continued holding of
the Stock is monitored by a qualified, independent fiduciary; (d) the GEBT's independent fiduciary will monitor
and enforce the conditions of the exemption and take whatever action is necessary to protect the GEBT's rights, including,
but not limited to, the enforcement of a legally enforceable contribution obligation (the Contribution Obligation)
as described in the Notice of Proposed Exemption, which will remain in force for as long as the GEBT continues to hold
any shares of the Stock; and (e) the Contribution Obligation is secured by a letter of credit issued by a bank approved
by the GEBT's independent, qualified fiduciary.

In the Notice of Proposed Exemption, the Department invited interested persons to submit written comments and requests
for a hearing on the exemption. All comments and requests for hearing were due by December 20, 1993. The Department
received over 100 telephone inquiries from interested persons who expressed concern over the effect, if any, of the
transaction on their pension benefits. These inquiries were responded to by a Department representative who informed
the callers that the transaction does not affect the calculation of pension benefits or the Plan's obligation to make
benefit payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received a total of 29 written comments with only one of those comments containing a request for a hearing.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Nine commentators stated that they did not understand the proposed exemption or how it would affect their pensions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the exemption provides relief from section 406(b) of the Act, 29 CFR 2570.46 of the Department's regulations
provides that the Department in its discretion may convene a hearing if requested by interested persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remaining commentators were opposed to the granting of the exemption. The comments addressed 17 general areas
of concern about the proposed transaction. The concerns are summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Questions about the correct value of Cummins Stock, including a question about the discrepancy between the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) price quoted in the Notice and the price quoted in a national newspaper on December 2, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Concerns that the restrictions on the Stock make the Stock less valuable and increase the risk that the Plan will
not be able to dispose of the Stock in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concerns about the wisdom of investing this much of the GEBT's assets in one company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Assertions that Tenneco would not be able to stand behind its obligation under the Contribution Obligation based
on its history of financial troubles.

10. Questions regarding the wisdom of allowing Tenneco to contribute Cummins stock to the GEBT since, according to
the commentator, Tenneco owns Cummins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Comments indicating that the Plan participants would prefer to receive cash contributions rather than stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Allegations that individuals who would be affected by the proposed transaction have not received proper notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Questions concerning the independent fiduciary's alleged determination that the Stock will experience no precipitous
declines in value in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Confusion over the consequences for the GEBT of any decline in value of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Concern over the proper exercise of the voting and other privileges applicable to shareholders of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Questions about the guidelines for determining if and when to adjust the amount of the letter of credit (or alternative
collateral) which secures the Contribution Obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. A request that Tenneco guarantee that the value of the contribution will not be diminished by transaction costs
when the Stock is sold at some future date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses to these comments were submitted by the applicant, on behalf of both Tenneco and Woodbridge, the GEBT'S
independent fiduciary. These responses are summarized as follows, corresponding in order to the comments listed
above: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. According to the applicant, subsequent to the publication of the Notice of Proposed Exemption, Cummins had a 2 for
1 stock split which accounts for the change in the price of the Stock as listed on the NYSE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The applicant notes that after a review of the Stock's past performance, Woodbridge has determined that the Stock
is a prudent investment for the Plan despite the restrictions on transferability. Furthermore, the applicant states
that the Stock's value has been determined by an independent appraisal company, taking the restrictions into account.
Finally, the applicant notes that the restrictions on transfer of the Stock will expire in July, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The applicant explains that once the Stock is contributed to the GEBT, it will represent only 5.65% of the assets
of the GEBT. In addition, because each of the Affected Plans has an undivided interest in the assets of the GEBT, no single
plan will hold all of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The applicant asserts that Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's rating of Tenneco debt as investment grade, as well
as Tenneco's recent sale of $1 billion of equity, are indications that Tenneco is a viable company. The applicant again
notes that the proposed transaction is backed by the judgment of Woodbridge as independent fiduciary, by the independent
appraisal of the Stock and by the letter of credit in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The applicant represents that due to Tenneco's financial condition, as described in 4. above, a letter of credit
in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock is sufficient to protect the interests of the GEBT. The applicant represents
that the face value of the letter of credit is approximately $32,000,000. The applicant also represents that Tenneco's
financial condition is good and that its credit-worthiness is adequate security for the unsecured portion of the
Contribution Obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. According to the applicant, the contribution of the Stock to the GEBT is part of an overall strategy to ensure that
the Tenneco Plans will be fully funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The applicant represents that the Contribution Obligation assumed by Tenneco guarantees the value of the contribution
since Tenneco is required to make a cash contribution to the GEBT to compensate for any loss in the value of the Stock
in any calendar quarter. Furthermore, the Contribution Obligation is secured by a letter of credit issued by a major
bank in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The applicant responds by explaining that all plans invested in the GEBT are defined benefit plans, the benefits
of which are not affected by the investment performance of plan assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Retiree medical benefits are not relevant to the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Tenneco does not own Cummins. The applicant represents that Tenneco owns less than 10% of Cummins' stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The applicant represents that the contribution of the Stock to the GEBT is essentially the same as a cash contribution
to the GEBT followed by a purchase of Cummins' stock by the GEBT. In addition, the applicant states that maintaining
the Plan assets primarily in uninvested cash would be a breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA. The applicant further
states that the GEBT will at all times maintain sufficient liquid assets to pay benefits when due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant also represents that the Stock is not replacing cash or other assets in the GEBT; rather, the Stock is
being contributed in addition to the assets already held in the GEBT. According to the applicant, the contribution
of Stock enables Tenneco to accelerate the time at which the GEBT will receive contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The applicant represents that it has complied with all applicable notice requirements. An authorized representative
of Tenneco has provided the Department with a declaration under penalty of perjury attesting to the truth of the information
regarding Tenneco's notice to interested persons as required by the Department's regulations (see 29 CFR 2570.43).
In addition, in response to information indicating that several interested persons in and around Hutchinson, Kansas
had not received proper notice of the proposed exemption, the applicant represents that notice was again provided
to people in the Hutchinson area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The applicant explains that, contrary to the commentator's assertion, Woodbridge has not made any such determination
but has concluded that the Stock is a prudent investment for the GEBT, based in part on the Stock's market history over
the past 3 years. In addition, Woodbridge has determined that any decline in value of the Stock would be adequately
compensated for by the Contribution Obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The applicant asserts that the Contribution Obligation ensures that the value of the stock contribution will
remain the same even if the value of the Stock decreases. The applicant explains that, if, for example, the Stock is
valued at $160,000,000 on the date of contribution to the Plan and, over the course of a year the price drops, Tenneco
would be obligated, over the course of that year, on a quarterly basis, to contribute cash so that the value of the Stock
plus the aggregate amounts of cash contributed pursuant to the Contribution Obligation equals $160,000,000. It
is represented, therefore, that the value of the intial contribution will never be diminished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The applicant responds by explaining that Woodbridge, acting in its capacity as independent fiduciary, will
exercise the stock voting rights and the right to designate a person to the Cummins Board of Directors, pursuant to
the direction of the GEBT's Investment Committee; provided, that Woodbridge may decline to designate the Investment
Committee's choice if it determines that to do so is in the GEBT's best interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The applicant states that the determination regarding the increase in the amount of the letter of credit or the
need to provide alternative collateral is a simple calculation based on the difference between (a) the balance of
the letter of credit and (b) the product of the number of shares of the Stock held by the GEBT, the contribution price
of the Stock and 20%.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17. The applicant explains that the Contribution Obligation will be in effect when the Stock is sold in the future.
According to the applicant, if the Stock is sold at a loss, any transaction costs would be accounted for by the Contribution
Obligation which would require Tenneco to contribute an amount equal to the number of shares sold, multiplied by the
difference between the realized net price and the Lowest Price (see paragraph 5 in the Notice of Proposed Exemption).
If the Stock is sold at a gain, the GEBT would bear the transaction costs. The applicant represents that it is customary
for pension plans to bear such transaction costs in similar circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one of the interested persons who commented on the proposed exemption requested a public hearing, although several
others indicated that they wished to be notified if a hearing was scheduled. The Department has considered the concerns
expressed by the commentators and the applicant's written responses addressing such concerns, and, on the basis
of the materials provided, has determined not to hold a public hearing. Furthermore, after giving full consideration
to the entire record, including the written comments and the responses thereto, the Department has decided to grant
the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the applicant has informed the Department that it intends to enter into the transaction on December 29, 1993,
and requests that the exemption be made effective as of that date. The Department concurs with this suggested modification.

exemption refer to the Notice of Proposed Exemption published on November 15, 1993, at 58 FR 60217.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

North Atlantic Energy Service Corp. et al., Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of
No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an order authorizing a transfer
of ownership and an amendment to the Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;86 issued to North Atlantic Energy Service
Corporation (North Atlantic/the licensee) for operation of the Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, located in Rockingham
County, New Hampshire.

Identification of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would approve the transfer of ownership of Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative,
Inc's. (Vermont) 0.41259 percent share of Seabrook 1 to North Atlantic Energy Company (NAEC). A license amendment
would be issued to change the footnote on page 1 of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;86 by deleting Vermont,
as one of the entities for which North Atlantic is authorized to act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, Vermont filed a claim against Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) with the United States Bankruptcy
Court which was then hearing a petition from PSNH for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code. Vermont's claim sought redress for damages which were alleged to have been incurred while PSNH had been the managing
agent for Seabrook 1. In November 1990, the two parties arrived at a settlement which included an agreement by PSNH
or its designee to purchase Vermont's share of Seabrook 1 subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from all regulatory
agencies. Subsequently, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the stipulation that PSNH and Vermont had
filed describing the settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992, in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization for PSNH that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Northeast
Utilities (NU) acquired PSNH in merger transactions and, after receipt of NRC approval, NAEC (a newly-formed and
wholly-owned subsidiary of NU) acquired PSNH's interest in the Seabrook 1. As the successor to PSNH's interest in
Seabrook 1, NAEC is obligated to purchase Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station. The transfer of Vermont's ownership
share in Seabrook 1 to NAEC will consummate the settlement entered into by Vermont and PSNH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would approve the transfer of ownership of 0.41259 percent of Seabrook 1 from Vermont to NAEC.
The transfer will not involve any changes to the Seabrook 1 staff, to the facility itself, or in the manner by which Seabrook
1 is operated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has evaluated the environmental impact of the proposed action and has determined that the probability
or consequences of accidents would not be increased by the transfer of ownership, and that post-accident radiological
releases would not be greater than previously determined. Further, the Commission has determined that the transfer
of ownership would not affect routine radiological plant effluents and would not increase occupational radiological
exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the transfer of ownership would not affect nonradiological plant
effluents and would have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant, any
alternative with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested approval. Denial of the application would result in no change
in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are
identical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
Related to Operation of Seabrook Station, Units 1 and 2, dated December 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the State of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts regarding the environmental
impact of the proposed action. The State of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had no comments on
the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for approval dated August 27, 1993, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW; Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Exeter Public Library, 47 Front Street, Exeter, New Hampshire

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
Licensing Nos. DPR&hyph;80 and DPR&hyph;82, issued to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for operation
of Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in San Luis Obispo, California.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would consist of revisions to the Technical Specifications in response to the revised 10 CFR
part 20. The change would revise the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in
gaseous effluents, and reflect the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These
changes are in response to the licensee's application for amendments dated July 7, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision, in regard to the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS) as
a dose rate to the maximally exposed member of the public, will not increase the types or amounts of effluents that may
be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the Commission
concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant envirommental impacts associated with the proposed
amendments to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or will have greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments.
This would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
and Addendum related to the operation of Diablo Canyon Power Plant Units 1 and 2, dated May 1973 and May 1976, respectively.

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 7, 1993, which is available

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Northeast Nuclear Energy
Company, et al. (the licensee) to withdraw its December 2, 1988 application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating
License DPR&hyph;21 for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, located at the licensee's site in New London
County, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would have revised the Technical Specifications to reflect the implementation of modifications
during the 1989 refueling outage related to degraded grid undervoltage detection. Since the licensee plans to make
additional modifications to the undervoltage detection circuitry during the Cycle 15 refueling outage, additional
Technical Specification changes will be necessary and will be submitted prior to the outage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5170). However, by letter dated September 10, 1993, the licensee withdrew the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated December 2, 1988, and the
licensee's later dated September 10, 1993, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents
are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resources Center, Three Rivers

Notice described the circumstances surrounding the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the
Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee responded to the Notice in a letter dated November 17, 1993. In its letter, the Licensee admitted the violations
which resulted in the proposed civil penalty, but requested that the NRC reconsider the circumstances surrounding
the violations and mitigate the proposed civil penalty for reasons that are summarized in the Appendix to this order.

On October 18, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for violations
identified during an NRC inspection on July 14&hyph;16, 1993. Physicians' Laboratory Service, Inc. responded to
the Notice on November 17, 1993. The Licensee admitted the violations that resulted in the proposed civil penalty,
but requested that the NRC reconsider the circumstances surrounding the violations and mitigate the proposed civil
penalty. A restatement of the violation, and the NRC's evaluation and conclusions regarding the Licensee's request
follow:

10 CFR 35.32 (a) and (e), require, in part, that by January 27, 1992, each licensee establish and maintain a written
quality management program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material
will be administered as directed by the authorized user. The quality management program must include written policies
and procedures to meet specific objectives, including that prior to administration, a written directive is prepared
for any administration of quantities greater than 30 microcuries of sodium iodide I&hyph;125 or I&hyph;131. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 35.2, ``Definitions,'' defines a written directive, in part, as an order in writing for a specific patient,
dated and signed by an authorized user prior to administration of a radiopharmaceutical and specifies, in part, that
for the administration of quantities greater than 30 microcuries of either sodium iodide I&hyph;125 or I&hyph;131
or any therapeutic administration of a radiopharmaceutical other than sodium iodide I&hyph;125 or I&hyph;131,
the written directive must include the dosage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Contrary to the above, between January 27, 1992, and July 27, 1992, the licensee did not establish a written quality
management program (01013). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contrary to the above, on numerous occasions after January 27, 1992, including March 8 and 22, May 13, June 3, and
July 1, 1993, the licensee administered sodium iodide I&hyph;131 for diagnostic purposes in quantities greater
than 30 microcuries without a written directive signed by an authorized user (01023).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the violation involving the failure to establish a written Quality Management Program, the Licensee
admitted that it did not establish a Quality Management Program by the January 27, 1992 effective date of the rule.
The Licensee states that it first learned of the requirement to establish a Quality Management Program following
receipt of the June 1992 NMSS Newsletter and that it immediately devised a plan and submitted it to the NRC by July 27,
1992. Because corrective action was taken without NRC intervention, the Licensee requested that the violation be
dismissed or mitigated to a reprimand without penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the violation concerning the administration of sodium iodide without a written directive signed by
an authorized user, the Licensee admitted that a ``minimal number'' of patients received dosages of greater than
30 microcuries without written directives having been prepared. The Licensee stated that it took immediate corrective
action and requested that the violation and the civil penalty be mitigated. In addition, the Licensee requested that
the NRC take into account the fact that during the past 23 years, approximately 20,000 to 23,000 diagnostic administrations
had occurred with no known misadministrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request for Mitigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The violations were not considered separately in this case. The proposed penalty was based on the aggregate of the
two violations (i.e., a Severity Level III problem). Thus, the severity level of the violations was based on their
collective significance_that is the combination of not establishing a Quality Management Program until six months
after the effective date of the rule and not implementing the requirements of the Quality Management Program even
after a written program was established by the Licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC places a great deal of importance on its Quality Management regulation. Thus, its Enforcement Policy was revised
at the same time the rule was adopted to place an emphasis on noncompliance with the rule. Example C.6 was added to Supplement
VI, such that violations involving ``A substantial failure to implement the quality management program as required
by &sect;35.32 *&blank;*&blank;*'' was to be classified at Severity Level III (Note: This was later amended to state
``Substantial failure to implement the quality management program as required by &sect;35.32 that does not result
in a misadministration *&blank;*&blank;*'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``substantial'' has consistently been applied to failures of a programmatic, as opposed to an isolated,
nature. In this case, the Licensee's failure was deemed programmatic because the Licensee repeatedly failed to use
written directives for diagnostic administrations of sodium iodide I&hyph;131 on quantities that exceeded 30 microcuries
because of weaknesses in the program. Thus, the violations were appropriately classified in the aggregate as a Severity
Level III problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the magnitude of the proposed civil penalty, the Licensee's argument are related to the civil penalty
adjustment factors of Identification, Corrective Action and Licensee Performance. The use of these factors is described
in Section VI.B.2 of the Enforcement Policy. No adjustment was made to the proposed base penalty with respect to any
of these factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Licensee identified its failure to establish a Quality Management Program and corrected it by submitting
a plan to the NRC, the plan it submitted lacked specificity, contributing in part to the second violation, the failure
to use written directives for diagnostic administrations of I&hyph;131 in excess of 30 microcuries. The second violation
was identified by the NRC, continued for nearly a year after the Licensee became aware of the regulation, and was occurring
at the time of the license transfer. The Licensee's arguments do not provide a basis for mitigation under the identification
factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No adjustment was made under the corrective action factor because these violations were discovered after the license
had been transferred to another entity. Thus, this factor did not, and still does not, appear to be applicable to the
circumstances of this case. In addition, although the Licensee corrected its failure to establish a Quality Management
Program, its corrective action was weak, i.e., the Licensee did not implement the use of written directives for diagnostic
procedures, as discussed above. Thus, the Licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation under the corrective action
factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No adjustment was made under the licensee performance factor. The Licensee's performance was considered relatively
poor in the two inspections that preceded the July 14&hyph;16, 1993 inspection. Several Severity Level IV and V violations
were issued following each of the two prior inspections, one occurring in September 1991 and the other occurring in
March 1990. This was balanced, however, against the fact that the July 1993 inspection found only the violations related
to the Quality Management rule. Thus, notwithstanding the Licensee's statements about an absence of misadministration,
the Licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation under the prior performance factor.

NRC Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensee has not provided any information that provides a basis for reclassifying the violations or mitigating
the proposed civil penalty. The proposed civil penalty in the amount of $2,500 should be imposed by order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By application dated February 28, 1980, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) submitted a request for
renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;71 for the UCLA Research Reactor Facility (UCLA facility). By letters dated
June 14 and July 26, 1984, UCLA requested termination of Facility License No. 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
R&hyph;71. A ``Notice of Proposed Issuance of Orders Authorizing Disposition of Component Parts of Terminating
Facility License'' was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on September 24, 1984 (49 FR 37484). Following hearings and stipulations on the license renewal and termination applications
by the parties involved, an order was issued on November 8, 1985, by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that approved
a Settlement Agreement dated September 30, 1985, between the Regents of the University of California, the Campus
Committee to Bridge the Gap, and the staff of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission/NRC).
The Order also terminated UCLA License No. R&hyph;71. The Settlement Agreement stipulated a timetable for the decommissioning
of the UCLA facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By application dated October 29, 1985, as supplemented, UCLA submitted a Phase I decomissioning plan. An order authorizing
Phase I dismantling of the UCLA facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commission on July 14,
1986. Phase I concerned the removal of all UCLA facility components except for the concrete building structure, concrete
biological shield, components affixed to or embedded in the biological shield, the holdup tank, primary water pump,
sump pump, compressor system, floor drains, decontamination sinks, and fuel storage pits. Phase I of decommissioning
was completed on August 18, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By application dated June 10, 1988, as supplemented, UCLA submitted its Phase II decommissioning plan. An order authorizing
Phase II dismantling of the UCLA facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commission on July 28,
1989. Phase II decommissioning concerned the removal of components that remained after completion of Phase I decommissioning.
When Phase II decommissioning was completed, UCLA submitted final survey information on January 4 and 28 and February
22, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reactor fuel has been removed from the core and shipped to a Department of Energy (DOE) facility. The UCLA reactor
facility has been completely dismantled and all NRC and settlement agreement requirements pertaining to residual
radioactivity, personnel and external radiation exposure, and fuel disposition have been met. Confirmatory radiological
surveys verified that the UCLA facility met the recommended regulatory guidance for release of the facility for unrestricted
use. Accordingly, the Commission has found that the UCLA facility has been dismantled and decontaminated pursuant
to the Commission Orders dated July 14, 1986, and July 28, 1989, and the Settlement Agreement. Satisfactory disposition
has been made of the component parts and fuel in accordance with the Commission regulations in title 10 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) chapter I, and in a manner not inimical to the common defense and security, or to the health
and safety of the public. Therefore, on the basis of the Settlement Agreement, applications filed by UCLA and pursuant
to sections 104 and 161 b, i, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the UCLA facility is released for unrestricted
use as of the date of this Order. In accordance with 10 CFR part 51, the Commission has determined that the issuance of
this Order will have no significant environmental impact. The Environmental Assessment was published in the

Yale-New Haven Hospital (Licensee), New Haven, Connecticut, is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 06&hyph;00819&hyph;03
(License), issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission). The License was most recently amended
on September 15, 1993. The License authorizes the Licensee to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with
radioactive material as well as research in accordance with the conditions specified therein. This is a broad scope
license. The License was most recently renewed on August 13, 1985, and was due to expire on August 31, 1990 but was extended
by the NRC pending staff action on the Licensee's renewal request. Based on the Licensee's application to renew the
License dated June 17, 1990, and pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37(b), the existing License has not expired and continues in
effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Between December 3, 1992, and January 27, 1993, the NRC performed two inspections of licensed activities at the Licensee's
facility. The inspections were conducted to review two incidents involving therapeutic misadministrations and
a failure to control licensed material that occurred between November 30 and December 1, 1992, and on January 21, 1993.
During the inspections, five violations of NRC requirements were identified. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed
Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated April 26, 1993. The Notice states
the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount
of the civil penalties proposed for the violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee responded to the Notice on June 10, 1993. In its response, the Licensee denies Violations II.A and II.B
set forth in the Notice; questions the Severity Level classification for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C; and requests
reduction of the civil penalties.

On April 26, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was issued for violations
identified during two NRC inspections. The Licensee responded to the Notice on June 10, 1993. The Licensee denied
Violations II.A and II.B; questioned the Severity Level classification of Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C; and requested
reduction of the civil penalties. The NRC's evaluations and conclusions regarding the Licensee's requests are as

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
I.A. Condition 23 of License No. 06&hyph;00819&hyph;03 requires that licensed material be possessed and used in
accordance with statements, representations, and procedures contained in an application dated December 13, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Item 7 of that application, dated December 13, 1984, states that the Hospital Radioisotope Committee has the responsibility
of establishing and enforcing the Hospital's Radiation Safety Program to ensure the safety and welfare of hospital
personnel and property as well as protecting the surrounding community from the potential hazards of sources of ionizing
radiation used at the hospital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A procedure of the Hospital's Radiation Safety Program entitled, ``Procedure for Nursing Care of Patients Containing
Radioactive Sources for Therapy'', requires, in part, that ``during nursing care procedures, the nurse must check
all materials used by the patient .&blank;.&blank;. for radioactive sources that may have become dislodged,'' and
that ``everything used by the patient (except dishes) must be saved and monitored before disposal.''

Contrary to the above, the Hospital Radioisotope Committee did not enforce the Hospital's Radiation Safety Program
to ensure safety and welfare of hospital personnel and property as well as protecting the surrounding community from
the potential hazards of all sources of ionizing radiation used at the hospital. Specifically, on November 30 and
December 1, 1992, nurses on the ninth floor of Yale-New Haven Hospital removed linen pads from a brachytherapy patient's
room without first checking the pads for radioactive sources which may have become dislodged and failed to survey
the linen pads before disposal.

B. 10 CFR 20.207(a) requires that licensed materials stored in an unrestricted area be secured against unauthorized
removal from the place of storage. 10 CFR 20.207(b) requires that licensed materials in an unrestricted area and not
in storage be tended under constant surveillance and immediate control of the licensee. As defined in 10 CFR 20.3(a)(17),
an unrestricted area is any area access to which is not controlled by the licensee for purposes of protection of individuals
from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, on December 1 and 2, 1992, licensed material consisting of a 35 millicurie cesium-137 brachytherapy
source was located, at various times, in unrestricted areas, namely, a hallway on the ninth floor of the hospital,
the laundry collection area of the hospital, and a contractor's laundry facility; and at those times, the brachytherapy
source was not under the constant surveillance and immediate control of the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. 10 CFR 20.105(b) requires, in part, that except as authorized by the Commission in 10 CFR 20.105(a), no licensee
allow the creation of radiation levels in unrestricted areas which, if an individual were continuously present in
the area, could result in his receiving a dose in excess of 2 millirems in any one hour or 100 millirems in any seven consecutive
days.

Summary of Licensee Response to the Violations in Section I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Licensee, in its response, states that the safety significance of the loss of the source was minimal, noting that
the potential absorbed dose to any member of the general public as a result of this incident was well below regulatory
limits. Further, the Licensee argues that the possibility of public exposure was minimized by the hospital's prompt
search for and discovery of the source. The Licensee believes that personnel and members of the public who may have
been exposed to the source received only a minimal dose as a result of this incident, noting that its calculations indicate
that the maximum dose to any exposed individual was unlikely to have exceeded a total of 30 millirems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Licensee recognizes that, under postulated worst case conditions, the exposure rate at distances less
than 2.4 meters could have exceeded the NRC's applicable limits for the general public, the Licensee argues that this
exposure condition would only have existed for very short periods of time, on the order of several minutes, and with
the bulk of the postulated exposure at a dose rate well below NRC's standards for the general public. The Licensee also
notes that the source was located in linen that was removed from a patient's room, and that since the linen is treated
as a biologically hazardous waste, it is highly unlikely that a person would have any extended contact with the source
once it had left the patient's room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee states that immediately upon discovery that a source was missing, the Radiation Safety Officer, and
the resident physician who misplaced the source, conducted a search that promptly located and safely recovered the
missing source. The Licensee further contends that despite this corrective action, the NRC chose to treat the sequential
consequences which flowed from the initial failure as separate violations which could be treated in the aggregate
and escalated to a Severity Level III problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, while the Licensee recognizes the NRC's authority to cite for each separate violation, the Licensee
believes that the circumstances of the violations do not represent a programmatic breakdown in its radiation safety
program, and even when aggregated, do not have the safety or regulatory significance to be considered a Severity Level
III problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee argues that the 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty was not warranted since the Notice makes reference
to an incident that occurred in 1989. The NRC's enforcement policy states that a licensee's prior performance normally
refers to a period within the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections;
whichever is longer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Licensee concludes by requesting that the NRC exercise its discretion to reduce the civil penalty associated
with the violations in Section I of the Notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
While the NRC agrees that the doses to members of the general public resulting from the loss of the source were small,
the source was, nonetheless, missing for a period of time in excess of twenty-three hours. During that time, the source
was in the hallway outside the patient's room for at least seventeen hours, in a basement laundry closet and in a laundry
service truck for at least an hour each, and on the floor of the laundry facility or in the laundry washing machine for
at least four and one half hours. None of these locations was controlled by the Licensee for the purposes of radiation
protection. Therefore, since the radiation levels were in excess of applicable levels for unrestricted areas for
periods of hours, this created a significant potential for an exposure in excess of regulatory limits to personnel
or members of the public, and the NRC maintains that this is a significant lack of control of licensed material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in Section C.1 of Supplement VI of the Enforcement Policy, violations involving a failure to control access
to licensed materials for radiation purposes (as specified in the NRC requirements) constitute Severity Level III
violations. Therefore, Violation I.B could have been individually classified at Severity Level III. However, the
NRC chose to aggregate the Licensee's violation in failing to control licensed material with its root cause (failure
to survey_Violation I.A) as well as the effect of the violation (the creation of radiation levels in excess of that
allowed in NRC regulations_Violation I.C) since the three violations were all related to the one incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the above, the assertion that Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C were classified in the aggregate at Severity Level
III because they represent a programmatic breakdown is incorrect. In addition, the Licensee's contention regarding
corrective action, involving the prompt location and recovery of the source are not controlling in determining the
severity level of the violation. The severity level is determined by the safety or regulatory significance of the
violation. The Licensee's request for mitigation of the civil penalty is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the violations were properly classified in the aggregate as a Severity Level III problem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
II.A. 10 CFR 35.32(a) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management
program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered
as directed by the authorized user. Pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4), the quality management program must include written
policies and procedures to meet the objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, as of November 30, 1992, the licensee's quality management program did not include written
policies and procedures to meet the objective that each administration was in accordance with the written directive.
In particular, the licensee did not establish written procedures to identify if a brachytherapy source was not properly
implanted or inadequately secured against accidental removal. As a result, on November 30, 1992, during a therapy
procedure that involved a gynecological implant of four cesium-137 sources, one source was either not implanted
as required or it was implanted properly but inadequately secured because the source came out of the applicator and
lay undetected in the patient's bed. As a result, the dose administered to the patient was less than that prescribed
by the physician and the patient received a radiation dose to the leg, an area not intended to receive radiation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management
program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered
as directed by the authorized user. The quality management program must include written policies and procedures
to meet the specific objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 27, 1992, the licensee implemented a quality management program for the use of byproduct material. Section
3 of the quality management program entitled ``Policies and Procedures for Brachytherapy'', paragraph 3.1.3 of
the ``High Dose Rate Remote Afterloading Devices'', requires, in part, that the treatment site be confirmed with
the written directive and treatment plan by the administering person before administration of the treatment dose.

In its response, the Licensee denies that it violated the requirement to establish and maintain a written QMP, noting
that it established a written QMP based upon the NRC's own guidance published in Regulatory Guide 8.33 on January 27,
1992, and as required by 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4). The Licensee further states that the written quality management policy
and procedures were distributed to all authorized users for comment on January 21, 1992, and no comments were received
from the authorized users on this final version, and the same version was presented to NRC Region I in a letter dated
January 27, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee also notes that in addition to giving each authorized user a copy of the written quality management policy
and procedures, the radiation safety officer conducted formal training for the members of the radiation therapy
staff on March 5, 1992, detailing the requirements of the QMP, and both physicians involved in the alleged violations
attended this presentation. The Licensee further states that both physicians understood that the written directive
needed to be verified during the application process. Nonetheless, despite the existence of a comprehensive QMP
and related training, these events occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the first incident, the Licensee also states that the resident physician followed the established
procedures and, therefore, reasonably concluded that he had successfully placed the sources in the applicator during
the loading process, and he and the dosimetrist identified the correct sources as they were moved from the transportation
shield. The Licensee stated that in the process of moving one of the four sources and its applicator to the patient,
the source inadvertently slipped unnoticed from the applicator, and that since the resident missed the source in
its fall under the patient, he had no opportunity to identify the error once the applicator was placed into the Fletcher
Suit Device (FSD). Since the resident wholly believed he had fulfilled the written directive, the Licensee submits
that he had satisfied the requirements of the QMP regardless of his error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the second incident involving the High Dose Rate Afterloading (HDR) device, the Licensee states that
the physician who prepared the written directive was the same physician who placed the applicator in error. Since
he was the prescribing physician, the Licensee contends that there is no doubt that he understood the intent of the
written directive. The Licensee states that while the physician did not visually confirm or verify the placement,
he fully believed that he had correctly placed the applicator, based on his sense of touch during the physical examination,
knowledge of anatomy, the feel and depth of the applicator insertion, and by asking the patient if she felt comfortable
after the placement. Since the physician fully believed that he had carried out the written directive, the Licensee
submits that it had fulfilled the requirements of the QMP notwithstanding his error.

The NRC does not dispute, in general, that the Licensee established and maintained a QMP, or that it provided training
to authorized users. However, with respect to the first incident, the NRC maintains that the Licensee's QMP did not
include written policies and procedures to provide high confidence that the QMP would meet the objective that each
brachytherapy administration is in accordance with the written directive. 10 CFR 35.32(a) requires, in part, that
each licensee shall establish and maintain these written policies and procedures to provide high confidence that
the radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. Therefore, it is incumbent
upon the Licensee to establish written procedures that provide high confidence in the delivery process of therapeutic
radiation and the accurate administration of the prescribed dose. In this case, the Licensee did not establish adequate
written procedures, as required, to effectively implement their QMP and procedures to verify whether brachytherapy
sources were properly inserted in accordance with the written directive. In particular, the QMP was inadequate in
that it did not require visual or other verification of proper insertion of the sources while they were being inserted.
The Licensee stated that it established a QMP based on requirements in 10 CFR 35.32. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires that
each administration be in accordance with the written directive. The licensee's QMP did require that a means be employed
of verifying sources are positioned properly. However, the licensee had not established such a procedure to meet
this objective by directing the physician to verify proper insertion of the source or sources (e.g., by visual inspection).
In this instance, visual verification of the sources in the applicator would have been an acceptable means. The QMP
did not have any procedure to ensure, nor did the physician confirm, that the administration of the dose was in accordance
with the written directive. Therefore, the QMP did not provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material
would be administered as directed pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the second incident, although the authorized user fully understood the intent of the written directive,
the individual did not confirm or verify the proper placement of the applicator, which had not been placed into the
correct organ, with the treatment site specified in the written directive and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 treatment plan. The Licensee stated that it established a QMP based on requirements in 10 CFR 35.32. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4)
requires that each administration be in accordance with the written directive but did not describe how this should
be done. The licensee's QMP did require the treatment site be confirmed with the written directive. Visual verification
of the source insertion into the proper organ would have been an acceptable means. As in violation IIA, the QMP appears
inadequate in that it did not require visual or another specific procedure for verification of proper insertion of
the sources while they were being inserted. The QMP did not have any specific procedure to ensure, nor did the physician
confirm, that the administration of the dose was in accordance with the written directive. Therefore, the QMP did
not provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material would be administered as directed pursuant to
10 CFR 35.32(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC realizes that confirmation of a treatment site by the Licensee may be accomplished in a number of ways. However,
it is the responsibility of the Licensee to establish effective procedures to meet the performance-based objective
of the QMP required by 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4), and provide high confidence that the intended therapeutic radiation is
administered to the designated treatment site as prescribed by the physician authorized user. In this case, simple
visual confirmation could have prevented the error and would have provided higher confidence than the physician's
method of feeling to locate the treatment site.

As demonstrated by the authorized user's failure to treat the prescribed treatment site, the Licensee did not meet
the objective in 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC agrees that the Licensee had a QMP and that the physician understood the intent of the written directive. The
NRC has determined, however, that the procedures may have been inadequate in that the physician did not adequately
confirm (or verify) the placement of the applicator and that the QMP procedure for confirmation (or verification)
is vague and does not provide high confidence that the objective will be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the NRC maintains that with regard to both incidents, violations of the QMP occurred.

Summary of Licensee Response Requesting Mitigation of the Civil Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general comment to violations identified in Sections I and II of the Notice, the Licensee contends that the civil
penalties should be reduced, noting that it has voluntarily conducted an independent, formal, and comprehensive
review of the hospital's radiation safety program, and a panel of four experts conducted the review on May 10 and 11,
1993. The Licensee also notes, as evidenced by this formal review program, and other comprehensive measures detailed
in its incident reports dated December 22, 1992, January 4, 1993, and February 5, 1993, that it is committing significant
management and fiscal resources to address the concerns expressed in the enforcement action. The Licensee believes
that the remedial actions that the NRC seeks to encourage will be realized without the need for stringent enforcement
in the form of proposed civil penalties, and that this is consistent with the Enforcement Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the violations in Section I, as stated above, the Licensee notes that the NRC letter stated that 100
percent escalation of the civil penalty was warranted based upon the hospital's past enforcement history. Since
the letter makes reference to an incident which occurred in 1989, the Licensee questions consideration of that action
since the NRC's Enforcement Policy indicates that a licensee's prior performance normally refers to a period within
the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer. Since
this license is a broad scope license that is inspected on a yearly interval, the Licensee believes it is contrary to
established NRC practice to cite an incident occurring more than three and a half years ago as a basis for escalation
of the civil penalty. Further, since the NRC's current Enforcement Policy has been modified to provide for maximum
flexibility and consideration of all mitigating circumstances, the Licensee requests that the NRC exercise its
discretion to reduce the civil penalty associated with the violations in Section I of the NOV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the violations in Section II, the Licensee states that the NRC's cover letter to the NOV indicates that
all of the adjustment factors set forth in 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, were considered. Although the NRC increased the
base civil penalty by 200 percent for ``past enforcement history and multiple examples,'' and concluded that the
remaining factors warranted no further adjustment, the Licensee believes that, upon closer examination of the circumstances,
mitigation is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``multiple examples'' adjustment factor, the Licensee notes that the NRC's Enforcement Policy makes
it explicitly clear that for this factor to be applicable, the multiple occurrences should have the ``same root causes.''
The Licensee contends that while the NRC indicated that the root cause of the two incidents was inattention to detail
by the treating physicians, this is not the root cause of the cited violations. The Licensee notes that the NOV states
that the root cause of Violation II.A was failure to have an adequate procedure in place consistent with the program
requirements in 10 CFR 35.32, whereas the second violation, II.B, is stated by the NRC to arise from a different root
cause, namely, failure to follow an existing procedure established in conformance with the program requirements
of 10 CFR 35.32. The Licensee further states that the fact that these violations derive from different root causes
is reinforced by the fact that the specific corrective action for one violation would not necessarily have prevented
the other. Based on this information, the Licensee believes that escalation of the base civil penalty under the ``multiple
examples'' factor is inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``prior enforcement history'' adjustment factor, the Licensee believes that the application of this
factor was inappropriate in this case, noting that the Quality Management rule has become effective only recently,
and there has been no opportunity to develop an enforcement history for compliance with this rule. Just as the Enforcement
Policy recognizes that this factor should not be applied where the Licensee has not been in existence long enough to
establish a performance history, the Licensee contends that so too should this logic be applied in establishing performance
history for quality management violations. On this basis, the Licensee contends that escalation of the base civil
penalty is unwarranted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the other factors, the Licensee believes that, on balance, the remaining adjustment factors warrant mitigation
even though none was applied. Regarding the ``identification'' factor, the Licensee notes that the current Enforcement
Policy streamlines the applicability of this factor to situations where the Licensee identified the violations
and promptly reported them to the NRC. The Licensee argues that, in both cases, following identification of the violation,
the hospital thoroughly evaluated the events and promptly provided the NRC with the results in letters to the NRC Region
I office, dated December 22, 1992, January 4, 1993, and February 5, 1993. Based on this information, the Licensee believes
that full mitigation on this factor is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``corrective action'' factor, once the violations were identified, the Licensee maintains it took
prompt action to bring the situations into compliance. Immediate corrective actions were implemented to assure
that fully safe conditions were restored and that further noncompliance with the NRC's requirements was halted.
In addition, as evidenced by the NRC's inspection report dated December 30, 1992, the Licensee maintains that it had
already developed proposed long-term corrective actions, ``at the time of the inspection,'' which was the day after
the incident was reported. Given this information, the Licensee believes that further mitigation due to this factor
is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Licensee maintains it had no prior opportunity to identify the two specific violations, neither misadministration
resulted in doses to the patients that exceeded the prescribed doses by more than 20 percent of the total prescribed
doses, nor are they believed to result in any significant detriment, and therefore, no escalation is warranted for
these factors. In summary, when the circumstances surrounding the violations are fully considered, the Licensee
submits that significant mitigation of the proposed civil penalty for Violation II is warranted.

NRC Evaluation of Licensee Response Requesting Mitigation of the Civil Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has evaluated the Licensee response and has determined, as set forth below, that the Licensee has not provided
an adequate basis for any mitigation of the civil penalty. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the NRC considered
the escalation and mitigation factors set forth in the NRC Enforcement Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the issues provided in the Licensee's response as a basis for mitigation of the penalty, the NRC acknowledges
that the Licensee performed an independent assessment on May 10 and 11, 1993, to improve implementation of the radiation
safety program. However, this commitment was made only after these violations were identified by the NRC as a result
of inspections conducted on December 3 and 4, 1992, and January 26 and 27, 1993, at the Licensee's facility. Nevertheless,
the NRC mitigated the base civil penalty for corrective action for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C by 50 percent, the maximum
recommended under the enforcement policy. No further mitigation is warranted under this factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the violations in Section I, the Licensee states that the NRC, contrary to established practice in
Section VI.B.2.(c) of the Enforcement Policy, used an enforcement action which occurred in 1989 as part of its inspection
history to establish a basis for the 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty for licensee performance. The NRC
agrees that prior performance normally refers to the licensee's performance within the last two years of the inspection
at issue, or the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer. However, Section VI.B.2.(c) also states
that the base civil penalty may be escalated by as much as 100 percent if the current violation is reflective of the licensee's
poor or declining prior performance. While the NRC did mention the escalated action issued in 1989 in its April 26,
1993, cover letter to the Notice of Violation, it also referred to an escalated action that was issued in 1992, which
is within the two year/two inspection period. Viewed collectively, the past enforcement actions demonstrate a declining
trend in performance at the Licensee's facility. Additionally, the escalated enforcement action issued in 1989
involved the Licensee's loss of control of a cesium-137 sealed source and subsequent improper disposal. The Licensee's
corrective action for this incident was not broad and lasting, and did not prevent recurrence of a similar violation
described in Section I of the Notice issued April 26, 1993, involving the loss of a cesium-137 brachytherapy sealed
source. Based on the above, the NRC believes that the 100 percent escalation for Licensee performances, was a proper
application of the Enforcement Policy in determining the civil penalty amount of $2500 for the violations in Section
I. As for the Licensee's contention regarding identification of Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C, the NRC in the Notice
proposed 50 percent mitigation, which is the maximum recommended under the enforcement policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The escalation/mitigation factors for the violations in Section II were applied consistent with the Policy. Regarding
the ``multiple examples'' factor, the violations both involved the failure to meet the specific objective that each
administration is in accordance with the written directive. The QMP was inadequate in that it did not contain procedures
that provide high confidence in the delivery process of therapeutic radiation and the accurate administration of
the prescribed dose. The administering physician's inattention to detail was the root cause and primary contributing
reason for the occurrence of both misadministrations at the facility within a short period. In violation II.A, the
physician failed to observe that one of four sources fell into the patient's bed, while in violation II.B, the physician
failed to use any visual means to verify correct insertion of the sources. Had either physician paid adequate attention
while inserting the sources, or if the Licensee's QMP had provided specific procedures to verify correct source insertion,
these violations would likely have been averted. Therefore, based on the fact that both events were due to the same
root cause, escalation on this factor was warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ``prior performance'' factor, while there is no history in the quality management area given its
recent implementation, the Licensee's poor and declining overall performance in the radiation safety area of the
medical program warrants escalation of the penalty on this factor, as set forth above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``identification'' factor, the NRC maintains that, while the two misadministrations were self disclosing,
the associated quality management violations were identified by the NRC. In both events, the Licensee did not identify
the failure of the QMP to include written policies and procedures to meet the objective that each brachytherapy administration
is verified to be to the proper treatment site in accordance with the respective written directive. In each case, the
NRC identified the failure to establish adequate written procedures to ensure the Licensee's proper placement of
brachytherapy source(s) at the prescribed treatment site. Therefore, on balance, no adjustment by the NRC on this
factor was warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ``corrective action'' factor, the actions taken in response to these violations were not considered
sufficiently prompt and comprehensive to warrant mitigation because they were initially narrowly focused on the
specific events, rather than on root causes, the QMP and improvements necessary to increase management oversight.
The Licensee did implement additional training and instruction in the loading and placement of brachytherapy sources
and applicators. However, the Licensee did not perform an extensive and comprehensive root cause analysis of the
two misadministrations. The corrective actions were narrowly focused and primarily directed at the performance
of visual checks and examinations of the sources and applicators before implantation. The corrective actions did
not include a comprehensive review of the QMP procedures to determine what written modifications might be necessary
to ensure compliance with the failed objective and program areas of concern. Additionally, the corrective actions
failed to address what changes in management oversight and involvement would be incorporated into the Licensee's
QMP to prevent recurrence of similar events and improve supervision of brachytherapy activities. Following the
second event and discussions with NRC, a more comprehensive approach was adopted. However, on balance, no adjustment
on this factor is warranted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC concludes that the Licensee has not provided an adequate basis for mitigating any portion of the civil penalties.
Accordingly, the NRC has determined that monetary civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 should be imposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from December 13, 1993, through
December 22, 1993. The last biweekly notice was published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67840).

Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed changes would not involve an increase in the probability or the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change only allows flexibility in the scheduling of the three required Type A tests in the
10-year service period. The additional flexibility is needed for plants using 18-month fuel cycles to allow refueling
outages and testing intervals to coincide. There is no change to the number of tests required, test methodology, or
acceptance criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change to the test schedule only provides flexibility in meeting the same requirement for
three tests in a 10-year period. The testing type and bases have not changed. Therefore, operation of the units with
this more flexible test schedule will not result in an accident previously not analyzed in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed changes do not impact the design bases of the containment and do not modify the
response of the containment during a design basis accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes would not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to the schedule
only provides flexibility in meeting the same requirement for three tests in a 10-year period. These proposed changes
do not affect or change any limiting conditions for operation (LCO), or any other surveillance requirements in the
TS, and the basis for the surveillance requirement remains unchanged. The testing method, acceptance criteria,
and bases are not changed. The TS continue to require testing that is consistent with the requirements of Appendix
J to 10 CFR 50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would permit extending the time to perform leak rate testing of certain containment isolation
valves so that the testing can be performed during the refueling outage scheduled to start April 16, 1994, rather than
requiring an earlier shutdown solely to perform the testing. The proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirements
4.6.1.3d and 4.6.1.3f to allow a one-time extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment
isolation valves. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirements 4.4.3.2.2a and 4.4.3.2.2b,
replacing the requirement to leak test the reactor coolant pressure isolation valves every 18 months or prior to returning
a valve to service, with a requirement to leak test the valves in accordance with the Inservice Testing Program. This
would allow the testing to be performed during the fifth refueling outage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed changes would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the proposed technical specification (TS) changes requests a one-time only extension of the surveillance
intervals for the TS Surveillance Requirements of TS 4.6.1.3f, leak rate testing of valves sealed by the main steam
positive leakage control system (MS-PLCS) and the penetration valve leakage control system (PVLCS). The revision
would permit eleven containment isolation valves to be tested a maximum of 46 days later than required by current technical
specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To permit the one-time extension of the surveillance interval for leak rate tests of containment isolation valves,
TS 4.6.1.3d must also be revised to permit the interval for Type C leak rate tests to exceed 24 months. This change is
consistent with an associated exemption request. The exemption request and this revision would permit 20 valves
to be tested a maximum of 35 days later than required by the current technical specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also revise Surveillance Requirements 4.4.3.2.2a and 4.4.3.2.2b, replacing the requirement
to leak test the reactor coolant pressure isolation valves every 18 months or prior to returning a valve to service,
with a requirement to leak test the valves in accordance with the Inservice Testing Program. This change would require
that the pressure isolation valves be tested in accordance with Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,
resulting in the valves being tested at least every refueling outage, rather than specifying an 18 month cycle. The
revision would permit five valves to be tested a maximum of 65 days later than allowed under the current technical specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the short duration of the requested extensions, the extensions will not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes permit extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment isolation
valves and reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves. In that the requested extension durations are small
as compared to the overall interval allowed by TS, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes permit extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment isolation
valves and reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves. In that the requested extension durations are small
as compared to the overall interval allowed by TS, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change corrects Technical Specification pages issued for Amendment 166 for
Brunswick Unit 1 and Amendment 197 for Brunswick Unit 2, regarding NUMAC Steam Leak Detection Equipment. Specifically,
on page 3/4 3-29 for each unit, the Channel Calibration frequency of Item 4.a.4, HPCI [High Pressure Core Injection]
Steam Line Tunnel Temperature - High, was inadvertently left as quarterly (Q) rather than being revised to refuel
(R). The text of CP&amp;L's September 14, 1992 license amendment request and the NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments
166 and 197, dated October 14, 1993, addressed the frequency change from quarterly to refuel for this item. Therefore,
the proposed change is purely administrative in nature and can not involve a significant increase in the probability
of consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments 166 and 197, dated October 14, 1993, addressed
the frequency change from quarterly to refuel for Item 4.a.4 of Table 4.3.2-1, HPCI Steam Line Tunnel Temperature
- High. Therefore, the proposed change is purely administrative in nature and can not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change
corrects Technical Specification pages issued for Amendment 166 for Brunswick Unit 1 and Amendment 197 for Brunswick
Unit 2, regarding NUMAC Steam Leak Detection Equipment. The NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments 166 and 197, dated
October 14, 1993, addressed the change of Channel Calibration frequency of Item 4.a.4, HPCI Steam Line Tunnel Temperature
- High from quarterly (Q) to refuel (R). Therefore, the proposed change is purely administrative and can not involve
a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed change would modify the Technical Specifications incorporated in Facility Operating License No.
DPR-45 in accordance with the requirements of the revised 10 CFR Part 20 which becomes mandatory January 1, 1994 (56
FR 23360). In addition, this proposed change would correct several editorial oversights from previous amendments.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee provided the results of its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards
consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the information provided by the licensee and found that the licensee did
not provide specific information as to how it determined that the three standards of 50.92(c) were satisfied. The
NRC staff performed its own evaluation of the proposed change to determine if the three standards of 50.92(c) were
satisfied. The NRC staff's no significant hazards consideration evaluation is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to bring the LACBWR Technical Specifications into conformance with the revised 10 CFR Part
20 and to correct several editorial oversights previously evaluated. The proposed change has no affect on any plant
operating parameters. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to bring the LACBWR Technical Specifications into conformance with the revised 10 CFR Part
20 and to correct several editorial oversights previously evaluated. The proposed change is administrative in nature.
Further, the proposed change does not result in any physical alteration to any plant system, and does not result in
any change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. Consequently, the proposed change
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is the difference between the value of a critical design, operating, or post accident parameter,
and the value of the parameter which would produce unacceptable results. The proposed change does not affect any hardware,
has no effect on the current operating methodologies or actions which govern plant performance, and does not affect
any accident analysis parameter. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has determined based on its own no significant hazards consideration evaluation that the three standards
of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no
significant hazards consideration.

The Waterford 3 Type A test history provides substantial justification for the proposed test schedule. Three type

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no structural mechanisms which would adversely affect the structural capability of the containment and
that would be a factor in extending the Type A test schedule to ten years. A risk impact assessment was performed, and
a determination was made that there is no risk impact as a result of changing the Type A test schedule. Therefore, the
proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no design changes being made that would create a new type of accident or malfunction. The proposed change
will not alter the plant or the manner in which it is operated. The change proposes a change to the schedule for performing
the periodic Type A test. The purpose of the test is to provide periodic verification by test of the leaktight integrity
of the primary reactor containment, and systems and components which penetrate containment. The tests assure that
leakage through containment and systems and components penetrating containment will not exceed the allowable leakage
rate values associated with conditions resulting from an accident. The change in schedule for performing the Type
A test will not adversely affect the containment integrity in the event of an accident. Therefore, the proposed change
will not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is a change to the schedule for performing the periodic Type A tests and does not reduce the margin
of safety assumed in accident analysis for release of radioactive materials from the containment atmosphere into
the environment or any margin of safety preserved by the Technical Specifications. The methodology, acceptance
criteria, and the technical specification leakage limits for the performance of the Type A tests will not change,
and the Type A tests will be performed in accordance with 10CFR 50, Appendix J, and the Waterford 3 licensing basis.
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to provide acceptable conditions for operation
when (1) the core operating limits supervisory system (COLSS) is in service and neither control element assembly
calculator (CEAC) is operable and (2) the COLSS is out of service and either or both CEACs are operable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change modifies the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) margin, Limiting Condition for
Operation (LCO) 3.2.4b and c, which limits the core power distribution to the initial value assumed in the accident
analyses. Operation within this LCO either limits or prevents potential fuel cladding failures in the event of a postulated
accident and limits damage to the fuel cladding during an accident by ensuring that the plant is operating within acceptable
conditions at the onset of a transient. The limiting safety system settings and this LCO are based on the accident analysis,
so that specified acceptable fuel design limits (SAFDLs) are not exceeded as a result of anticipated operational
occurrences (AOOs) and the limits of acceptable consequences are not exceeded for other postulated accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COLSS and core protection calculators (CPCs) monitor the core power distribution on line and are capable of verifying
that the linear heat rate (LHR) and DNBR do not exceed their limits. The COLSS performs this function by continuously
monitoring the core power distribution and calculating core power operating limits corresponding to the allowable
peak LHR and DNBR. The CPCs perform this function by continuously calculating an actual value of DNBR and LHR for comparison
with the respective trip setpoints. CEACs monitor CEA position. Should a CEA deviate from its subgroup position,
the CEACs will transmit an appropriate ``penalty'' factor to the CPCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COLSS is normally used to monitor DNBR margin. When at least one CEAC is operable, TS 3.2.4a provides enough margin
to DNB to accommodate the limiting AOO without failing the fuel. When neither CEAC is operable, the CPCs lack the CEA
position information necessary to ensure a reactor trip when necessary. In this case TS 3.2.4b requires the COLSS
calculated core power to be reduced to ensure that the limiting AOO will not result in fuel failure. Currently, TS 3.2.4b
requires that the COLSS calculated power be maintained at 13% below the COLSS calculated power operating limit to
compensate for the potential error in the CPC DNBR calculation. The proposed revision would increase this required
adjustment to 16%, which is more restrictive than the present value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In instances when the COLSS is out of service, but either or both CEACs are operable, TS 3.2.4c states that the DNBR operating
margin shall be maintained by comparing the DNBR indicated on any operable CPC channel with the allowable value from
TS Figure 3.2-2. Whenever the COLSS is out of service, the CPCs are used to perform the same monitoring function. However,
the extra conservatisms built into the CPCs for transient protection are not all required when the CPCs are being used
for monitoring. In order not to affect the CPC transient protection, these conservatisms are not taken from the CPC,
but are credited in the COLSS out-of-service limits in Figure 3.2-2. A reevaluation of the limiting AOOs has verified
that, by maintaining the margin in the proposed Figure 3.2-2, sufficient margin exists to ensure that the limiting
Cycle 7 AOO will not result in fuel failure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For the case when neither CEAC is operable but COLSS is in service, the CPCs assume a preset CEA configuration and can
not obtain the required CEA position information to ensure the SAFDL on DNBR will not be violated during an AOO. Thus,
as a result of limiting AOOs for Cycle 7, Specification 3.2.4b requires that core power be reduced to a value 16% less
than the current COLSS calculated power operating limit. This ensures the limiting AOO will not result in a violation
of SAFDLs. The proposed revision to Figure 3.2-2 accounts for the situation when COLSS is out of service but at least
one CEAC is operable. In this case, the Cycle 7 safety analysis has shown that by maintaining the CPC calculated DNBR
above the value shown in the figure, the limiting AOO will not result in a violation of the SAFDLs. Therefore, the proposed
change will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are primarily a result of changes in Cycle 7 core parameters. These changes do not involve any
change to any equipment or manner in which the plant will be operated. These changes further restrict the plant operation
when either COLSS or both CEACs are out of service. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this Specification is to ensure that there is always sufficient margin to DNB such that the CPCs can mitigate
the consequences of the most limiting AOO prior to a violation of the SAFDLs. Generally, this margin is continuously
monitored by COLSS; however, if COLSS is out of service, but at least one CEAC is operable, the limitation on CPC calculated
DNBR (as a function of ASI [axial shape index]) shown in Figure 3.2-2 represents a conservative envelope of operating
conditions consistent with the Cycle 7 safety analysis assumptions. This band of operating conditions has been analytically
demonstrated to maintain an acceptable minimum DNBR through all AOOs. On the other hand, for the case when COLSS is
in service, but neither CEAC is operable, the proposed change will ensure that the limiting AOO will not result in a
violation of SAFDLs. Therefore, the proposed changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the request is to change the plant Technical Specifications (TS) to remove the limiting conditions
for operation and surveillance requirements for the chlorine detection system. TMI-1 removed the gases Chlorination
System for the Circulating Water and River Water Systems. This modification eliminated the need for a Chlorine Dectection

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The TS requirements assured
the operability of the CDS in the event of an on-site chlorine release from a one ton cylinder. These TS requirements
reduced the probability and the consequences of a radiological accident which may result from an incapacitation
of control room operatorsafter entry of chlorine into the control room. With the removal and the restriction on delivery
of one ton chlorine cylinders, this postulated event is no longer credible, and there is a decrease in the probability
of a radiological accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The TS requirements associated with the CDS were
for the on-site release of chlorine from a one ton cylinder. These cylinders are removed and prohibited from the TMI-1
site. These actions preclude a significant on-site release of chlorine which could affect the control room operators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The purpose of the TS requirements was to maintain operability of the CDS in the event of on-site
release from a one ton chlorine cylinder. Since chlorine cylinders greater than 150 pounds are prohibited on-site,
the TS requirements for chlorine detection are no longer required, and their removal will not reduce the margin of
safety.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change seeks to eliminate the unnecessary testing of an operable Standby Diesel Generator (SDG). Technical
Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1 Actions a. and e. require all operable SDGs be started as a demonstration of operability
whenever one or more of the offsite AC [alternating current] power sources is declared inoperable. The inoperability
of an offsite AC power source has no effect on the reliability of a SDG. Deleting this requirement does not affect the
design or performance characteristics of the SDGs. Therefore, the SDGs maintain their ability to perform their design
function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS 3.8.1.1 Actions b. and c. require all remaining operable SDGs be started as a demonstration of operability whenever
one of the SDG is declared inoperable except for preplanned preventive maintenance or testing. The proposed amendment
would expand the testing exclusion to include an inoperable support system and an independently testable component
in addition to preplanned preventive maintenance and testing. The proposed amendment would also eliminate the testing
requirement of the remaining operable SDGs, when a SDG is declared inoperable, unless there is cause to believe a potential
common mode failure exists for the remaining SDGs. The normal TS surveillance testing schedule assures that operable
SDG(s) are capable of performing their intended safety functions. A failure of one SDG does not reduce the reliability
of another, otherwise operable SDG. Deleting this requirement does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of the SDGs, once a common mode failure has been dismissed. Therefore, the SDGs maintain their ability to perform their
design function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of these unnecessary tests does not affect the design bases of the SDGs, or any of the accident evaluations
involving the SDGs. The SDGs are designed to provide electrical power to the equipment important for safety during
all modes and plant conditions following a loss of offsite power. The test schedule established in accordance with
GL 84-15 [``Proposed Staff Actions To Improve and Maintain Diesel Generator Reliability''] assures that operable
SDGs are capable of performing their intended safety function. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed change does not affect the design bases, accident analysis, reliability or capability of the SDGs
to perform their intended safety function, this change does not involve any reduction in a margin to safety.

1. Operation of Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed license amendment does not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no TSP restraint) at room temperature conditions shows burst
pressures in excess of 5000 psi for indications of ODSCC with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing
performed on pulled tubes from Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 with up to a 2.02 volt indication shows measured burst in excess
of 10,000 psi at room temperature. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength
levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the RG 1.121
criterion requiring the maintenance of a margin of 3 times normal operating pressure differential on tube burst.
The 3 times normal operating pressure differential for the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 steam generators corresponds
to 4275 psi. Based on the existing data base, this criterion is satisfied with 7/8
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes less than 4.9 volts, regardless of the
indicated depth measurement. A 1.0 volt plugging criteria compares favorably with the structural limit considering
the previously calculated growth rates for ODSCC within the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 steam generators. Considering
a voltage increase of 0.4 volts, and adding a 20% NDE uncertainty of 0.20 volts (90% Cumulative Probability) to the
IPC of 1.0 volts results in an EOC voltage of approximately 1.6 volts for Cycle 14 operation. A 3.3 volt safety margins
implied (4.9 structural limit - 1.6 volt EOC - 3.3 volt margin). This EOC voltage compares favorably with the Structural
Limit of 4.9 volts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the voltage/burst correlation, the EOC structural limit is supported by a voltage of 4.9 volts. A 3.1 volt BOC repair
limit confirms the structural limit when 40% growth and 20% uncertainty are applied to the repair limit. This repair
limit will be applied for Cycle 14 IPC implementation to repair bobbin indication greater than 3.1 volts independent
of RPC confirmation of the indication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservatism of this repair limit is shown by the EOC 12 (Summer 1992) eddy current data. The overall average voltage
growth was determined to be only 2.2%, with a 12% average voltage growth for indications less than 0.75 volt BOC and
a 1% average voltage growth for indication >0.75 volt at the BOC. In addition, the Cycle 12 maximum observed voltage
increase was found to be 0.49 volts, and occurred in a tube initially &lt;1.0 BOC. In accordance with the technical
specification requirements, the applicability of Cycle 13 growth rates for Cycle 14 operation will be confirmed
prior to return to power of Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1. Similar large structural margins are anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, TSP proximity to the tubes will prevent tube burst during all plant conditions. Test data indicates
that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes which have 100% through-wall EDM notches, 0.75 inch long,
provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Therefore, a more realistic assessment of tube operability
should be performed against the RG 1.121 loading requirements during accidents SLB conditions, since the TSP has
the potential to deflect during blowdown following a main SLB, thereby uncovering the intersection. At the ASME Code
recommended faulted condition loading of 3657 psi (2560 psi/0.7) structural integrity is provided for bobbin voltage
indications of a minimum of 9.6 volts. The repair limit based on the structural limited conservative SLB conditions
would be 6.0 volts (compared to a 3.1 volt repair limit for a structural limit based on the 3[delta]P burst capability
voltage).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only three indications of ODSCC have been reported to have operating leakage, and all three have been in European plants.
No field leakage has been reported at other plants from tubes with indications of a voltage level of under 7.7 volts
(from 3/4'' tubing). Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously
established that a postulated main SLB outside of containment but upstream of the MSIV represents the most limiting
radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the IPC, it will be determined whether
the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the EOC 14 are projected to be such that primary
to secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. The SLB
leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 will be used to calculate EOC
14 leakage. Due to the relatively low voltage growth rates at Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 and the relatively small number
of indications affected by the IPC, SLB leakage prediction per draft NUREG-1477 is expected to be less than the acceptance
limit of 1.0 gpm in the faulted loop and far below the conservatively calculated SRP based allowable value of 120 gpm
in the faulted loop. The NRC leakage rate calculation methodology applies a 98% confidence limit on leakage that is
independent of voltage. This method for calculating SLB leakage is conservative as it assumes no correlations exists
between SLB leakage and bobbin probe voltage. Tube pull results from Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 indicate that tube wall
degradation of greater than 40% through-wall was detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with maximum
through-wall penetration of 56% (42% average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest recorded
bobbin voltage from the EOC 12 eddy current data. All burst tested tube intersections had degradation depths of 40%
to 56 % (actual) deep and all were detected by both probes, with all bobbin voltage grater than or equal to 1.0. Since
the criteria requires the plugging of >1.0 volt bobbin indications with confirmed RPC calls, using the Cook Nuclear
Plant Unit 1 pulled tube destructive examination results, it is reasonable that no indications of degradation greater
than 40% to 56% deep with an ability to influence tube burst capability were left in service. Since the majority of the
EOC 14 indications at Cook Nuclear Unit 1 are expected to be below this level, the inclusion of all IPC intersections
into the leakage calculation is exceptionally conservative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as re-implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC during Cycle 14 does not adversely affect steam generator tube
integrity and results in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated within the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 FSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed steam generator tube IPC does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design
basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in a tube rupture outside of the region of
the TSP elevations; no ODSCC is occurring outside the thickness of the TSPs. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture
event would be expected in a steam generator in which the plugging criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Cook Nuclear Plant will continue to implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd (0.1 gpm) per steam
generator to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The Cycle 14 Technical
Specification limits on primary to secondary leakage at operating conditions is a maximum of 0.4 gpm (600 gpd) for
all steam generators, or, a maximum of 150 gpd for any one steam generator. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing
operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leaks-before-break consideration to
detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture. The 150 gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and
plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated
with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits
are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with
the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length that provides a safety factor
of 3 against bursting at normal operating pressure differential. A voltage amplitude of 4.9 volts for typical ODSCC
corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at a lower 95% prediction limit on the burst correlation coupled
with 95/95 LTL material properties. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to 4.9 volts so that a unique crack
length is not defied by the burst pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical burst pressure versus
through-wall crack length correlations are used below to define the ``longest permissible crack'' for evaluating
operating leakage limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At current plant conditions, the single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 3 times normal operating
pressure differential and SLB conditions are 0.44 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd will provide
for detection of 0.42 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.61 inch long cracks at the lower 95% confidence level
leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the
potential for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack
must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical
crack lengths for SLB conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria at Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 is demonstrated
to maintain steam generator tube integrity commensurate with the criteria of Regulatory Guide 1.121. RG 1.121 describes
a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting GDCs 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences
of steam generator tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam
generator tubing, as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be
removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence
of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted
plant conditions. The EOC 14 distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in
acceptable primary to secondary leakage during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not
adversely impacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the combined effects of LOCA + SSE on the steam generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been
determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators at some plants. This is the case as the TSPs may become
deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the plant due to the combined effects
of the LOCA rarefaction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting pressure differential on the deformed tubes may
cause some of the tubes to collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing
reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow are increases the resistance to flow of steam from
the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential
that partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 reactor coolant
loop piping, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered
in the structural design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line brake or the pressurizer
surge line break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 smaller breaks.
The results of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude
to result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing RG 1.83 consideration, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria
of 1.0 volt is supplemented by the following: enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to proved consistency
in voltage normalization, a 100% eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and RPC inspection requirements
as outlined in the technical specifications and Appendix A ``NDE Data Acquisition and Analysis Guidelines'' (Attachment
6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes which
must be repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs reduce the RCS flow margin. Thus, implementation
of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of
increased tube plugging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction
in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any of the plant Technical Specifications.

The proposed amendments delete certain Limiting Conditions for Operation, Actions, and Surveillance Requirements
for Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves in the Technical Specifications. The Technical Specifications
for these Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves were added by Order dated April 20, 1981. This Order was
prompted by concerns for an interfacing system loss-of-coolant accident as identified in the Reactor Safety Study
(WASH-1400). The proposed Technical Specification change, by inference, also requests rescission of the April
20, 1981 Order.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment to an operating license will not involve a significant hazards consideration
if the proposed amendment satisfies the following three criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously analyzed or evaluated,
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISLOCA is not one of the accidents previously analyzed in Chapter 14, Safety Analysis, of the Cook Nuclear Plant
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Chapter 14 analyzes the large break LOCA in Section 14.3.1, and ``loss of reactor
coolant from small ruptured pipes or from cracks in large pipes which actuates the ECCS'', or small break LOCA in Section
14.3.2. Therefore, deleting from the Technical Specifications the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves
in Table 3.4-0, will not increase the probability or the consequences of the large break or the small break LOCAs previously
analyzed for the Cook Nuclear Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves in Table 3.4-0 of the Technical Specifications were added because
WASH-1400 identified the ISLOCA as a significant contributor to core damage frequency. Deletion of the subject valves
from the Technical Specifications and reliance on the testing requirements mandated by the In-Service Testing Program
of ASME XI does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from the large break or the small break
LOCAs previously analyzed for the Cook Nuclear Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves from the testing requirements in Table 3.4-0 of the
Technical Specifications will result in these valves only being tested on a refueling outage frequency as part of
the ASME B&amp;PV Code Section XI IST Program. This somewhat reduced testing frequency will result in a slight increase
in the ISLOCA contribution to core damage frequency of 5.4%, from lower 5.00E-08/reactor year to mid 5.00E-08/reactor
year. This insignificant increase will not affect the overall core damage frequency of 6.26E-05/reactor year. Therefore,
it is concluded that the proposed deletion of the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves in Table 3.4-0
of the Technical Specifications, as well as the proposed deletion of the portions of the Technical Specifications
that are affected by Table 3.4-0, will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety that exists at Cook
Nuclear Plant to prevent an ISLOCA or to mitigate the consequences of an ISLOCA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A change to the defined restricted area has no affect on any plant operating parameters. Consequently, a change to
the defined restricted area will not affect the probability or consequences of an accident occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the HBPP TS are administrative in nature. Further, the proposed changes would not result
in any physical alteration to any plant system, and there would not be a change in the method by which any safety-related
system performs its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the HBPP TS do not affect the margin of safety of any accident analysis since they do not affect
the parameters for any accident analysis, and have no effect on the current operating methodologies or actions which
govern plant performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve eliminating the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitoring (MSLRM) system high radiation
trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the Main Steam Line Isolation Valves
(MSIVs), Main Steam line drain valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves. The proposed TS changes
support installation of a plant modification to defeat portions of MSLRM system high radiation trip function logic
circuitry in the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Primary Containment and Reactor Vessel Isolation Control System
(PCRVICS). Installation of this modification will not adversely impact the operation of the RPS or PCRVICS with respect
to performing its other intended safety functions. The proposed TS changes will not affect the operation of other
plant systems or equipment important to safety. The MSLRM system high radiation trip function for the Mechanical
Vacuum Pump (MVP) will be retained. The safety assessment and justification for eliminating the MSLRM system high
radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs [are] based
on General Electric's (GE's) Topical Report NEDO-31400A, ``Safety Evaluation for Eliminating the Boiling Water
Reactor Main Steam Line Isolation Valve Closure Function and Scram Function of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor,''
and the applicability of this report to Limerick Generating Station (LGS), Units 1 and 2. By letter dated May 15, 1991,
the NRC approved this topical report and indicated that it was acceptable for licensees to reference this report as
the basis for requesting a TS change to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip functions as documented in the
report and associated NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety assessment provided in NEDO-31400A can also be applied to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip
function for initiating the automatic closure of the Main Steam line drain valves although this aspect was not explicitly
evaluated in NEDO-31400A. The flow from these valves ultimately discharges to the main condenser as do the MSIVs and
therefore, any radioactive material passing through these valves would be processed in the same fashion as that passing
through the MSIVs. The effects of eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating the closure
of the Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves is [are] negligible. The sample lines are routed to a sample sink
where inlet valves installed on the sample lines are normally closed. Additionally, downstream of the inlet valves
are needle valves designed to control and limit sample line flow. The sample sink is enclosed, and air vented from its
exhaust hood is passed through filters prior to release to the environment. There is the potential that a minimal amount
of radioactive material could be released to the environment if the sample sink inlet and needle valves failed to properly
function. This potential release has been evaluated and determined to a small fraction of the dose limit requirements
specified in 10 CFR 100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MSLRM system high radiation trip was intended to function in response to a Control Rod Drop Accident (CRDA), a Design
Basis Accident previously evaluated. Although the CRDA assumes MSIV closure, no credit was taken for this in the CRDA
analysis since it postulates that the radioactive material calculated to be released from the fuel is transported
to the main condenser prior to the MSIVs completely closing. Furthermore, the probability of a fuel failure is independent
of the operation of the MSLRM system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Steam Jet Air Ejectors (SJAEs) will continue to operate to remove non-condensable gases from the main condenser
for processing by the Offgas Treatment system. The Offgas Treatment system will continue to function as designed
to reduce offgas radioactivity levels prior to release to the environment. Eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation
isolation functions will improve operational flexibility in that the main condenser will be available to aid in decay
heat removal. Elimination of the MSLRM system high radiation trip functions in conjunction with proper operation
of the Offgas Treatment system will ensure that any radioactive material released to the environment is a small fraction
of 10 CFR 100 limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes associated with eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for
initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam line drain valves, and Main Steam
and Reactor Water sample line valves do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic
reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam Line drain valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample
line valves. The proposed TS changes will not affect the operation of other plant systems or equipment important to
safety. The associated plant modification simply defeats the MSLRM system high radiation trip function logic circuitry
in the RPS and PCRVICS. The RPS and PCRVICS will continue to respond in performing its other design intended safety
functions. The MSLRM system high radiation trip function for the MVP will be retained. The proposed TS changes do not
involve any plant hardware changes that could introduce any new failure modes or effects. The MSLRM system radiation
monitors will remain active to initiate Main Control Room (MCR) annunciation alarms. Plant procedures will be in
place to implement the appropriate mitigative measures in response to a MSLRM system high radiation alarm signal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SJAEs will continue to operate to remove non-condensable gases from the main condenser for processing by the Offgas
Treatment system. The Offgas Treatment system will continue to function as designed to reduce offgas radioactivity
levels prior to release to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Design Basis Accident analysis (i.e., CRDA) does not credit the MSLRM system high radiation trip function
for reducing the radiological consequences of the postulated accident, the proposed TS changes have effectively
been evaluated and are included in the existing analysis. That is, the CRDA analysis already assumes that the radioactive
material released from the failed fuel is immediately transported to the main condenser prior to the MSIVs completely
closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety assessment and assumptions documents in GE Topical Report NEDO-31400A provide the basis for eliminating
the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of
the MSIVs. The safety assessment provided in NEDO-31400A can also be applied to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation
trip function for initiating the closure of the Main Steam Line drain valves, since any radioactive material passing
through these valves would be processed in the same fashion as that passing through the MSIVs. Eliminating the MSLRM
system high radiation trip function for initiating the closure of the Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves
will have a negligible impact. The sample lines are routed to a sample sink where inlet valves installed on the sample
lines are normally closed. Downstream of the inlet valves are needle valves designed to control and limit sample line
flow. The sample sink is located in the Reactor Enclosure and is enclosed, and air vented from its exhaust hood is passed
through filters prior to release to the environment. The Reactor Enclosure ventilation duct radiation monitor samples
air from the sample sink hood exhaust, and will isolate the Reactor Enclosure ventilation system if the radiation
levels exceed the monitor's setpoint. There is the potential that a minimal amount of radioactive material could
be released to the environment through this flowpath if the sample sink inlet and needle valves failed to properly
function. This potential release has been evaluated and determined to a small fraction of the dose limit requirements
specified in 10CFR100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor
scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam line drains valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line
valves do not change the conclusion reached in the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) that the calculated
radiological consequences of the bounding Design Basis Accident (i.e., CRDA) will not exceed the dose limit requirements
established by 10 CFR 100. The proposed TS changes will improve the overall reliability of the plant when compared
to the existing system lineup configuration, since it will reduce the potential of an unnecessary plant transient
occurring as a result of an inadvertent MSIV closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reliability assessment analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation
reactor scram function on reactivity control failure frequency and core damage frequency in GE Topical Report NEDO-31400A.
This analysis indicated that there is a negligible increase in reactivity control frequency with the elimination
of the MSLRM trip function. However, this increase is compensated for by the reduction in transient initiating events
(i.e., inadvertent reactor scrams). This reduction in transient initiating events represents a reduction in core
damage frequency and thus, results in a net improvement in safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would extend the surveillance interval of the primary containment drywell-to-suppression chamber
bypass leak test from the current 18-month interval as required by Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement
4.6.2.1.d to a 40 +/- 10-month interval. This change would allow the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass test
to coincide with the 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)) interval.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure effects that are potentially created by the proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes have been
considered. The accident which is potentially negatively impacted by the proposed TS changes are any Loss of Coolant
Accident (LOCA) inside primary containment with or without offsite power available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes increase the surveillance interval of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test
required by TS Section 4.6.2.1.d, and will require that an additional test be performed on the downcomer vacuum breakers
assemblies. The primary containment structure and associated equipment are not considered to be accident initiators,
they act to mitigate the consequences of an accident. There are no physical or operational changes being made as a result
of these proposed changes. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated is not increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a potential increased risk that an increase in the bypass leakage may go undetected for the duration of the
proposed extension of the interval between the performance of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test.
However, as discussed below, the increased risk is considered to be negligible due to the design of the diaphragm structure
and past test data. Therefore, we have concluded that the probability of bypass leakage exceeding the allowed value
is not increased as a result of the proposed TS changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes will extend the surveillance interval for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak
test from 18 months to 40 +/^ 10 months. These proposed changes would allow this test to be performed at the same interval
as the 10CFR50, Appendix J, Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)). In addition, the
proposed changes will add an additional surveillance requirement to be performed on the vacuum breaker assemblies
during refueling outages when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is not required to be performed.
The proposed TS changes do not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This is based on the
evaluation summarized below that demonstrates that the overall impact, if any, on the plant containment integrity
is negligible. Furthermore, the performance history for the previous LGS bypass leak tests does not indicate any
time based failures. The proposed TS changes also include a change to the frequency of testing, if two consecutive
tests fail, from once every nine (9) months to once every 24 months in order to coincide with the 24 month refueling cycle.
This change has no impact on the consequences of an accident based on maintaining the original requirement to increase
the frequency of testing if two consecutive bypass leak tests fail, and maintaining a TS requirement for the NRC to
review the schedule for subsequent tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a LOCA inside containment, potential leak paths between the drywell and suppression chamber airspace could
result in excessive containment pressures, since the steam flow into the airspace would bypass the heat sink capabilities
of the suppression pool. The containment pressure response to the postulated bypass leakage can be mitigated by manually
actuating the suppression chamber sprays. Accordingly, since the sprays are manually actuated, an analysis was
performed to show that the operator has sufficient time to initiate the sprays prior to exceeding the containment
design pressure. This analysis is described in section 6.2.1.1.5 of the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report
(UFSAR). The analysis is based on a small break LOCA inside containment with a differential pressure between the drywell-to-suppression
chamber equal to the static pressure due to downcomer submergence. The analysis concludes that the containment design
pressure of 55 psig will be reached in over 30 minutes from the onset of a small break LOCA assuming a drywell-to-suppression
chamber bypass flow area (i.e., A/square root of k) equal to 7.20 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 without operator intervention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS Limiting Condition for Operation 3.6.2.1.b conservatively specifies a maximum allowable bypass area of 10 % of
the design value of 7.20 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. This TS limit provides an additional safety factor of 10 above the conservatism taken in the steam bypass analysis
(i.e., 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test required by TS Surveillance Requirement 4.6.2.1.d verifies
that the actual bypass flow area is less than or equal to the TS limit of 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The bypass leakage test ensures that degradation in the measured bypass area is identified and corrected to ensure
containment integrity during LOCA events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential bypass leakage paths can be divided into two categories as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Leakage pathways other than those associated with the drywell-to-suppression chamber vacuum breaker assemblies
such as diaphragm floor penetrations (i.e., downcomer and Safety/Relief Valve (SRV) discharge line penetrations),
cracks in the diaphragm floor and/or liner plate, and cracks in the downcomers and SRV discharge lines that pass through
the suppression chamber airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The four sets of drywell-to-suppression chamber vacuum breaker assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other potential bypass leakage pathways have at least two isolation valves in the potential leakage path. These
valves are high quality leak-tight containment isolation valves that are normally closed and receive an isolation
signal to close. All Air Operated Valves (AOVs) in these paths fail closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several plant design features and the bypass leak test data measured to date confirm that the leakage from other than
the vacuum breaker assemblies is negligible and indicates that this leakage will continue to be negligible for the
proposed increased duration between tests. All pressure boundary penetrations between the drywell and the suppression
chamber are welded except the vacuum breaker valves and the blind flanges closing 10 spare nozzles in the downcomers.
All pressure boundary penetrations between the drywell-to-suppression chamber have been fabricated, erected,
and inspected in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section III, Subsection
NC, 1971 Edition, with the exception of the tees supporting the vacuum breakers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The downcomer and SRV discharge lines penetrate through the diaphragm slab and terminate in the suppression pool.
A steel ring plate is welded to the outside of the downcomers. The downcomer/ring plate assemblies are embedded in
the diaphragm slab with the top surface of the ring plate flush with the drywell side of the diaphragm slab. All connections
are welded to form a continuous steel membrane between the liner plate and downcomer penetrations. The SRV discharge
lines are routed through welded flued heads at the diaphragm floor. The flued head design and construction are similar
to the downcomer penetrations and also provide a continuous steel barrier. The downcomer and SRV discharge lines
are designed and constructed to safety-related requirements. In addition, they are designed for all postulated
loading conditions, including seismic, hydrodynamic, pressure, and temperature loads. The conservative design
requirements ensure that the SRV discharge and the downcomer lines will not contribute to bypass leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diaphragm floor is a reinforced concrete slab approximately 3.5 feet thick. The drywell side surface of the diaphragm
slab is capped with a 1/4 inch thick carbon steel liner plate. The liner plate and diaphragm slab provide a barrier against
the potential for bypass leakage through the diaphragm floor. The structural integrity of the diaphragm floor and
penetrations was demonstrated during the pre-operational test program. The drywell was pressurized to a drywell-to-suppression
chamber differential pressure of above 30 psid, which envelopes the maximum drywell-to-suppression chamber differential
pressure postulated to occur during LOCA conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been six Unit 1 and three Unit 2 bypass leak tests performed in accordance with TS Surveillance Requirement
4.6.2.1.d. These tests were conducted at a drywell-to-suppression chamber differential pressure of at least 4.0
psid. The measured leakage area includes leakage from both the vacuum breakers and sources other than vacuum breakers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases, the measured leakage is significantly less than the TS and design values. The maximum measured leakage
areas are 0.0400 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 0.0111 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively; or 5.56% and 1.55 %, respectively, of the TS limit. The average values are 0.0180
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and 0.0107 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 2; or 2.5% and 1.49%, respectively, of the TS limit of 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The minimum measured leakage areas are 0.0 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 0.0100 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively, or 0% and 1.3 %, respectively, of the TS limit. Clearly, the test data confirm that
the bypass leakage measured to date at LGS has been negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we have obtained bypass leakage data from the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Susquehanna Steam
Electric Station (SSES), Units 1 and 2, which also has Mark II containments with the Anderson Greenwood vacuum breakers
(i.e., the same manufacturer as the vacuum breakers installed in the LGS, Unit 1 and Unit 2 containments) and therefore
the data is applicable to LGS. The maximum bypass leakage area for the SSES Unit 1 containment was 0.037 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 0.009 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the SSES Unit 2 containment, or 4.81% and 1.17%, respectively, of the SSES TS limit. Approval for a similar TS change
for SSES, Units 1 and 2 was issued by the NRC by letter dated August 11, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining and most likely source of potential bypass leakage is the four sets of drywell-to-suppression chamber
vacuum breakers. Each set consists of two vacuum breakers in series, flange mounted to a tee off the downcomers in the
suppression chamber airspace. The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is currently required by TS
Surveillance requirement 4.6.2.1.d to be completed during each refueling outage and the results are used to verify
that the total bypass area, including that due to the vacuum breakers, meets the TS limit. If maintenance has been performed
on the vacuum breakers, this test also serves as a post-maintenance vacuum breakers leakage area test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes decrease the frequency of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test. The drywell-to-suppression
chamber bypass leak test data obtained following vacuum breakers maintenance cannot be utilized to determine vacuum
breakers leakage reliability over the duration of the proposed test interval extension. To address this concern
and collect additional vacuum breakers leakage data, the proposed TS changes include an additional requirement
to perform a vacuum breaker leakage test as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leakage test will be conducted on each set of vacuum breakers (i.e., four vacuum breakers sets per unit) during
each refueling outage when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test would not be required to be performed.
If maintenance is performed on the vacuum breaker assemblies, this additional test will be performed post-maintenance
to verify that the leakage is acceptable. This test will be conducted at a drywell-to-suppression chamber differential
pressure of 4.0 psid (i.e., the same as differential pressure required for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass
leak test) by either pressurizing the drywell side of the vacuum breakers or inducing a vacuum on the suppression chamber
side of the vacuum breakers. The acceptance criteria for the vacuum breaker leakage tests will be as follows. The total
vacuum breaker leakage areas for all four sets of vacuum breakers will be less than or equal to 24% of the TS limit (i.e.,
0.24 x 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 = 0.173 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). This proposed acceptable vacuum breaker leakage area provides a 76% margin to the TS limit to account for the leakage
paths other than the vacuum breakers. As described above, previous bypass leakage testing measured a maximum bypass
leakage area of 5.56% of the TS limit. The 76% margin is sufficiently large to accommodate the other expected leakage
sources. In addition, each set of vacuum breakers will be limited to a leakage area twice the assumed leakage from a
single vacuum breaker set, assuming the leakage area is evenly distributed among the four sets of vacuum breakers
(i.e., four sets equate to 24% of the TS Limit where each set is 6% and twice this total is 12% of the TS Limit). This allows
a leakage of less than or equal to 0.0865 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i.e., (0.173 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 divided by 4 sets of vacuum breakers) x (a factor of 2 times the acceptable total) = 0.0865 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) for an individual set of vacuum breakers. This criterion is stipulated to identify individual sets of vacuum breakers
with higher leakage area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test data obtained during previous testing at LGS demonstrates
conformance by a large margin compared to the TS and design leakage requirements. The test data indicates that there
is negligible risk that the bypass leakage will change adversely in future years. Furthermore, the proposed test
frequency is judged to be acceptable based on the risk of the leakage sources other than the vacuum breakers being essentially
equivalent to that of the rest of the primary containment structure, which is leak tested (i.e., CILRT) every 40 +/^
10 months as required by TS Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.a. A bypass leak test will be developed and conducted
to verify acceptable vacuum breaker bypass leakage areas for those outages when the bypass leak test will not be required
to be performed. The proposed vacuum breaker leakage test with stringent acceptance criteria, combined with other
negligible leakage areas, provide an acceptable level of assurance that the bypass leakage can be measured and an
adverse condition can be detected and corrected such that the existing level of confidence that the primary containment
will function as required during a LOCA is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test frequency. There are no physical
or operational changes as a result of these proposed changes. These proposed changes include the requirement to perform
an additional surveillance test on the vacuum breaker assemblies, applying a differential pressure of 4.0 psid which
is the same differential pressure as currently required by TS for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak
test. This required test will ensure that acceptable vacuum breaker leakage is maintained during those intervals
when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is not required to be performed. Furthermore, the affected
structure (i.e., primary containment) acts as an accident mitigator and not as an accident initiator. Accordingly,
the possibility of a different type of malfunction of equipment or the possibility of an accident of a different type
is not introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test data obtained during previous testing at LGS demonstrates
conformance by a large margin to the TS and design leakage requirements. The test data indicate that there is negligible
risk that the bypass leakage will change adversely in future years. Furthermore, the proposed test frequency is judged
to be acceptable based on the risk of sources of leakage other than the vacuum breakers being essentially equivalent
to that of the rest of the primary containment structure, which is tested every 40 +/^ 10 months. A bypass leak test will
be developed and conducted to verify acceptable vacuum breaker bypass leakage areas for those outages when the bypass
leak test will not be required to be performed. The proposed vacuum breaker leakage test with stringent acceptance
criteria, combined with the other negligible potential leakage areas, provide an acceptable level of assurance
that the bypass leakage can be measured and an adverse condition can be detected and corrected such that the existing
levels of confidence that the primary containment will function as required during a LOCA is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the consequences of an accident are not impacted by this change and containment integrity during a LOCA
will be maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change, which would delete the requirement to demonstrate the
operability of an otherwise operable EDG once the potential for a common cause failure has been dismissed, does not
affect the design or performance characteristics of an EDG. Similarly, deleting the requirement to demonstrate
the operability of EDGs when an offsite power source is inoperable does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of an EDG. Therefore, the EDGs will maintain their ability to perform their design function. The EDGs are not assumed
to be an initiator of any analyzed event. The role of the EDGs is the mitigation of accident consequences. Therefore,
this proposed TS change does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated could be affected by the proposed TS change. As described above,
implementation of the proposed change will result in the EDGs maintaining their ability to perform their design function.
Excessive testing of EDGs can cause reduced reliability. Precluding unnecessary testing of operable EDGs will improve
EDG reliability and thereby have an overall positive affect on plant safety. Therefore, this proposed TS change does
not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change will not involve physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components (SSC). The design or performance characteristics of the EDG will not be affected by the proposed change.
The proposed change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation or make any changes to system setpoints which
would initiate a new or different kind of accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TS change
does not affect the design or performance of any EDG. The change will increase EDG reliability by reducing the stresses
on the EDG from unnecessary testing. This will result in an overall increase in plant safety. Therefore, the proposed
change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change would eliminate the listing of specific position titles for the Plant Operations Review Committee
(PORC) composition in favor of allowing the Plant Manager to appoint PORC members. This would eliminate the need to
change the Technical Specifications (TSs) in the future whenever a position title is changed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed TS change is administrative in nature. The PORC member titles will be removed from
the TS to facilitate not requiring that a TS change be submitted for NRC approval when position titles change. PORC
member qualifications will continue to be consistent with those required for the Facility Staff and meet or exceed
Sections 4.2, 4.4, or 4.6 of ANSI N18.1-1971. The proposed change ensures that PORC will continue to be comprised of
personnel involved in daily plant activities who are experienced individuals with varied expertise. By maintaining
the qualification requirements for members of PORC who represent various areas of expertise, PORC will continue
to fulfill its requirements specified in TS Section 6.5.1.6. The proposed change does not involve any physical changes
to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the manner in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified,
tested, or inspected. Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change will not involve physical changes to plant SSC or the manner
in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, tested or inspected. The proposed change does not introduce
any new modes of plant operation or make any changes to system setpoints which would initiate a new or different kind
of accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated
is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TS change
is administrative in nature by providing internal flexibility in changing organizational titles and does not reduce
the PORC function or responsibilities. PORC will continue to be filled by appropriately qualified personnel who
have a variety of expertise. The change does not affect the plant material condition, operation, or accident analyses.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any change to the configuration or
method of operation of any plant equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Also, the proposed changes
do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the FSAR accident analyses. Since the FSAR accident analyses remain
bounding, the radiological consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

method of operation of any plant equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident.Accordingly, no new failure
modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting failure been
identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes are administrative
in nature and will continue to ensure that the response times for the RTS and ESFAS instrumentation do not exceed the
limits assumed in the accident analyses. As a result of the proposed changes, response time limits for the RTS and ESFAS
will be administratively controlled in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59, thus eliminating an unnecessary
burden of governmental regulation without reducing protection for public health and safety. Therefore, the proposed
changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments provide an administrative vehicle for modifying a condition of the facility operating license
for each of the BFN units. The condition requires the licensee to implement and maintain in effect all provisions of
the ``Fire Protection Program (FPP)'' and lists the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff safety evaluations
(SE) approving the FPP. If the staff approves of a revision currently under review to an element of the FPP, the ``Appendix
R Safe Shutdown Program (SSP)'', the proposed amendments would add the staff SE documenting approval of the revised
SSP to the above listing of SEs in each facility operating license. The current SSP is directed toward the safe shutdown
of only one operating plant (Unit 2). The revised SSP would be directed toward the safe shutdown of two operating plants
(Units 2 and 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed amendments add the definition of the SSP to Section 1.0 of the Unit 3 Technical Specifications

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would delete reference in the BFN Unit 3 Technical Specifications (TS) to the Reactor Water
Cleanup (RWCU) system floor drain high temperature switches and the RWCU system space high temperature switches.
The piping configuration for the Unit 3 RWCU system has been modified, and the licensee contends that its revised High
Energy Line Break (HELB) analysis has demonstrated that these switches are no longer required. Instead, to initiate
RWCU system isolation, the HELB analysis has indicated the need for temperature switches in the main steam vault,
the heat exchanger room, and the RWCU pipe trench. The proposed amendment therefore would add temperature switches
to the Unit 3 TS for these areas and modify the TS Bases section accordingly. The proposed amendment also adds clarifying
remarks to Tables 3.2.A and 3.2.B of the TS for each of the BFN units. The proposed remarks list the actuation signals
for the various primary containment valve group isolations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of HELBs in the Unit 3 reactor building identified certain RWCU pipe breaks which could not be automatically
detected and isolated in a reasonable time frame. To resolve this issue, a design change is being performed to remove
from service the existing non-environmentally qualified temperature switches used to detect RWCU line breaks and
replace them with environmentally qualified RTDs [resistance temperature detectors] and IEEE [Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers] Class 1E qualified ATUs [analog trip units] located to detect and isolate the critical
RWCU pipe breaks. This TS amendment adds the new ATUs [sic] function to Tables 3.2.A and 4.2.A. Note 14 is deleted from
Table 3.2.A since it only applies to the temperature switches being removed from the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function of the RTD/ATU temperature loops is to provide an isolation signal to close the RWCU suction line
isolation valves (FCV-69-001 and FCV-69-002) and RWCU return line valve (FCV-69-012) on a high area temperature.
This ensures RWCU pipe breaks are isolated. No other RWCU safety functions are affected by the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new RTD/ATU temperature loops were chosen to decrease the time required to initiate closure of the RWCU valves.
This improves the detection/isolation of RWCU breaks and helps to limit the reactor coolant lost, helps ensure core
cooling, and helps ensure that environmental conditions inside the reactor building are maintained within the required
limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Components added by this change are qualified for the environment in which they will operate. This ensures that the
system will perform its function in a post accident environment. No additional paths for the release of radiation
or contamination are created. The failure modes of the RTDs and ATUs are such that any single failure will result in
a gross failure alarm and/or a channel trip. Because of the redundancy, separations, and logic designed into the system,
a single failure of any part of the system will not prevent isolation of the primary containment isolation valves and
spurious operation is minimized. The RTDs will be located and the instrument setpoints will be set to preclude spurious
trips due to ambient temperatures including localized hot areas while assuring a timely trip due to a pipe break. Therefore,
the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change is being made to improve the RWCU leak detection/isolation function of the RWCU Primary Containment Isolation
System (PCIS). The PCIS will perform its intended safety function in the same manner as the previous installation.
There is no affect [sic] on the function or operation of any other plant system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure of the RTD/ATU temperature loops would be no different than failure of existing temperature switches. Since
environmental qualification requirements, divisional separation, single failure requirements and one-out-of-two
taken twice logic requirements are maintained, the possibility of a RWCU isolation failure on a RWCU line break or
of a spurious isolation is no more likely after the change than before.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the existing design, logic relays are powered from RPS Bus A or B. The new design also uses RPS Bus A or B to feed the ATUs.
Therefore, the consequence of a power failure is unchanged from the present design. The seismic qualification and
proper circuit coordination of the installation is maintained. The system functions and operates in the same manner
as previously evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report. No new system interactions other than additional RTDs located
in the main steam valve vault to input into the PCIS logic for isolation of the RWCU have been introduced by this activity.
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety will be enhanced by installing instruments that provide quicker response to a temperature rise
indicative of a pipe break. Calculations have been performed to determine the analytical limits for the RTD/ATU temperature
loops in each of the monitored areas and to determine the setpoints for the ATUs in each area. The setpoints are set above
the maximum expected room temperatures to avoid spurious actuations due to ambient conditions and below the analytical
limits to ensure timely detection of a pipe break. This type of design utilizing ATUs has been analyzed by the NRC [U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff] (NEDO-21617, Analog Transmitter/Trip Unit System for Engineered Safeguard
Sensor Trip Input) and has been found to be generically acceptable at BWR facilities. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would change the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&amp;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the surveillance frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps
from monthly to quarterly in accordance with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical
Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' dated
September 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has completed a comprehensive examination of surveillance requirements in TS that require testing at power.
The evaluation is documented in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements,''
dated December 1992. The NRC staff found, that while the majority of testing at power is important, safety can be improved,
equipment degradation decreased, and an unnecessary burden on personnel resources eliminated by reducing the amount
of testing at power that is required by TS. Based on the results of the evaluations documented in NUREG 1366, the NRC
issued Generic Letter 93-05. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Auxiliary Feedwater System supplies water to the steam generators to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant
System. To ensure operability of the Auxiliary Feedwater System, the pumps are currently tested on a monthly basis
as required by the TS. Consistent with Generic Letter 93-05, Item 9.1 and NUREG-1366, the licensee is requesting a
change to the surveillance testing frequency for the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps from monthly to quarterly on a staggered
test basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes
will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequencies of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not significantly affect
the probability of occurrence or consequences of any previously evaluated accidents. Quarterly testing of the pumps
on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its
intended functions. Therefore, the change in frequency of testing the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not
affect the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not involve any physical modification
of the plant or result in a change in a method of operation. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps
on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its
intended function. Therefore, a new or different type of accident is not made possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not affect any safety limits
or limiting safety system settings. System operating parameters are unaffected. The availability of equipment
required to mitigate or assess the consequence of an accident is not reduced. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater
System pumps on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing
its intended functions. Safety margins are, therefore, not decreased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the Technical Specification to (a) reduce the slope of the axial power imbalance penalty in
the overtemperature-delta temperature reactor protection system trip setpoint equation, and (b) increase the
boron concentration limits in the cold leg accumulators, the refueling water storage tank, the reactor coolant system,
and refueling canal during MODE 6 conditions. These changes reflect the reloading of Unit 1 with Mark BW fuel for Cycle
8 including an increase in cycle length from 350 effective full power days (EFPD) to 390 EFPD.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the Technical Specifications (TS) Figure 2.1-1, certain TS Table 2.2-1 factors in the equation
for the OVERTEMPERATURE delta T and OVERPOWER delta T setpoints, and Figure 3.2-1 to reflect a reduction in the required
minimum measured reactor coolant system (RCS) flow rate from 385,000 gallons per minute (gpm) to 382,000 gpm for Unit
1. Catawba Unit 2 values are unchanged and, accordingly, certain TS pages were modified to retain the current TS values
in effect for Unit 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for these changes is attributed to the effects of steam generator tube plugging and to a hot leg temperature
streaming phenomenon. The application also proposed to revise the text of TS 2.1.1 and the definition for TS Figure
2.1-1. These changes are not related to the changes in RCS flow rate. The staff is continuing to review these proposed
changes and, accordingly, they are not dealt with in this amendment.

These amendments increase the shutdown margin requirements for the current operating cycle at both units; reduce
the containment pressure high-high setpoint and allowable value; and change the containment spray system, containment
fan cooler and service water system response times. These changes were necessitated by the discovery of containment
fan cooler unit and containment spray system response times greater than originally assumed for Loss of Coolant Accident
(LOCA) or Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) analysis, and auxiliary feedwater system flow greater than assumed for the
MSLB analysis.

Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards
Consideration and Opportunity For a Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By February
4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Brief description of amendment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment changes the existing technical specifications (TS) by adding a footnote to TS 4.4.5.0 to address steam
generator (SG) operability requirements. The change references an unscheduled inspection of the 1C SG which occurred
due to a tube leak in that SG. The amendment was required because the circumstances of the inspection were not covered
by the existing TS 3/4.4.5. It will allow SG operability requirements to be satisfied until the next SG inservice inspection,
scheduled to begin no later than March 5, 1993.

On October 27, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33241 (November 23, 1993),

 The CXM is a standardized basket product consisting of twenty-five shares of each of the stocks included in the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's (``Merc'') ``MMI'' futures contract. That contract is based on the American Stock Exchange's
(``Amex'') Major Market Index (``MMI''), a broad-based price-weighted index of twenty stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (``NYSE'').

Exchange Act Release No. 33053 (October 15, 1993), 58 FR 54610 (October 22, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;93&hyph;18)
(``CXM Approval Order'').

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to extend the hours for trading the CXM until 3:15 Central time (4:15 Eastern time). This proposal
will make the trading hours of the CXM consistent with the trading hours of derivative products that are based on the
same index as the CXM and other derivative products that could be used as a hedge against the CXM. According to the Exchange,
similar trading hours should provide risk management benefits when trading the CXM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

In recent years, concerns have been raised about the role that index-related trading strategies (e.g., use of the
equity cash market to hedge positions in stock index futures and options contracts) played in increasing market volatility.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Commission has, among other things, encouraged the national securities exchanges to list and trade
standardized baskets of stocks.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that, in comparison to other methods of portfolio trading, basket products, such as the CXM,
are an efficient means to make investment decisions based on the direction of standardized measures of stock market
performance, and may enhance the market's ability to absorb program trading.

In addition to the CXM, the Commission has approved the trading of market baskets on the NYSE and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (``CBOE''). See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27382 (October 26, 1989), 54 FR 45834 (October 31,

The Commission has concluded that extending the trading hours for the CXM will enhance market participants' ability
to use that basket for hedging purposes. The CXM offers a highly correlative hedge to the Merc's ``MMI'' futures contract.
In addition, the CXM could be used to offset a position in the options on the MMI futures contract that are traded on the
Merc; in the options on the MMI that are traded on the Amex; or in derivative products on other broad-based stock market
indexes.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 At the moment, however, CXM trading ends at 3 Central time (4 Eastern time), while trading of such derivative products
continues until 3:15 Central time (4:15 Eastern time). The Commission recognizes that the current lack of coordination
may hinder market participants' ability to adjust their risk in response to late price movements in the derivatives
market.

For example, the promotional literature for the CXM illustrates how that basket could be used as a hedge against the

Accordingly, the Commission believes that synchronizing the close of trading for the CXM with the close of trading
for such derivative products will allow market participants to hedge their positions more effectively. Specifically,
traders and investors will be able to employ closing strategies that reflect price movements that take place during
the last fifteen minutes of derivatives trading, as well as complete last sale information for the various indexes'
component stocks. To the extent that the CHX proposal will promote fair hedging opportunities, the Commission finds
that extended trading hours should increase volume in the CXM, thereby adding to the depth and liquidity of the market
for that basket product.

The Commission used a similar rationale in approving extended trading hours for stock index options. See Securities

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC proposes to amend Article Ten of its Articles of Incorporation and Article VI, Section 1 of its By-Laws to limit
or eliminate the potential monetary liability of its directors to the extent permitted by the Illinois Business Corporation
Act except where such liability is the result of a violation of the federal securities laws.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and statutory basis for the
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposal. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors under certain circumstances.
The proposed change is based on Section 2.10(b)(3) of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, under which MSTC is organized,
which allows corporations to adopt provisions in their articles of incorporation that limit or eliminate the potential
monetary liability of directors under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General corporate law imposes a fiduciary duty of care upon each corporate director. This duty of care requires a director
to exercise informed business judgment in good faith and to act with an honest believe that the action taken is in the
best interest of the corporation. The proposal will not eliminate an MSTC's director's duty of care but will limit
the personal liability of an MSTC director to MSTC or its shareholders should the director fail through negligence
or gross negligence to satisfy his or her duty of care.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Under Illinois law, such limitations of personal liability do not apply in certain situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC's proposal will limit a director's liability even if that director had been grossly negligent provided that
the director exercised informed business judgment in good faith and acted with an honest belief that the action taken
was in the best interest of the corporation. Because there has been no judicial interpretation on the scope of the applicable
Illinois legislation, it is possible that an Illinois court may find as a matter of law that a director cannot act in
a manner that is both grossly negligent and in good faith.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will prohibit limitation of a director's liability in instances where liability arises directly or
indirectly as a result of a violation of federal securities laws. The proposal will not eliminate equitable remedies
such as rescission or injunctive actions. Moreover, it will not eliminate the liability of an officer of MSTC for actions
taken in that capacity even if the officer is also a director. Finally, the proposal will not affect the liability of
a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting or eliminating directors' liability will help to ensure that MSTC will be able to recruit and retain competent
directors. Due to the increased number and magnitude of lawsuits against directors, many other corporations from
various states already have adopted provisions similar to those in MSTC's proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because it will remove an impediment
to attracting competent directors and thus will help assure the fair representation of shareholders and participants
in the selection of directors and in the administration of MSTC's affairs.

Description and Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1984, the Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19d&hyph;1 to allow SROs
to submit, for Commission approval, plans for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, in 1985, the Commission approved an NYSE Plan for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations
pursuant to Rule 19d&hyph;1(c) under the Act. The Plan relieves the NYSE of the current reporting requirements imposed
under section 19(d)(1) of the Act for violations listed in NYSE Rule 476A. The NYSE Plan, as embodied in NYSE Rule 476A,
provides that the Exchange may designate violations of certain rules as minor rule violations. The Exchange may impose
a fine, not to exceed $5,000, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, or registered or
non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a violation of the delineated rules by issuing a citation
with a specific penalty.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Such person can either accept the penalty, or opt for a full disciplinary hearing on the matter. Fines assessed pursuant
to NYSE Rule 476A in excess of $2,500 are not considered pursuant to the Plan and must be reported in a manner consistent
with the current reporting requirement of section 19(d)(1) of the Act. The Exchange also retains the option of bringing
violations of rules included under NYSE Rule 476A to full disciplinary proceedings, and the Commission expects the
Exchange to do so for egregious or repeat violations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1984), 49 FR 23828 (June 8, 1984). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)
of Rule 19d&hyph;1, an SRO is required to file promptly with the Commission notice of any ``final'' disciplinary action
taken by the SRO. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 19d&hyph;1, any disciplinary action taken by an SRO for a violation
of an SRO rule that has been designated a minor rule violation pursuant to the Plan shall not be considered ``final''
for purposes of section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the sanctioned
person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his or her administrative remedies.
By deeming unadjudicated minor violations as not final, the Commission permits the SRO to report violations on a periodic,
as opposed to immediate, basis.

, only those fines imposed that are not in excess of $2,500 are subject to periodic reporting. Fines imposed pursuant

In adopting Rule 19d&hyph;1, the Commission noted that the Rule was an attempt to balance the informational needs
of the Commission against the reporting burdens of the SROs.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In promulgating paragraph (c) of the Rule, the Commission was attempting further to reduce those reporting burdens
by permitting, where immediate reporting was unnecessary, quarterly reporting of minor rule violations. The Rule
is intended to be limited to rules which can be adjudicated quickly and objectively.

The NYSE currently is adding its procedures with respect to entry and cancellation of MOC orders on expiration days
to the list of minor rule violations subject to the Rule 476A minor rule violation plan. The MOC order entry and cancellation
procedures require, for example, that MOC orders be entered on the Exchange by 3:40 p.m. on expiration days if they
are related to a strategy including any stock index future, stock index option or option on stock index future in expiring
contracts, and that no cancellations of such orders be effected after 3:40 p.m. Violations of these policies could
include late entry of MOC orders, entry of MOC orders which do not offset a published imbalance of 50,000 shares or more
in a pilot stock or an improper cancellation of an MOC order. These procedures are announced to members and member organizations
through an Information Memo issued approximately one week before each expiration day.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of sections 6(b)(1), (6) and (7), 6(d)(1) and 19(d) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members
and persons associated with its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violations of rules of the exchange.
In this regard, the proposal provides an efficient procedure for appropriate disciplining of members for a rule violation
that is technical and objective in nature. Moreover, because the Plan provides procedural rights to the person fined
and permits a disciplined person to request a full hearing on the matter, the proposal provides a fair procedure for
the disciplining of members and persons associated with members, consistent with sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of
the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also believes that the proposal provides an alternate means by which to deter violations of the NYSE
rules included in the Plan, thus furthering the purposes of section 6(b)(1) of the Act. An exchange's ability to effectively
enforce compliance by its members and member organizations with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory
functions. Inclusion of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan should not be interpreted to mean it is an
unimportant rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that inclusion of rules under a minor rule violation
plan may not only reduce reporting burdens on an SRO but also may make its disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting
violations of these rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because the NYSE retains the discretion to bring a full disciplinary proceeding for any violation included
on the List, the Commission believes that adding the procedures for entry and cancellation of MOC orders on expiration
days to the List will enhance, rather than reduce, the NYSE's enforcement capabilities of these Exchange procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, MOC procedures are subject to change on a monthly basis and are outlined in an Information Memo
disseminated to the members and member organizations prior to each expiration day. The Commission believes that
whether a member or member organization has followed such specifically outlined procedures is amenable to quick,
objective determinations of compliance with respect to activity on each expiration day. The quick and efficient
resolution of questions of compliance with such procedures would facilitate the Exchange's ability to induce continued
compliance without being hindered by the additional time and cost associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission believes that the inclusion of the MOC procedural rules will prove to be an effective alternate
response to a violation when the initiation of a full disciplinary proceeding is unsuitable because such a proceeding
may be more costly and time-consuming in view of the minor nature of the particular violation. This is further reinforced
by the nature of the monthly dissemination of these procedures to the members and their potential for change each month
in response to the instruments affected on the expiration day and the surrounding circumstances at that time. By including
the MOC procedures in the Rule 476A Minor Rule Violation List, the NYSE can quickly respond to violations, thereby
deterring similar infractions the following month.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 16, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification to NYSE policy would amend Paragraph 103 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (``Non-U.S.
Companies'') to permit non-U.S. issuers to distribute summary annual reports to U.S. holders, under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification to policy recognizes an amendment, adopted in 1990, to the U.K. Companies Act which permits
issuers listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide an option to holders of their ordinary shares to receive a full
annual report or a summary annual report. The Companies Act sets forth the specific financial and management information
that must be contained in the summary reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Companies Act, as amended, also requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity,
at any time, to obtain the full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually
of this right and how the report might be obtained. When the program was instituted in the U.K. in 1990, shareholders
received both reports and notice of the available option with respect to future reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain U.K. issuers are now seeking permission from the NYSE to provide holders of listed ADRs with summary reports
in place of full annual reports if the holders do not object. The proposed modification to policy is necessary to grant
permission since current policy requires all listed companies to submit to shareholders an annual report with financial
information as detailed in Paragraph 203.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The creation of the summary annual reports in the U.K. was prompted by two objectives: Potential cost savings to the
company and the ability to provide a more easily read document to retail holders. The effort has been deemed successful
in the U.K. since a majority of shareholders now receive the summary reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is proposing that the NYSE annual report requirements be modified to allow holders of NYSE-listed non-U.S.
securities to receive summary annual reports if (i) this is the practice in the home country and (ii) certain conditions
are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, issuers proposing to provide summary annual reports to ADR holders would be required to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) provide ADR holders with an ongoing option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Receive the full annual report on demand, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Annually change their election (as in the U.K., U.S. ADR holders would initially receive both reports and notice
of the available option with respect to future reports); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Follow the specific dictates of home country law or business practice with respect to the data presented; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Include a U.S. GAAP reconciliation to the extent that such reconciliation would be required in the full annual
report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would be consistent with the Exchange's policies for non-U.S. companies which effectively allow these
companies to follow home country practice in such areas as interim reporting and corporate governance. In addition,
we believe the modification to policy would be consistent with the SEC's posture toward non-U.S. companies of being
accommodating without compromising disclosure.

2. Statutory Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have
rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties. However, the Exchange
adopted this proposed rule change, in part, in response to a petition from eight listed U.K. companies requesting
that the exchange allow them to use summary annual reports.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Minneapolis-St. Paul International
(Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective December
10, 1993. Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved
or disapproved on or before June 8, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review
and comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional non-compatible uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission submitted to the FAA on March 30, 1992, noise exposure
maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during the FAR Part 150 Noise Compatibility Study
from March 1991 to March 1992. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described
in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and
surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the Minneapolis-St.
Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission. The specific maps under consideration are the 1991 existing Noise Exposure
Map and the 1996 future Noise Exposure Map. The FAA has determined that these maps for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International
(Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport are in compliance with the applicable requirements. This determination is effective
on December 10, 1993. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that
the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination
does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility
program or to fund the implementation of that program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detail overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator who submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain
Field) Airport, also effective on December 10, 1993. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that
it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be
necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of
180 days, will be completed on or before June 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, &sect;150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Northwest Mountain Region of the Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA'') and the Port of Seattle (``Port'')
announce that the FAA and the Port, acting as joint lead agencies, intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for a proposal by the Port to develop a new parallel runway and other airport facility improvements to be examined
in an update to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac Airport) Master Plan. To ensure that all significant
issues related to the proposed action are identified, scoping comments are requested.

To facilitate the receipt of written comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted. The first meeting, in a workshop
format, will be conducted for the public on February 9, 1994. A meeting for Federal, state and local agencies will be
conducted on February 10, 1994. Send comments to, or seek additional information from the responsible Federal official:
Mr. Dennis Ossenkop, Airports Division, Federal Aviation Administration, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., suite 540, Renton,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Recent planning studies have indicated both an existing and long-term need for additional airfield capacity at Sea-Tac
Airport. Under current demand levels, the Airport experiences reduced operating capability and delay during bad
weather conditions due to the close-spacing of the existing parallel runways. During busy hours, arrival demand
exceeds the bad weather arrival capacity and aircraft and passenger delays result. In addition to increasing the
severity of delays caused by bad weather, continued growth in aircraft operational demand is projected to exceed
Sea-Tac's annual airfield capacity within the next ten years. The objective of the Master Plan Update, and accompanying
EIS, is to address the bad weather capacity problem and to meet long-term regional air travel needs spurred by a growing
regional economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared for the Master Plan Update, which is expected to include
numerous projects including, but not be limited to: A new parallel runway and improvements to the passenger terminal,
ground access system, and other support facilities. The range of new parallel runway options that may be considered
in the EIS are anticipated to be in the immediate vicinity of the existing airfield at Sea-Tac Airport. Based on the
Master Plan Update, other airport developments that may be considered in the EIS would be located on or in the immediate
vicinity of the existing Sea-Tac Airport property. Mitigation measures will be proposed, as necessary, for the significant
adverse impacts created by development. Major actions or concepts to be discussed in the draft EIS include the no action
alternative and other reasonable alternatives meeting the purpose and need. Such alternatives are expected to include
several options related to runway lengths, separations and threshold stagger.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA and Port of Seattle have determined that the new parallel runway is likely to have a significant adverse impact
on the environment. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required under the National Environmental Policy
Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c) and will be prepared. The FAA
and Port of Seattle have identified the following key areas for discussion in the EIS including, but not limited to:
Alternatives, noise and land use, social and socio-economic impacts, human health, water resources, biotic communities,
construction, earth, transportation and air quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping is the initial step in the preparation of the EIS. The scoping process is ``an early and open process for determining
the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to the proposed action.'' Agencies,
affected tribes, and members of the public are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. You may comment on alternatives,
mitigation measures, probable significant adverse impacts, and licenses or other approvals that may be required.
Comments and suggestions are invited from Federal, State and local agencies, and other interested parties and individuals
to ensure that the full range of issues related to a Master Plan Update EIS are addressed and all significant issues
identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the receipt of comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted. A public workshop will be conducted
to receive written comments on February 9, 1994 from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. at Tyee Senior High School, 4424 South 188th
Street, City of SeaTac. The second meeting will be held on February 10, 1994 between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. for Federal,
state and local agencies in the Sea-Tac Auditorium, Mezzanine Level Main Terminal Building, Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
