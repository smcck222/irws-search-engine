SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the Federal Seed Act regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and
red clover grown in Mexico and imported into the United States. The removal of the requirements is necessary to make
the regulations conform to the amendment of the Federal Seed Act by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act. The effect of this action is to relieve a restriction on importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are amending the Federal Seed Act Regulations in 7 CFR part 201 (referred to below as the regulations) by removing
the requirement that 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of each container of alfalfa or red clover grown in Mexico be stained red. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective
January 1, 1994. To implement this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments included in the Act become effective coincident with
NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment in this final rule is mandated by section 361(a) of the Act, which amended section 302(e)(1) of the Federal
Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1582(e)(1)) by providing that the provisions requiring certain seeds to be stained red shall not
apply to alfalfa or red clover seed originating in Mexico. (See Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is being taken to conform the regulations with the amendments to the Act, by amending &sect;201.104
of the regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and red clover grown in Mexico and
imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that good cause exists to publish this final rule without prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice and opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain regulatory actions must be taken as a result of the statutory amendments discussed in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' and must become effective with NAFTA to avoid inconsistency between the regulations and their statutory authority.
Removal of the origin staining requirement for alfalfa and red clover seed imported from Mexico is one of the regulatory
changes that must become effective at the same time as NAFTA and the Act to avoid this conflict. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action relieves a restriction on the importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico. Since prior notice
and other public procedures with respect to this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since this regulatory change is mandated by Congress, there is good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this final rule effective as of January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act, as amended, removes the requirement that alfalfa and red clover seed that is imported from Mexico be stained
red. This final rule conforms the regulations to the Act. We have no record of any alfalfa or red clover having been imported
from Mexico in the past 5 years, and we anticipate no importations in the foreseeable future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR part 322 (referred to below as the regulations) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
govern the importation into the United States of honeybees and honeybee semen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations were established pursuant to the Honeybee Act (7 U.S.C. 281 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et seq.) The Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;United States of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 322.1 of the regulations contains a footnote that includes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria set forth in the Honeybee Act for determining which countries may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in the regulations as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be imported into the United States. In this rule, we are amending that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
footnote to reflect amendments to the Honeybee Act made by section 361(d)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 361(d)(2) of the Act amended subsections (a) and (b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honeybee Act by providing the following: (1) That honeybees may be imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms as the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subspecies of honeybees; and (2) that honeybee semen may be imported from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. (See Pub. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103&hyph;182; 107 Stat. 2057). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends a footnote in the regulations that quotes the Act, in order to conform the footnote to the Act, as amended
by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the regulations will have no practical impact on importations of honeybees and honeybee semen from
Canada or Mexico since it merely quotes the Act. Furthermore, such importations are already allowed from any part
of Canada. Currently, the only regular movement of honeybees from Canada to the United States is a relatively insignificant
movement from the Maritime Provinces of Canada to northern New England. We anticipate that the amendments will have
little practical impact with regard to importations from Mexico. Sufficient numbers of honeybees are already available
in the United States to make it unnecessary to import honeybees or honeybee semen from Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The criteria for determining which countries may be listed in this part as countries from which honeybees or honeybee
semen may be imported into the United States are set forth in 7 U.S.C. 282. In this regard, 7 U.S.C. provides in relevant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In order to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees, and the introduction
of genetically undesirable germ plasm of honeybees, the importation into the United States of all honeybees is prohibited,
except that honeybees may be imported into the United States_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From countries determined by the Secretary of Agriculture_

(A) To be free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To have in operation precautions adequate to prevent the importation of honeybees from other countries where
harmful diseases or parasites, or undesirable species or subspecies, of honeybees exist; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) From Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture determines appropriate,
if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely
to remain, free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Honeybee semen may be imported into the United States only from:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1991, REA published a final rule on part 1773, at 56 FR 63354, concerning audits of REA borrowers. Part
1773 implements the standard REA security instrument provision requiring REA borrowers to prepare and furnish to
REA, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations,
and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to REA, audited and certified by an independent CPA, satisfactory
to REA, and accompanied by a report of such audit, in form and substance satisfactory to REA. A report of the audit was
defined in &sect;1773.1 to include the auditor's report, report on compliance, report on internal controls and management
letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The management letter is prepared by the CPA and addresses specific internal control, compliance, and other program
issues not typically addressed in the standard auditor's report, report on internal controls, or report on compliance.
The requirements for preparing a management letter are set forth in &sect;1773.34, Management Letter. This final
rule revises and clarifies &sect;1773.34(e). Section 1773.34 (e)(1)(i) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34
(e)(2)(i) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to test compliance with the loan and security instrument provision
requiring borrowers to maintain insurance. REA is currently reviewing its insurance requirements to determine
if these requirements are representative of current industry standards. Therefore, until such time as REA's review
is completed and revisions, if any, to current policies are finalized, CPAs will not be required to test for compliance
with the mortgage provision relating to insurance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1773.34(e)(1)(ii) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(iii) for telephone borrowers requires
CPAs to test for compliance with the loan and security instrument provision requiring funds to be deposited in banks
or other depositories designated in the loan documents or approved by REA. Because of the many and varied investing
activities available in today's economy, CPAs have questioned the definition of funds and what, if any, investments
are affected. This final rule provides a definition of funds for purposes of applying this part 1773.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iv) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(iv) for telephone borrowers requires
CPAs to review the financial and statistical report and state whether the information presented is in agreement with
the borrower's records. CPAs have questioned whether they are required to review a certified copy of the report obtained
directly from REA or whether they may review a copy represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA. This
final rule clarifies REA's requirement for CPAs to review a copy of the financial and statistical report represented
by the borrower as having been submitted to REA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iii) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(ii) for telephone borrowers requires
the CPA to state whether an REA borrower has complied with the provision of its loan and security instrument that requires
a borrower to obtain written approval of mortgagees to enter into any contract for the operation or maintenance of
all or any part of its property, or for the use of its property by others. This requirement clearly goes beyond the scope
of government auditing standards because it requires all contracts, even those that have little or no impact on financial
statement amounts, to be reviewed by the CPA for REA approval. This testing has, during the effective period of part
1773, translated into increased audit fees. To minimize the cost impact to REA borrowers yet provide REA the assurance
it requires, this final rule details the contracts that must be reviewed by CPAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also incorporates the illustrative management letter, as amended by these part 1773 revisions, issued
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in a Technical Practice Aid dated November 11, 1992. The
illustrative letter properly addresses the management letter requirements set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 and includes
specific language to ensure compliance with the promulgated auditing literature. As such, REA believes it is more
informative than the sample management letter previously provided in appendix C to part 1773.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to a procedural change within REA that will more efficiently process and review audit reports submitted by REA
borrowers, this final rule also amends &sect;1773.3, &sect;1773.20, and &sect;1773.21 to require borrowers to
submit to REA an additional copy of the audit, report on compliance, report on internal controls, and management letter
and revises &sect;1773.21 to require the submission of an additional copy of borrowers' plans for corrective action.

A proposed rule entitled Policy on Audits of REA Borrowers, published September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49442, invited interested
parties to submit comments on or before November 22, 1993. Comments were received from the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association (NRECA) and two certified public accounting firms. The comments submitted by NRECA were
based upon an analysis performed by the Accounting &amp; Depreciation Committee, a subcommittee of the Generation
and Transmission Managers Association Technical Advisory Committee, and were considered and concurred in by the
NRECA Accounting and Tax Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One accounting firm agreed with the proposed revisions in all respects. The other commenters agreed with the proposed
revisions; however, proffered additional revisions. The following paragraphs address the additional revisions

 Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 state that the certified public accountant's (CPA) workpapers must document whether
all regulatory assets and liabilities comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and have received REA approval. REA telephone borrowers
that comply with generally accepted accounting principles as required by part 32 of the Federal Communications Commission's
Rules and Regulations, Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies, are not required to obtain
specific REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities. Only REA electric borrowers must seek such approval.
Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 should be amended to specify that REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities
must only be documented for REA electric borrowers.

 Section 1773.9(c) states that pursuant to the terms of its audit agreement with the borrower, the CPA must immediately
report, in writing, all irregularities and all indications or instances of illegal acts, whether material or not
to: (1) The president of the borrower's board of directors; (2) the Director, Borrowers Accounting Division; and
(3) the Office of Inspector General. This requirement goes beyond that of generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) which limits reporting requirements for irregularities to material instances and instances
that cumulatively could have a material effect on the financial statements. GAGAS further limits the reporting of
illegal acts to only the top official of the entity arranging for the audit. REA should modify the requirements set
forth in &sect;1773.9(c) to correspond with the GAGAS requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA recognizes that certain procedures set forth in part 1773 exceed the requirements of a GAGAS audit and REA has acknowledged
that fact in the rule. The Office of Inspector General, in Departmental Regulation No. 1700&hyph;1, Basic OIG Investigation/Audit
Organization and Procedures, sets forth certain requirements that all Federal agencies within USDA must impose
upon nonFederal auditors. One of these requirements is that all irregularities or illegal acts, regardless of materiality,
discovered by nonFederal auditors be reported to the Federal agency requiring the audit and to OIG for appropriate
action. For this reason, no revisions were made in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1773.6(a)(2) states that ``The borrower and CPA acknowledge that REA regulations provide that if the borrower
fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with GAGAS and this part, the borrower is in violation
of its security instrument with REA''. This language exceeds the applicable mortgage covenant and the following
language should be substituted: ``The borrower and CPA acknowledge that REA will consider the borrower to be in violation
of its security instrument with REA if the borrower fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAGAS and 7 CFR part 1773. This acknowledgement shall not be considered a contractual admission against interest
by either the borrower or the CPA.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 REA's proposed rule published on September 23, 1993, did not include revisions to &sect;1773.6(a)(2). Therefore,
comments on this section went beyond the scope of the proposal. REA is planning a separate rulemaking procedures that
will include changes in &sect;1773.6(a)(2) and REA will be soliciting comments at that time.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain disclosure and reporting requirements contained in &sect;1773.34 should include some consideration of
materiality. The concept of materiality is inherent in all audits. Strict compliance with the existing policy has,
however, resulted in reporting of immaterial items of non-compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.  
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously discussed, REA recognizes that certain procedures set forth in part 1773 exceed the requirements of
a GAGAS audit and REA has acknowledged that fact in the rule. Section 1773.34 sets forth REA's requirement that the
CPA must prepare a management letter and establishes the testing and reporting requirements for the management letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1773.34(e) sets forth certain provisions of REA's security instrument that REA has determined are essential
to the security of its loans. CPAs auditing REA borrowers are, therefore, required to test for compliance with the
security instrument provisions set forth in &sect;1773.34. Because of the degree of reliance that REA places on the
CPAs' testing in these areas, REA has determined that materiality should not be a factor upon which testing is based.
REA has, however, through the publication of this final rule, revised and eliminated many of the unclear or burdensome
requirements set forth in part 1773. For this reason, no additional revisions were made to &sect;1773.34.

We have audited the financial statements of [

Name of Borrower
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
] for the year ended December 31, 19x5, and have issued our report thereon dated March 15, 19x6. We conducted our audit
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States, and 7 CFR part 1773, Policy on Audits of Rural Electrification Administration (REA)
Borrowers. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Name of Borrower
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
] for the year ended December 31, 19x5, we considered its internal control structure in order to determine our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial statements and not to provide assurance on the
internal control structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining the internal control structure
and the objectives of and inherent limitations in such a structure is set forth in our independent auditors' report
on the internal control structure dated March 15, 19x6, and should be read in conjunction with this report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our consideration of the internal control structure would not necessarily disclose all matters in the internal control
structure that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A material weakness is a condition in which the design or operation of the specific internal control structure elements
does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or irregularities in amounts that would be material in
relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. However, we noted no matters involving the internal
control structure and its operation that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above. [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
If a material weakness was noted, refer the reader to the independent auditors' report on internal control structure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 1773.34 requires comments on specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance with specific
REA loan and security instrument provisions, and other additional matters. We have grouped our comments accordingly.
In addition to obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements,
at your request, we performed tests of specific aspects of the internal control structure, of compliance with specific
REA loan and security instrument provisions, and of additional matters. The specific aspects of the internal control
structure, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, and additional matters tested
include, among other things, the accounting procedures and records, materials control, compliance with specific
REA loan and security instrument provisions set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 (e)(1), [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
for telephone borrowers, 7 CFR 1773.34 (e)(2)], 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
related party transactions, and depreciation rates. [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For electric borrowers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
:] The additional matters tested also include a schedule of deferred debits and credits, upon which we express an opinion.
In addition, our audit of the financial statements also included the procedures specified in 7 CFR 1773.38&hyph;.45.
Our objective was not to provide an opinion on these specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance
with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, or additional matters, and accordingly, we express no
opinion thereon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No reports (other than our independent auditors' report, our independent auditors' compliance report, and our independent
auditors' report on the internal control structure, all dated March 15, 19x6) or summary of recommendations related
to our audit have been furnished to management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reflect an administrative change in the procedure
for notifying licensees of changes in the user fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for processing
fingerprint cards as part of the criminal history checks that nuclear power reactor licensees are required to perform
for those individuals granted unescorted access to an operating nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards Information.
This notice also informs licensees of the new user fee adopted by the FBI effective January 3, 1994.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of 10 CFR 73.57 requires licensees to process fingerprint cards through the NRC to the FBI Criminal
Justice Information Services Division which then does a criminal history check. A user fee for processing fingerprint
cards was required by Congress (Pub. L. 99&hyph;399), is established by the FBI, and is periodically increased as
the FBI's processing costs change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1993, the FBI's Division of Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) notified the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission that the ``user fee'' charged by the FBI for processing fingerprint cards had been increased from $23.00
to $24.00 effective January 3, 1994. The FBI user fee includes a $2.00 handling cost for the agency doing the initial
screening of the fingerprint cards, and provides that the agency doing the initial screening retains that handling
cost. In the case of nuclear reactor licensees, the NRC performs this initial screening. The user fee is periodically
changed by the FBI, as their processing costs change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this amendment pertains only to a user-fee change imposed by the FBI, the Commission for good cause finds that
the notice and public procedure provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are impractical and unnecessary.
Comment will not serve to alter the FBI fee, which is outside the control of the NRC. Further, rather than engaging in
an unnecessary rulemaking procedure to amend the rule every time the FBI changes the fee, this amendment removes the
fee amount from the rule. The Commission will advise licensees directly when the FBI fee changes. A notice of the FBI
fee change pertaining to NRC licensees will also be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.

Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described as a categorical exclusion in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under approval number 3150&hyph;0002.

Backfit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to the action taken in this final rulemaking
and, therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule because this amendment does not involve
any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

Airspace Docket 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;17, published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54953), changed the effective hours of
certain Class D Airspace areas from full time to part time. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport was inadvertently
included in the list of Class D Airspace areas in error. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport is Class E2 airspace,
an airspace area designated as a surface area for an airport. Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASO&hyph;18, published
on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54954), changed the effective hours of certain Class E airspace areas from full time to part
time. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport was inadvertently omitted from the list of Class E airspace areas. This
action corrects the errors by changing the designation of the Columbus Golden Triangle, MS Airspace area from Class
D to Class E.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is today issuing a final rule which amends the implementing
regulations for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). A number of the revisions are required by the American Technology
Preeminence Act of 1992, including provisions on: participation by foreign companies in ATP; the establishment
of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act; and a new requirement that
``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led. Further, requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP
recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed by the Act, and are thus
removed from the regulations. Similarly, ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations
has been repealed. Also, changes not required by the Act are made, including changes to simplify and clarify the selection
criteria, and to streamline the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology is today issuing a final rule which amends regulations found at
part 295 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which implement the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The
Advanced Technology Program assists United States businesses to carry out high-risk research and development that
will, if successful, improve the competitive position of the United States and its businesses by accelerating the
development of technologies that have significant potential to stimulate economic growth, and raise productivity.
ATP enters into cooperative agreements with United States joint research and development ventures and United States
businesses, especially small businesses. Where appropriate, Federal laboratories may be involved in ATP projects
consistent with other authority, such as cooperative research and development agreements under section 12 of the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980.

Description of the Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to part 295 include revisions on the following topics (please see the analysis of comments below for additional
details):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The eligibility of foreign firms to participate in ATP is addressed in a new section 295.3 of the regulations,
and a related definition of ``United States owned company'' is added in section 295.2(r). These revisions follow
the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(9)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;517, as amended) is set out at section 295.8(a). These revisions follow the requirements of section
201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)). That statute requires that
title to inventions made in whole or part with Program funds reside with for-profit companies that have been incorporated
in the United States. Entities that are not for-profit organizations incorporated in this country are not eligible
to obtain title to inventions made under the Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led, set out at &sect;&sect;295.2(i)
and 295.21, and the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations, set
out at &sect;295.30. These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively,
of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under
ATP have been repealed, and are thus removed from existing &sect;295.7(c) of the regulations. This revision follows
the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Finally, changes not required by the Act are made to the selection criteria, and to the internal operations
of ATP, including the selection process. These changes particularly include revisions to the remaining definitions
in &sect;295.2, changes to the selection process described in &sect;&sect;295.4 and 295.5, changes to the selection
criteria as set out in &sect;295.6, and changes to program administration found in &sect;&sect;295.7 and 295.14.

Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 2, 1993, the Technology Administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 41069). In response to this notice forty-four letters were received; twenty-nine from universities, ten from
other not-for-profit research organizations and industry associations, one from a state agency, one from a U.S.-owned
for-profit company, one from a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned corporation, one from a member of the U.S. House
of Representatives, and one from a member of the NIST staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All but four of the forty-four respondents, including all twenty-nine from universities and all ten from other not-for-profit
organizations, commented on the proposed revision to the treatment of patent rights found in &sect;295.8. An additional
two dozen comments were received concerning proposed changes to the proposed definitions set out in &sect;295.2.
The remaining comments were scattered among several sections, including: five concerning new &sect;295.14, which
deals with special financial reporting requirements; three on the revisions to the selection criteria found in &sect;295.5;
two on the use of abbreviated proposals proposed in &sect;295.5; and one each on the provisions on the eligibility
and qualification of applicants found in &sect;&sect;295.3 and 295.31. No comments were received in response to
proposed changes to the following: &sect;295.1, pertaining to the purpose of the regulation; &sect;295.4, the selection
process; &sect;295.7, pertaining to notices of availability of funds; &sect;295.21, on qualification of applicants;
&sect;295.22, dealing with limitations on assistance; &sect;295.24, concerning registration under the antitrust
laws; and &sect;295.30, which describes the types of assistance available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a section-by-section description of the comments received by NIST, and NIST's response to those
comments.

Section 295.2&blank;Definitions_Comment Summary (24 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-three respondents, all universities or other nonprofit organizations, questioned whether the definition
of ``United States-owned company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule reflected the actual intent of Congress
as stated in the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. The definition of United States-owned company set out
in &sect;295.2(r) is used in section 295.8 to determine eligibility to obtain title to inventions arising from assistance
under ATP. A consolidated analysis of the issues raised by &sect;295.2(r) and 295.8 is presented in the discussion
of &sect;295.8 later in this notice, and the reader is asked to refer to that discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the issue described above, one respondent questioned the exclusion (by omission) of independent research
and development (IR&amp;D) costs in the definition of matching funds found in &sect;295.2(1). IR&amp;D funds are
generally generated through contracts funded by the federal government. The financial assistance regulations
which are applicable to ATP awards, and particularly Attachment E to OMB Circular A&hyph;110, prohibit the use of
federal funds as cost share or match unless specifically authorized by federal law. The rule follows closely the wording
of the 1988 legislation and hence cannot be changed without congressional action. The purpose of the limitations
on qualified matching funds is to obtain a meaningful and significant commitment of company resources towards ATP
objectives, including support to additional R&amp;D beyond that which would have occurred without the ATP award.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned company requested that both eligibility requirements and cancellation requirements
for foreign-owned applicants be made clearer and that they be consistent with present law and with H.R. 820. In response,
NIST notes that H.R. 820 is not law, but rather is pending legislation in the Congress. NIST cannot base changes in rules
upon proposed legislation that has not been enacted.

Section 295.5&blank;Use of Abbreviated Proposals in the Selection Process_(2 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents endorsed the use of abbreviated proposals. One respondent further proposed that abbreviated proposals
address, and thus be evaluated on, scientific and technical criteria only. NIST has determined that business and
economic factors are important factors in assessing the potential for success of a proposed project, and therefore
must be considered in addition to the scientific and technical merit of the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents endorsed the increased emphasis on ``scientific and technical merit'', one of whom suggested increasing
its weight further to 40 percent. Another respondent took issue with the reduced weight for two proposers ``level
of commitment'' and suggested increasing the weight for the ``commitment'' criteria to 30 percent by eliminating
``experience and qualifications'' as a separate criteria.

In response to these comments, &sect;295.5 has been modified to increase the weight of the ``level of commitment''
to 20 percent, the level that exists in the regulation as it was promulgated in 1990. The weight given ``experience
and qualifications'' has been reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent.

Section 295.8(a)&blank;Patent Rights_(40 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty comments were received concerning the proposed revision to &sect;295.8(a)(1), thirty-nine from universities
and other nonprofit organizations opposed to the proposal, and one from a business supporting the proposal. Also,
twenty-three of the thirty-nine commentors described above objected to the definition of ``United States-owned
company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``United States-owned company'' defined in &sect;295.2(r) is used in &sect;295.8(a)(1) to determine who
is eligible to obtain title inventions arising from assistance under ATP. The definition states that an entity must
be organized for profit-making purposes to be deemed a United States-owned company, and &sect;295.8(a)(1) states
that only United States-owned companies may take title to inventions arising under the ATP. Taken together, the two
sections prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from obtaining title to inventions arising under
the ATP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The thirty-nine universities and nonprofit commentors are strongly opposed to this outcome. The following objection
is typical: ``The ATP legislation enables universities to participate in research funded through the program, and
(we have) taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. However, the problem is that NIST has interpreted the ATP legislation
to exclude universities from ownership of intellectual property resulting from ATP funded research.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the view of NIST, the decision to prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from taking title to inventions
is embedded in statute, and NIST has no alternative but to follow the law as it presently is written. As a result of comments
received from both for-profit and nonprofit organizations, NIST recognizes that one ingredient for the successful
implementation of joint ventures under ATP is a flexible patent policy. The participants in ATP joint ventures need
the flexibility to determine for themselves the best means of commercializing the technology they develop. This,
in turn, requires the flexibility to allocate intellectual property rights as the joint ventures best see fit. Accordingly,
NIST is working with the Congress in an attempt to enact a patent policy for ATP that leaves the decisions on patent ownership
to joint venture members. Should a change in the law be enacted, NIST would immediately implement it. In that case,
NIST would rely on the ATP proposal evaluation criteria to assess the probability of subsequent commercialization
based on the proposed intellectual property rights arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)) states that intellectual
property rights developed under ATP ``shall vest in a company or companies incorporated in the United States.'' In
reaching the conclusion that the term ``company or companies'' refers to profit-making entities, NIST has been guided
by the broader context of changes made to the ATP by the American Technology Preeminence Act. NIST believes that it
was the intent of Congress to provide title to inventions directly to U.S. companies as the most effective means of
assuring that research results enter the marketplace rapidly, and in the way most beneficial to United States businesses.
In this context, NIST notes that the Act contains a new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures''
funded by ATP must be industry-led. NIST also notes the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to nonprofit
independent research organizations. (See sections 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American
Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, NIST believes that the only reasonable reading of section 201(c)(6) is to interpret the term ``United States-owned
company'' as referring to businesses, and specifically, to for-profit entities.

Section 295.8 (b) and (c)&blank;Copyright and Publication_(24 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of universities have expressed fear that the new ATP rules will prevent universities or their employees from
copyrighting their works. The fear is also raised that the ATP rule will require universities to get the permission
of their for-profit collaborators before publishing their research findings. In response, NIST notes that the parts
of the ATP rule dealing with the questions raised by these comments on copyright and publication were not proposed
to be substantively changed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of August 2, 1993. In the old rule, the provision on copyright was found in &sect;295.5(b), and the treatment
of publication of research results was found at &sect;295.8(d). In the new rule, the provision on copyright is found
in &sect;295.8(b), and the treatment of publication of research results is at &sect;295.8(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old &sect;295.5(b) concerned the governmental
use license that each ATP funding recipient is required to provide to NIST for any copyrighted data first produced
in the performance of the ATP award. The scope of the governmental use license has been truncated by deleting the authority
of the government to distribute computer programs first produced in the performance of the ATP award to users in the
United States. The ability of funding recipients to copyright the works of their employees remains unchanged. Both
the old and new versions of the ATP regulation state that ``funding recipients'' can copyright works made under ATP.
Universities that receive funds under ATP are ``funding recipients''. They are funding recipients if they are members
of joint ventures. They are funding recipients if they are subcontractors. Universities get copyright. Accordingly,
no change is made to &sect;295.8(c) of the regulation based upon the comments described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old &sect;295.5(d) was to delete the first part
of the first sentence. That sentence originally read: ``Although the program will encourage the timely publication
of research results by funding recipients, the decision on whether to publish or not will be made by the funding recipient(s).''
In the proposed revision, the sentence was revised to read simply ``The decision on whether to publish or not will be
made by the funding recipient(s).'' NIST believes that the regulation is very clear that the decision to publish shall
be made by negotiated agreement of the funding recipients and that the for-profit members of a joint venture will not
be able to dictate to universities on this matter. This provision has been part of every ATP award made since 1990, and
no difficulties have arisen under it. Accordingly, no change is made to section 295.8(c) of the proposed regulation
based upon the comments described above.

Section 295.14&blank;Special Financial Reporting_(5 Comments)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two universities and three other not-for-profit organizations commented on proposed section 295.14, which would
increase the flexibility of financial reporting requirements and encourage award recipients to retain independent
CPA firms to perform audit services, while reserving the right of the Department of Commerce's Office of the Inspector
General to determine the timing and nature of these services, and to conduct its own audit. The comments suggested
a need for greater specificity as to the applicable OMB regulations which might apply and the conditions under which
the Departmental Inspector General would exercise his authority in setting the time frame and scope of audit services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the regulations have been amended to state that the audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing
Standards'' subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''.
Clarifying changes have also been made to the definitions of ``direct costs'' found at &sect;295.2(c) and ``indirect
costs'' found at &sect;295.2(h).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent urged that state and local governments and U.S. universities and non-profit research institutes
working independently should be eligible to receive individual ATP awards outside of joint ventures. No change has
been made to the regulation based upon this comment because eligibility for individual awards is expressly limited
to United States companies by section 278n(b)(2) of title 15 of the United States Code.

This final rule relating to grants, benefits, and contracts is exempt from the delayed effective date requirement,
and accordingly, under section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), is therefore being
made effective immediately without a 30 day delay in effective date.

This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel
certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, at the time this rule was proposed that,
if it were adopted as proposed it would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This is because there are only a small number
of awardees and thus only a small number of awards will be given to small businesses. The program is entirely voluntary
for the participants that seek funding. It is not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under
the National Environment Policy Act. This rule contains collection of information requirements subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act approved by OMB under control number 0693&hyph;0009. The Advanced Technology Program does not involve
the mandatory payment of any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state
or local government. Accordingly, the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not
applicable to this program. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant
preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The purpose of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) is to assist United States businesses to carry out research
and development on pre-competitive generic technologies. These technologies are: (1) Enabling, because they offer
wide breadth of potential application and form an important technical basis for future commercial applications;
and (2) high value, because when applied, they offer significant benefits to the U.S. economy. Precompetitive technology
is defined in &sect;295.2(n) and generic technology is defined in &sect;295.2(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of joint research and development ventures involving potential competitors, the willingness of firms
to commit significant amounts of corporate resources to the venture is evidence that the proposed research and development
is precompetitive. For joint ventures that involve firms and their customers or suppliers or for single firms not
proposing cooperative research and development, a quantified description of the expected broad applicability
of the technology and adequate assurances that the technology being developed will be utilized widely can provide
evidence that the proposed research and development is pre-competitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) These rules prescribe policies and procedures for the award of cooperative agreements under the advanced Technology
Program in order to ensure the fair treatment of all proposals. While the Advanced Technology Program is authorized
to enter into grants, competitive agreements, and contracts to carry out its mission, these rules address only the
award of cooperative agreements. The Program employs cooperative agreements rather than grants because such agreements
allow ATP to exercise appropriate management oversight of projects and also to link ATP-funded projects to ongoing
R&amp;D at the National Institute of Standards and Technology wherever such linkage would increase the likelihood
of success of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 295.2 is amended by revising paragraph (a), redesignating paragraphs (d) through (i) as paragraphs (k)

method used by the applicant for that equipment prior to the award. The value of equipment will be further pro-rated
according to the share of total use dedicated to carrying out the proposed ATP work program. The total value of equipment
expenditures allowable under the match may be applied in the award year expended or pro-rated over the duration of
award years. The total in-kind value of equipment expenditures can not exceed 30% of the applicant's total annual
share of matching funds. The total in-kind value of part-time personnel can not exceed 20% of the applicant's total

(a) A company shall be eligible to receive an award from the Program only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Program finds that the company's participation in the Program would be in the economic interest of the United
States, as evidenced by investments in the United States in research, development, and manufacturing (including,
for example, the manufacture of major components or subassemblies in the United States); significant contributions
to employment in the United States; and agreement with respect to any technology arising from assistance provided
by the Program to promote the manufacture within the United States of products resulting from that technology (taking
into account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States industry), and to procure parts and materials
from competitive suppliers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Either the company is a United States-owned company, or the Program finds that the company is incorporated in the
United States and has a parent company which is incorporated in a country which affords to United States-owned companies
opportunities, comparable to those afforded to any other company, to participate in any joint venture similar to
those authorized under the Program; affords the United States-owned companies local investment opportunities
comparable to those afforded to any other company; and affords adequate and effective protection for the intellectual
property rights of United States-owned companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Program may, within 30 days after notice to Congress, suspend a company or joint venture from continued assistance
under the Program if the Program determines that the company, the country of incorporation of the company or a parent
company, or the joint venture has failed to satisfy any of the criteria contained in paragraph (a) of this section,
and that it is in the national interest of the United States to do so.

 The selection process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The selection process for awards is a multi-step process based on the criteria listed in &sect;295.6. In the first
step, called ``preliminary screening,'' proposals are eliminated that do not meet the requirements of this rule
or the program announcement. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for eliminating a proposal at this stage is that
the proposal: is deemed to have serious deficiencies in either the technical or business plan; or does not meet the
definition of precompetitive, generic technology; or, is not industry-led; or is significantly overpriced or underpriced
given the scope of the work; or does not meet the requirements set out in the Notice of Availability of Funds issued pursuant
to &sect;295.7; or in the case of joint ventures, requests more than a minority share of funding. NIST will also examine
proposals that have been submitted to a previous competition to determine whether substantive revisions have been
made to the earlier proposal, and if not, may reject the proposal or forward it to a later stage in the review process
based upon the earlier review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the second step, referred to as the ``technical and business review,'' proposals are evaluated under the criteria
found in &sect;295.6. Proposals are rated as ``not recommended'' or ``recommended.'' Proposals must have high scientific
and technical merit to be recommended. Only those proposals rated as ``recommended'' are considered further. These
applicants are referred to as ``semifinalists.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In the third step, referred to as ``selection of finalists,'' the Program prepares a final scoring and ranking
of semifinalist proposals. During this step, the semifinalist proposers may be asked to make oral presentations
on their proposals at NIST, and in some cases site visits may be required. Subject to the provisions of &sect;295.6,
a list of ranked finalists is submitted to the selecting official.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) In the final step, referred to as ``selection of awardees,'' the Selecting Official selects funding recipients
from among the finalists, based upon (1) the rank order of the applications on the basis of all selection criteria (&sect;295.6);
(2) assuring an appropriate distribution of funds among technologies and activities, and (3) the availability of
funds. The Program reserves the right to withhold awards in any case where a search of Federal records discloses information
that raises a reasonable doubt as to the responsibility of the applicant. The decision of the Selecting Official is
final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If a joint venture is ranked as a finalist, but the Program determines that the joint venture contains weaknesses
in its structure or cohesiveness that may substantially lessen the probability of the proposed program being completed
successfully, the Program may inform the applicant of the deficiencies and enter into negotiations with the applicant
in an effort to remedy the deficiencies. If appropriate, funding up to 10 percent of the amount originally requested
by the applicant may be awarded by the Program to the applicant to assist in overcoming the organizational deficiencies.
If the Program determines within six months of this award that the organizational deficiencies have been corrected,
the Program may award the remaining funds requested by the applicant to that applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) NIST reserves the right to negotiate with applicants selected to receive awards the cost and scope of the proposed
work, e.g., to add or delete a task to improve the probability of success.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce proposal preparation costs incurred by applicants and to make the selection process more efficient, NIST
may use a preliminary qualification process based on abbreviated proposals. Announcements requesting abbreviated
proposals will be published as indicated in &sect;295.7, seeking proposals that address all of the selection criteria,
but in considerably less detail than full proposals. The Program will review the abbreviated proposals and select
those that best meet the selection criteria. Submitters of abbreviated proposals will be notified in writing whether
their proposals are recommended for full proposal, or, not recommended for full proposal. Those whose proposals
are recommended for full proposal submission will be invited to prepare and submit full proposals. Those not invited
to submit proposals may nonetheless elect to do so, and will have an equal opportunity for selection. When the full
proposals are received, the review and selection process will continue as described in &sect;295.4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Appropriateness of the technical risk and feasibility of the project; that is, is there a sufficient knowledge

toward commercial application, either through their own organization(s) or through others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Degree to which proposal identifies potential applications of the technology and provides evidence that the
applicant has credible plans to assure prompt and widespread use of the technology if the R&amp;D is successful and
to ensure adequate protection of the intellectual property by the participant(s) and, as appropriate, by other U.S.
businesses.

Extent to which the proposer assigns the company's best people to the project. Priority given to this work vis-a-vis
other projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For joint ventures, the extent to which the joint venture has been structured (vertical integration, horizontal
integration, or both) so as to include sufficient participants possessing all of the skills required to complete
successfully the proposed work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For joint ventures, appropriate participation by small businesses. ``Small business'' is defined in &sect;295.2(q).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Appropriateness of subcontractor/supplier/collaborator participation and relationships (where applicable).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Clarity and appropriateness of management plan. Extent to which the proposers have clarified who is responsible
for each task, and the chain of command. Extent to which those responsible for the work have adequate authority and
access to higher level management.

(2) Quality and appropriateness of the technical staff to carry out the proposed work program and to identify and overcome
barriers to meeting project objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Past performance of the company or joint venture members in carrying out similar kinds of efforts successfully,
including technology application. Consideration of this factor in the case of a start-up company or new joint venture,
will take into account the past performance of the key people in carrying out similar kinds of efforts.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 31_``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures'', or other sound accounting
practices to be specified in the Cooperative Agreement. The audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing Standards''
subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''. Each award
will be subject to an Attestation Engagement (i.e., providing assurance on representations of compliance with statutory,
regulatory, and contractual requirements) or an audit in conjunction with the recipient's annual audit at least
every two years. In the interest of efficiency, the recipients are encouraged to retain their own independent CPA
firm to perform these services. The Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reserves the right
to determine the time frame and/or level of service of financial audit reports that are to be delivered and to determine
how the close-out audit is to be conducted. The use of an independent CPA firm does not preclude the OIG's right to conduct
its own audit.

We are extending the date on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings, found in appendix 1 of part 404,
subpart P, will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994. We have made no revisions in the medical
criteria in the cardiovascular system listings; they remain the same as they now appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.
We are presently considering comments we received on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to update the medical
criteria contained in part A and part B of the cardiovascular system listings. When we have completed our review, any
revised criteria will be published as final regulations.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1985, a revised Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 50068). The Listing of Impairments describes, for each of 13 major body systems, impairments that are considered
severe enough to preclude a person from engaging in any gainful activity (part A), or in the case of a child under the
age of 18, impairments that are considered severe enough to prevent the child from functioning independently, appropriately,
and effectively in an age-appropriate manner (part B). The Listing of Impairments is used for evaluating disability
and blindness at the third step of the sequential evaluation process for adults and children under the Social Security
disability program and the supplemental security income program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the revised Listing of Impairments was published in 1985, we indicated that medical advances in disability evaluation
and treatment and program experience would require that the listings be periodically reviewed and updated. Accordingly,
we established termination dates ranging from 4 to 8 years for each of the listings for specific body systems. A date
of December 6, 1989, was established for the cardiovascular system listings in part A to no longer be effective. A date
of December 6, 1993, was established for part B of the cardiovascular system listings to no longer be effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential program impact of the changes to update the cardiovascular system listings required careful analysis
and consideration within the Agency. As our analysis continued, it became evident that we would be unable to publish
a proposed and then a final regulation containing revised criteria for part A of the cardiovascular system listings
by December 6, 1989. We published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 5, 1989 (54 FR 50233), a final regulation extending the current part A cardiovascular system listings
for a period of 18 months through June 5, 1991. The part A cardiovascular system listings were again extended an additional
12 months through June 5, 1992, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 6, 1991 (56 FR 26030), and were extended to January 5, 1993, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 5, 1992 (57 FR 23945), and to July 6, 1993, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 61795). The part A and part B cardiovascular system listings were extended to January 6,
1994, by final regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 9, 1991, we published an NPRM proposing revisions to the medical criteria contained in parts A and B of the cardiovascular
system listings (56 FR 31266), with provisions for a 60-day comment period. The complex issues raised by the numerous
comments we received have required extensive analysis and careful consideration. In order to ensure sufficient
time for this review, we are extending the date on which the current cardiovascular system listings in parts A and B
will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy, generally follows the Administrative Procedure
Act notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its
regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures
when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists
for waiver of notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures on this rule because it only extends the
dates on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings will no longer be effective and makes no substantive
changes to these listings. The current regulations expressly provide that the listings may be extended by the Secretary,
as well as revised and promulgated again. Because we are not making any revisions to the current listings, we have determined
that use of public comment procedures is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final rule to temporarily
place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to
the emergency scheduling provisions of the CSA. This action is based on the finding by the Acting Administrator of
the DEA that the placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid
an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this rule, the criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of
Schedule I substances under the CSA will be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;473) amended section 201 of the Controlled Substances
Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 811) to give the Attorney General the authority to temporarily place a substance into Schedule
I of the CSA if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. A substance
may be temporarily scheduled under the emergency provision of the CSA if that substance is not listed in any other schedule
under Section 202 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 812) of if there is no approval or exemption in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the substance. The Attorney General has delegated his authority under 21 U.S.C. 811
to the Administrator of the DEA (28 CFR 0.100).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of intent to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 4, 1993, (58 FR 58819). The Administrator transmitted notice of his intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
into Schedule I of the CSA to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
In response to this notification, the Food and Drug Administration has advised DEA that there are no exemptions or
approvals in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
and HHS has no objection to DEA's intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule
I of the CSA. No other comments were received regarding this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3), the Acting Administrator has considered the following factors regarding
4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine: (1) Its history and current pattern of abuse; (2) scope, duration and significance
of abuse; and (3) what, if any, risk there is to the public health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens,
4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (STP or DOM) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (DOB). Like DOM and
DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable
of substituting for either DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from
human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is orally active at 0.1&hyph;0.2 mg/kg producing
an intoxication with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have
been reported to produce intense and frightening hallucinations.

DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Texas in 1979. Since that time, several other exhibits
of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine have been analyzed by DEA and state forensic laboratories in California,
Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Oregon, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. Clandestine laboratories producing
4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine were seized in California in 1986 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented
as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. More recently, it has been
promoted as an aphrodisiac and distributed under the product name of NEXUS whose purported active ingredient is brominated
cathinine. DEA has recently seized several thousand dosage units of this product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The continued clandestine production, illicit importation, distribution and abuse of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
poses an imminent hazard to public safety. DEA is not aware of any commercial use for this substance in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of section 201(h) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)) and 28 CFR 0.100 and based on a consideration
of the requisite factors and other relevant information, the Acting Administrator finds that placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
into Schedule I of the CSA on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following regulations are effective with respect to 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine on January 6, 1994,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Acting Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
into Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This action involves the temporary control of a substance with no currently approved medical use in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is not a significant regulatory action for the
purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the provisions of E.O. 12866, section 3(d)(1). Accordingly,
this proposed emergency scheduling action is not subject to provisions of E.O. 12778 which are contingent upon review
by OMB. This regulation both responds to an emergency situation posing an imminent hazard to the public safety, and
is essential to a criminal law enforcement function of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined
that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Regulatory History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the sponsor's late submission of the regatta application
left insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in advance of the scheduled event. However, the
Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now as the benefits of holding the training
during the winter, as scheduled, rather than later in the spring will mean less impact on the boating public.

Background and Purposes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation Anzio Reenactment consists of river crossing training for the 19th Engineer Battalion, Fort Knox, Kentucky.
The Training will take place over three days, January 20&hyph;22, 1994. Each day's training will begin at 12 p.m.,
and will end at 3 p.m. local time. In order to provide for the safety of spectators and participants, and for the safe
passage of through traffic, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regatta area. The river will be closed
during part or all of the effective period to all vessel traffic except participants, official regatta vessels, and
patrol craft. These regulations are issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 and 33 CFR 100.35.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact
of this regulation to be minimal due to its short duration.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures
would have been contrary to the public interest. Immediate action is needed to prevent possible loss of life and damage
to vessels in the area and to the structure itself. Although this regulation is published as a final rule without prior
notice, an opportunity for public comment is nevertheless desirable to ensure that the regulation is both reasonable
and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The circumstances creating the need for this regulation is information received by Chevron and by the Coast Guard
that vessels intend to protest and possibly interfere with drilling operations at this site. This is the first site
at which drilling will begin in this particular area, which has been a subject of controversy. Precautionary measures
for safety at a drilling site require that the structure and waters around it be maintained free of interference and
traffic in order to allow for immediate evacuation of personnel aboard the structure and by attending vessels in case
of emergency. The establishment of a safety zone will prevent non-attending vessels from remaining in close proximity
to the offshore structure and hindering any necessary evacuation of the area.

This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant
under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic
impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The Coast Guard certifies
that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to control
vessel traffic in the regulated area to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area.
The regulation will prohibit navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection
of life and property associated with bridge and span removal.

Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the nature of repairs to the Burlington Highway Bridge
at mile 404.2 Upper Mississippi River leaves insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rule making. The Coast
Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period since the
conditions present an immediate hazard.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Extensive renovation of the bridge is required and removal of the center is to be accomplished from a vessel located
in the navigation channel and this action will impede normal traffic flow. As a result of these conditions this regulation
is necessary to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
The imposed restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact
on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri will monitor the
situation and will authorized entry into the closed area as conditions warrant. Changes will be announced by Marine
Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners may also call the Port
Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current information.

Regulatory History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a bridge is being removed from a navigable waterway. Bridge
removal operations pose inherent risks to the waterway because the structure is progressively weakened as the operation
proceeds. Once commenced, such operations should be completed as quickly as possible. Removal operations involving
structural supports for this bridge have proceeded ahead of schedule, leaving insufficient time to publish a notice
of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting
for a comment period, as immediate implementation of navigation restrictions is needed to ensure the safety of vessels
transitting the area and to minimize the time a bridge in a weakened condition remains over the waterway.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Port Vue Bridge located at mile 1.3 on the Youghiogheny River is not longer an active highway bridge and must be removed.
The bridge consists of several small spans that are located over land and one 310-foot main span that crosses over the
navigable waterway. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, this main span will be demolished with five simultaneously
detonated explosive charges. This explosion, which will create an obvious hazard to vessels transitting the area,
will occur at approximately 10 a.m. on January 8, 1994. After the explosives on this span are detonated, the steel and
other debris from the bridge will fall into the navigable waters of the Youghiogheny River, creating an unsafe condition
of vessels. The contractor will immediately commence clearing operations, but it will require 48 hours to restore
the navigability of this section of the Youghiogheny River. Accordingly, during that period, no traffic will be permitted
in the safety zone, as it would be unsafe for vessels attempting to transit and such transit attempts would interfere
with the debris clearing operations.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact
of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively
small size of the area regulated, and the absence of any commercial vessel transits along this section of the Youghiogheny
River, due to insufficient bridge clearances and water depth downriver.

Federalism Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
as an action required to protect public safety.

The regulations that appear at 38 CFR 4.87a, diagnostic code 6210, establish the criteria for evaluating disease
of the auditory canal. Due to VA error, that criteria contains the word ``serious'' instead of the word ``serous.''

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today promulgating changes to its fuel economy calculation regulations to conform to changes in the Motor Vehicle
Information &amp; Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2), made by section 371 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (NAFTA Implementation Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182 (December 8, 1993).
Section 104(a)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act specifically provides that ``appropriate officers of the United
States Government may issue such regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may be necessary to ensure that any *&blank;*&blank;*
amendment made by this Act, that takes effect on the date the Agreement enters into force is appropriately implemented
on such date.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MVICSA, 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(1), specifies that the EPA Administrator is to separate passenger automobiles manufactured
by a manufacturer into foreign and domestic fleets, and to calculate the average fuel economy of each category separately.
Prior to the NAFTA Implementation Act, 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) specified that an automobile is to be considered domestically
manufactured in any model year if at least 75% of the cost to the manufacturer is attributable to value added in the United
States or Canada, unless the assembly is completed in Canada and the automobile is not imported into the United States
prior to the expiration of 30 days following the end of the model year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 371 of the NAFTA Implementation Act simply adds a new subparagraph (G) to 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) extending domestic
treatment to costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added in Mexico, according to an explicit phase-in schedule.
The statutory change does not alter the current treatment of costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added
in the United States or Canada. Pursuant to clause (iii) in new subparagraph (G), the Secretary of Transportation
is to prescribe reasonable procedures for manufacturers to make elections for the phase-in schedules described
in today's regulations, and the EPA Administrator may prescribe rules for carrying out subparagraph (G). Today,
EPA is amending its regulations governing the determination of domestic production to include the provisions of
new subparagraph (G) in 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2).

II. Environmental Effects and Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the NAFTA Implementation Act does not give EPA discretion as to the content of these regulations and because
Congress required the regulations to become effective less than a month after enactment of this Act, the Agency has
not conducted detailed analyses of the environmental and economic impacts separate from the analyses that were done
on the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Public Participation and Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Agency is not using notice and comment
rulemaking procedures to promulgate this rule because the Agency has found that notice is unnecessary and impracticable.
Comment is unnecessary because the rule issued today merely conforms pre-existing regulations as required by the
NAFTA Implementation Act and does not involve an exercise of discretion by the Administrator. Furthermore, comment
is impracticable because the NAFTA Implementation Act allowed the Administrator less than one month between the
date of enactment and the date by which the regulations must be effective. It is impracticable to have notice-and-comment
rulemaking completed in such a short time. This short time period is consistent with EPA's view that it is performing
a ministerial act that is not subject to notice and comment rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule is being made effective sooner than 30 days after publication or service. This is permitted by section 553(d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act when the Agency finds good cause and publishes it with the rule. The Agency finds
that there is good cause. The regulation needs to be effective on January 1, 1994, to avoid having the statute (which
goes into effect on January 1, 1994) differ from the implementing regulations. In addition, the statutory provision
itself will go into effect less than 30 days after it was enacted, which precludes EPA from providing 30 days between
publication or service and the effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required and does not expect this change to be controversial,
as it directly incorporates the explicit provisions of the statutory amendment into the current regulations. Nonetheless,
EPA will accept comments on these regulatory changes and will consider making changes if justified by the comments.

IV. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority for the actions promulgated in this final rule is granted to EPA by section 371 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;182. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Administrative Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore,
subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines a ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1990, which requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts
of federal regulations upon small entities, does not apply to this rulemaking. Section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act requires analyses only for final rules for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. As discussed
in section III, a general notice of rulemaking would be unnecessary and impracticable and, thus, is not required for
this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA must obtain Office of Management and Budget clearance for any activity that will involve collecting substantially
the same information from ten or more non-Federal respondents. This regulation does not impose any new information
requirements or contain any new information collection requirements and will result in no change in the reporting
burden.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule issues technical amendments to Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations intended to simplify and improve our system for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers in the administration of the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, we evaluate intermediaries using performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards announced in an annual notice in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. We are clarifying the methodology for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing these criteria and standards. For consistency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we establish comparable regulation requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of carrier performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These revisions are published in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1816(f) and 1842(b)(2) of the Social Security Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which require us to develop standards, criteria, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to evaluate an intermediary's or carrier's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall performance.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act), public or private organizations and agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the administration of Part A (Hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insurance) of the Medicare program under agreements with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies or organizations are known as fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries, and they perform bill processing and benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment functions for the Medicare program. Under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1842(a) of the Act, the Secretary is authorized to enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into contracts with carriers to fulfill various functions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administration of Part B (Supplementary Medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insurance) of the Medicare program. Beneficiaries, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physicians and suppliers of the services submit claims to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these carriers that, in turn, make appropriate payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1980 for intermediaries and in 1981 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers, we have been evaluating the effectiveness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of contractor operations through a system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards called the Contractor Performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation Program (CPEP).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We refer to the performance requirements we use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the performance of intermediaries and carriers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting their contractual obligations to HCFA in our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and program instructions as criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. When we developed our regulations, criteria were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be distinguished from standards; we intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure broad categorizations of performance using criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(42 CFR 421.120) and to measure statistical and performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data using standards (&sect;421.122). As planned, a contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had to be evaluated by and pass the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria before we evaluated contractor performance using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical standards. However, in practice, the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been used to measure a contractor's compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the criteria. The separate reliance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical standards diminished and we have developed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPEP under which standards are used to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of specific activities in a defined criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead of ``statistical'' standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1992, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(57 FR 57125) a proposed rule describing technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions we proposed to make to Medicare regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to simplify and improve our system for evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performances of fiscal intermediaries and carriers in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the Medicare program. These technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions are necessary to bring our regulations up to date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with our actual use of criteria and standards in performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the proposed rule we described how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reliance on statistical standards diminished and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current ``standards'' are used to measure the performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific activities in a defined criterion. That is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement and evaluation using criteria and standards have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evolved into a one-step process. In addition, we noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain functions that were included in the original planned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation structure have been transferred to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate review activities. We, therefore, proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend &sect;&sect;421.3, 421.112(b), 421.118(b) and 421.122 to delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to statistical standards and to replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards for the areas evaluated formerly by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical standards with a general explanation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas evaluated by performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also mentioned in the proposed rule that our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not contain requirements relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of carrier performance that are parallel to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those for intermediaries. For consistency, we proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a new &sect;421.201, ``Performance Criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards,'' that would measure and evaluate carrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of functional responsibilities, such as, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate and timely processing of claims, responsiveness to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries', physicians' and suppliers' concerns, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper management of administrative funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to base performance criteria and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the experience of carriers nationwide, changes in carrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations due to fiscal constraints, and our objectives in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving better performance. Before the beginning of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPEP evaluation period, we would publish the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also announced that we would add a new &sect;421.203, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Carrier's failure to perform efficiently and effectively,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to explain the adverse action that may be taken by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary if the carrier fails to meet criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards specified at &sect;421.201. The content is parallel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to &sect;421.124, which applies to intermediaries. This new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;421.203 does not add or change carrier obligations. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely codifies in regulations a provision specific to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers that has been in effect since Public Law 98&hyph;369. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Analysis of and Response to Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received 10 timely items of correspondence in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to the December 3, 1992 proposed rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments were from intermediaries, carriers, contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocacy groups, and provider advocacy groups. A summary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments and the Department's responses follow: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be developed by HCFA for receiving comments, complaints, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems with carrier performance by physicians or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional organizations and that the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by this process be included in the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance evaluation of a carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning in Fiscal Year 1994, HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review both intermediaries' and carriers' efforts to enhance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customer satisfaction through the use of customer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction surveys, including the National Physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survey. Results of the surveys will be used to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance data on customer satisfaction and to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas in need of improvement. The results will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized for publication in the report of contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of the commenters believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain of our proposed changes at &sect;&sect;421.124 and 421.203 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unnecessary. Those changes would allow the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take adverse action if an intermediary or carrier exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount the Secretary finds to be reasonable and adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the costs which must be incurred by an efficiently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and economically operated intermediary or carrier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding whether the intermediary or carrier meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the published criteria and standards. Both the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and carrier contracts currently have a provision to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to request a committee of the contractors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist in efforts to effect improvements in the high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor's performance. In addition, the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractor Performance Evaluation Program (CPEP) contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures on contractor costs. If a contractor fails to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable criteria, its CPEP score is reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree that the proposed changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unnecessary. This section of the regulation would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize us to take adverse action for deficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of a function not specifically evaluated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPEP. Currently, CPEP only measures contractor performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in meeting the approved budget and the contractor's relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standing among similar contractors. Moreover, beginning in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FY 1993, CPEP eliminated the concept of passing/failing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall evaluation. Passing/failing now is determined on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard by standard basis. For example, if a contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fails to meet the approved budget, it will fail one standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CPEP, not the entire CPEP. Thus, despite CPEP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to take adverse contract action against high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries and carriers is necessary. As the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note, current contracts allow the Secretary to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee of the contractors to assist in efforts to effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in the high cost contractor's performance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulatory change allows us to take the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logical step in the event efforts to effect improvement have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed. We will have authority to take adverse action based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on continued high cost performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stressed that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;421.124 and &sect;421.203 were vague. They asked that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further define ``reasonable'' amount, and how and when high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost would be calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the provisions at &sect;421.124 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;421.203 are clear and straightforward. It is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to consider the funding levels that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable and adequate to meet the costs incurred by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently and economically operated contractor. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address this responsibility, we develop unit cost targets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each contractor prior to the start of every fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These unit cost targets are forwarded to the HCFA regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices as part of the Budget and Performance Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BPRs) package and represent the benchmark for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations between the regional offices and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the composition of a contractor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload (for example, number of hospital inpatient bills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus number of outpatient bills or laboratory bills, etc.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an important factor in the amount of costs it incurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since some claims are inherently more problematic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to resolve. In order to give full consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each contractor's unique situation, we currently apply a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``complexity index'' to develop the BPRs' unit cost targets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This methodology allows us to correlate the contractor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs with its individual workload composition. The use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complexity index allows us to identify the contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose unit costs appear to be out of proportion to the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and medium (electronic versus hardcopy) of workload they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the complexity index methodology allows us to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate each contractor's costs with full consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its unique workload mix and within the national forum of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peers. In this way, we identify our high cost contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since the use of the complexity index methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an administrative tool to identify contractors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aberrant costs and can be changed or modified as required, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we do not believe it necessary to outline this methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulation.

Several commenters stated that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;421.124(a) and 421.203(a) on high cost contractors do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the types of adverse action we may take on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds of excessive cost. Contractors are uncertain about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how we would go about the process of applying sanctions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what these sanctions might be.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adverse contract actions are listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;421.124(a) and 421.203(a) of the proposed regulation, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are not limited to those. Adverse contract actions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further defined in the intermediary and carrier manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuances released within the HCFA Program Manual Issuances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System, which contain the details of the CPEP. Adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions range in severity commensurate with relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance and include, but are not limited to, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions as, Regional Office Letter of Admonition; Central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office Letter of Admonition; deletion of the automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal clause from the contract without performance goals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established; deletion of the automatic renewal clause from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract with performance goals established; limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract automatic-renewal clause and provision for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination upon 90 days notice; reduction in territory or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter was unsure whether, if HCFA does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not publish the CPEP standards during a fiscal year, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be no performance evaluation for that year or whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous year's CPEP would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the evaluation period which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards measure is the Federal fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We make every effort to publish the criteria and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1st. If we do not publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the new fiscal year begins, readers may presume that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until and unless notified otherwise, the criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards which were previously in effect remain in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a new CPEP is published, it usually applies to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective period, as stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter states that contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in pilot projects which may involve additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding from HCFA. They assume this ``additional funding'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be considered as ``excessively high costs''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We encourage contractors to participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot projects which may result in improved quality, service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or efficiency in the administration of the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a contractor's participation in a pilot study or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program adversely affects its performance evaluation,

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommends that HCFA not base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards on the sliding scale of available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding but on true expectations of performance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore delete ``changes in fiscal operations due to fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constraints'' as a basis for developing criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each year the specific standards are revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and developed in concert with the specific budget and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance requirements, because that is the fiscally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible approach to develop uniform and fair performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for the Medicare contractor community. We will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to develop standards in conjunction with budget and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter notes that &sect;&sect;421.124 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
421.203 do not include the contract's provision for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the contract, subject to cost limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would deprive high cost contractors of the formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to choose between accepting limits on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursable costs and losing their Medicare contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contract allows us to offer a high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor the option of submitting a lower budget or losing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Medicare contract. Sections 421.124 and 421.203 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give us the authority to determine the amount which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable and adequate to efficiently and economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate as an intermediary and carrier. If we determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we cannot afford to contract with high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries or carriers, we may consider appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse contract action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Provisions of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on our review of the comments submitted, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making no substantive changes to the proposed revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules affecting criteria and standards for evaluating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediaries and carriers as published on December 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, (57 FR 233). Only minor editorial and technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions have been made to the proposed rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermediary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an entity that has a contract with HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine and make Medicare payments for Part A or Part B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits payable on a cost basis (or under the Prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payment System for hospitals) and to perform other related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions. For purposes of designating regional or alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional intermediaries for home health agencies and of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designating intermediaries for hospices under &sect;421.117 as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as for applying the performance criteria in &sect;421.120 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards in &sect;421.122 and any adverse action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from such application, the term intermediary also means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Blue Cross Plan which has entered into a subcontract approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HCFA with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform intermediary functions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In &sect;421.112(b), ``statistical standards'' is revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read ``performance standards''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. In &sect;421.118(b) ``statistical standards'' is revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read ``performance standards''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section 421.122 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.122 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Development of standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance criteria (&sect;421.120), HCFA develops detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards for use in evaluating intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance which may be based on historical performance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of acceptable statistical measures of variation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide intermediary experience during a base period, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changing program emphases or requirements. These standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also developed considering intermediary experience and evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors beyond intermediary's control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable factors that significantly affect an intermediary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance, but that are not within the intermediary's control, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Study the performance of intermediaries during the base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consider the noncontrollable factors in developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Publication of standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The development and revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing process. Therefore, before the beginning of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year period of October 1&hyph;September 30, HCFA publishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the performance standards as part of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing the performance criteria issued under &sect;421.120(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before the beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and standards begins after the publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 421.124 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.124 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediary's failure to perform efficiently and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;421.120 and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or by HCFA, such as reassignment of providers, offer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a short-term agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a contract. If an intermediary meets all criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in its overall performance, but does not meet them with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to a specific provider or class of providers, HCFA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reassign that provider or class of providers to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary in accordance with &sect;421.114. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediary to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount which HCFA finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated intermediary, those high costs may also be grounds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In subpart C a new &sect;421.201 is added to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Performance criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of performance criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the carrier evaluations mandated by section 1842(b)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, HCFA periodically assesses the performance of carriers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their Medicare operations using performance criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The criteria measure and evaluate carrier performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional responsibilities such as_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Accurate and timely payment determinations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Responsiveness to beneficiary, physician, and supplier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Proper management of administrative funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The standards evaluate the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA bases the performance criteria and standards on_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nationwide carrier experience;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Changes in carrier operations due to fiscal constraints; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) HCFA's objectives in achieving better performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Publication of criteria and standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the beginning of each evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal year period of October
1&hyph;September 30, HCFA publishes the performance criteria and standards as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before
the beginning of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the criteria and standards after the Federal
fiscal year begins, as long as the evaluation period of the carriers for the new criteria and standards begins after
the publication of the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A new &sect;421.203 is added to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;421.203
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Carrier's failure to perform efficiently and effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Failure by a carrier to meet, or demonstrate the capacity to meet, the criteria and standards specified in &sect;421.201
may be grounds for adverse action by the Secretary, such as contract termination or non-renewal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding whether or not a carrier meets the criteria and standards specified in &sect;421.201, if the
cost incurred by the carrier to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the amount that HCFA finds to be reasonable
and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated carrier, those high
costs may also be grounds for adverse action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule amends certain personnel requirements for cytotechnologists that perform testing in laboratories subject
to the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). We are providing an adequate
period of time for individuals to gain the necessary 2 years experience performing cytology testing which is currently
included in two of the provisions for qualifying as a cytotechnologist. Also, we are extending the time for individuals
to either meet the educational qualifications by virtue of completing training in an approved cytotechnology training
program or be certified by an approved organization. We are making these changes to prevent the loss of qualified personnel
in the field of cytotechnology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 28, 1992, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 57 FR 7002, rules that set forth the test performance requirements for laboratories that are subject to the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). We subsequently published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a related rule (January 19, 1993 (58 FR 5215)) that made technical corrections and addressed immediate concerns raised
by some of the approximately 16,000 comments on the publication of the February 28 regulations. This rule responds
to concerns raised by some of the commenters and pertains to limited aspects of the CLIA requirements: The period of
time during which an individual who needs 2 years experience as a cytotechnologist is allowed to earn that experience,
and the period of time that a person may either obtain appropriate training in a school approved by the Commission on
Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) or be certified by an organization approved by HHS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 28, 1992 CLIA regulations represented establishment of uniform personnel standards for cytotechnologists
for all laboratories offering cytology, regardless of location. Prior to these regulations, individuals working
in hospital cytology laboratories that were not licensed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 to
test specimens in interstate commerce were not subject to Federal personnel qualification requirements for cytotechnologists.
In addition, individuals employed in cytology laboratories that were not approved to participate in the Medicare
or Medicaid program were not subject to Federal requirements, including personnel requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the February 28, 1992 regulations, we stated that in developing the personnel standards for cytotechnologists,
it was not our intention to put out of work individuals currently employed as cytotechnologists. Our aim was to provide
qualification standards that would ensure quality of service and be in the best interest of the public health. Recognizing
the existing shortage of laboratory personnel, particularly cytotechnologists, we stated that we were expanding
the qualification requirements to allow individuals additional methods of qualifying. We stated, ``In our opinion,
many individuals currently working in laboratories, as a function of their employment, have gained valuable experience
in testing operations. In most instances in this rule, we are acknowledging the value of this experience, by allowing
those individuals, who do not meet the qualification requirements in these regulations, to continue their laboratory
employment while acquiring the education or training necessary to meet the requirements. The net effect of the personnel
standards will be to permit a preponderance of personnel presently working in laboratories to continue their employment
while they are updating their credentials to meet the national standards for laboratory personnel specified in this
rule.'' (57 FR 7083)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To &sect;493.1483, Standard: Cytotechnologist Qualifications, we added several alternative qualification standards
for cytotechnologists with education or experience requirements that had to be met by the effective date of the regulations
(September 1, 1992) or by a specified later date. To the previous Federal requirements, we added at &sect;493.1483(b)(4)
a current work experience requirement that had to be met by September 1, 1992, which was applicable to those individuals
who received their cytotechnology training and acquired their work experience prior to January 1, 1969. At &sect;493.1483(b)(5),
we added a new provision requiring current work experience by September 1, 1993, in addition to requiring on or before
September 1, 1994, that individuals either complete their cytotechnology training in an approved school or be certified
in cytotechnology by an organization approved by HHS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Revisions to the Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have now determined that we did not provide sufficient time for cytotechnologists to meet current standards. Without
prior notification, the February 28, 1992 rule required individuals, who obtained their education and training
prior to January 1, 1969, 6 months to acquire 2 years of current work experience. Also, individuals, who trained outside
of the United States, were given 1 year and 6 months to fulfill the requirement of 2 years for current work experience
in the United States. Therefore, we are revising the dates originally published in the February 28, 1992 rule at &sect;493.1483(b)
(4) and (5) concerning personnel requirements for cytotechnologists who qualified under Federal regulations and
for individuals who trained outside of the United States. Based on public concern and our analysis of anticipated
availability of qualified individuals, we are revising our regulations to allow all individuals 2 full years from
September 1, 1992, the effective date of our personnel requirements, to gain the necessary experience to qualify
under the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in &sect;493.1483(b)(4), we are revising the date from September 1, 1992 to September 1, 1994, to enable
a previously qualified cytotechnologist to continue working without interruption and obtain the necessary work
experience. In &sect;493.1483(b)(5)(i), we are similarly revising the date from September 1, 1993 to September
1, 1994 to allow an individual trained outside the United States and an individual who does not meet the other qualification
standards an opportunity to obtain the 2 years of slide examination experience within the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a technical revision to our rules, we note that &sect;493.1483(b)(5)(ii) provides that an individual qualifying
as a cytotechnologist must, on or before September 1, 1994, have either graduated from a school of cytotechnology
approved by the CAHEA or be certified by an organization approved by the Department. It is possible that the CAHEA may
cease to function as an accrediting organization before the Department has recognized any alternative certifying
organization. In order to prevent the possibility that individuals will not have 2 full years to be certified by an
approved certifying organization, we are extending the date from September 1, 1994 to September 1, 1995. This will
allow time for the Department to recognize organizations that certify cytology personnel and minimize the loss of
currently employed individuals at a time when there is an existing shortage of qualified cytology personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also making a conforming change to &sect;493.1483(b)(1) to provide that a school of cytotechnology must be
accredited by CAHEA ``or other organization approved by HHS.''

III. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay of Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite public comment on proposed requirements. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a reference to the
legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms and substances of the proposed rule or a description
of the subjects and issues involved. This procedure can be waived, however, if an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment
procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest and incorporates a statement of the
finding and its reasons in the rule issued.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that these revisions are essential to the effective implementation of the CLIA program, and to delay the
effective date would potentially disrupt public access to laboratory services, unnecessarily expose laboratories
to greater costs than are needed to help assure quality testing, and create unnecessary confusion among laboratories
in understanding the standards they must meet. Without immediate revision of the regulations, we believe there may
be shortages of cytotechnologists in some areas resulting in limited access to cytology services. Therefore, we
believe it is contrary to the public interest to go through a notice-and-comment procedure, and we find good cause
to waive the notice of proposed rulemaking and to issue this final rule on an interim basis. For these same reasons,
we find there is good cause to dispense with a delayed effective date of these regulations. Although the regulations
are final and effective on the date of publication, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment.

IV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all laboratories are considered to be small entities.
Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule with comment period revises personnel requirements for cytotechnologists by extending the dates
by which they must meet the qualification requirements. We are unable to quantify the number of individuals, laboratories,
or rural hospitals affected by this rule. In the laboratory industry generally, recent surveys indicate that 80 percent
of U.S. laboratories have experienced a shortage of technical personnel. A shortage of cytotechnologists throughout
the United States has been demonstrated through anecdotal studies of wages and vacancy rates. According to the American
Hospital Association's 1991 Survey of Human Resources, there was a full-time equivalent vacancy rate of 12.2 percent
for cytotechnologists in hospital laboratories. The survey also reported that more than 60 days were required to
fill almost two-thirds of the full-time vacancies. The average length of time required to fill approximately half
of the full-time vacancies was over 90 days. This scarcity level existed prior to the imposition of Federal personnel
standards that might lead to lesser numbers of qualified cytotechnologists.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of a registry that indicates the actual number of cytotechnologists, their employment and age distribution,
the amount and type of work they do, and the specific number of individuals that meet all the qualifications except
the two years' experience, we cannot determine the cause of this shortage or predict when the shortage will end. Based
on data projections from the Census Bureau and the National Health Interview Survey, the demand for Pap smears in women
18 and older was nearly 79 million in 1992 and is expected to increase. If there is an existing shortage of personnel
and we anticipate the increased demand for cytology services, the impact of this regulation would be beneficial to
laboratories because it will allow larger numbers of cytotechnologists to meet Federal personnel requirements.
Although we cannot determine whether this final rule's provisions to allow a longer period of time for certain individuals
to accumulate required experience will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities or small
rural hospitals, because of the lack of data, we have determined that its impact is beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, one of the new methods of qualifying as a cytotechnologist includes graduation, by September
1, 1994, from a CAHEA-approved school. In the event that CAHEA should cease to function as an accrediting agency prior
to September 1, 1994, individuals may not be able to avail themselves of this method of qualifying as a cytotechnologist.
To accommodate individuals seeking to qualify under this provision, we are extending the date of graduation to September
1, 1995. This should provide sufficient time for us to formally recognize another accrediting organization, if that
becomes necessary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS announces the 1994 fishery specifications and management measures for groundfish taken in the U.S. exclusive
economic zone and state waters off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California as authorized by the Pacific Coast
Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The specifications include the level of the acceptable biological catch
(ABC) and harvest guidelines including the distribution between domestic and foreign fishing operations. The management
measures for 1994 are designed to keep landings within the harvest guidelines, for those species for which there are
harvest guidelines and to achieve the goals and objectives of the FMP and its implementing regulations. The intended
effect of these actions is to establish allowable harvest levels of Pacific coast groundfish and to implement management
measures designed to achieve but not exceed those harvest levels while extending fishing and processing opportunities
as long as possible during the year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP requires that fishery specifications for groundfish be evaluated each calendar year, that harvest guidelines
or quotas be specified for species or species groups in need of additional protection, and that management measures
designed to achieve the harvest guidelines or quotas be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and implemented by January 1, the beginning of the next fishing year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final fishery specifications and management measures have been recommended by the Council and approved by
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for implementation on January 1, 1994. The ABCs and harvest guidelines announced
herein are the basis for the management measures recommended for 1994, and may be modified during the year as provided
in the FMP. Unless otherwise specified, all of the management measures announced in this notice are considered ``routine,''
and have been so designated at 50 CFR 663.23. The exception is trip limits in the open-access fisheries for groundfish
caught incidentally in nongroundfish gear (such as trawl gear used to fish for pink shrimp, spot or ridgeback prawns,
California halibut, or sea cucumbers). These trip limits will be designated ``routine'' in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice so that they may be adjusted as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FMP provides for announcement of the final fishery specifications in the

 after consideration at two Council meetings. The process for adopting ABCs and harvest guidelines for 1994 was initiated
early in 1993 so that preliminary specifications could be adopted by the Council at its September 1993 meeting. New
stock assessments, the basis for changes to the 1993 ABCs, were distributed to the public prior to the September Council
meeting. The Council's scientific and industry advisory committees and the public reviewed and commented on the
documents. After receiving comments, the Council adopted preliminary ABCs and harvest guidelines at its September
meeting, which were subsequently made available to the public. Comments were requested before and at the November
Council meeting. The final recommendations of harvest specifications and management measures designed to achieve
those specifications, adopted at the November Council meeting, were forwarded to the Secretary for implementation
by January 1, 1994.

Open-Access and Limited-Entry Allocations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fishery specifications include ABCs, the designation of harvest guidelines or quotas for species that need individual
management, the apportionment of the harvest guidelines or quotas between domestic and foreign fisheries, and subsequent
allocation between the open-access and limited-entry segments of the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final 1994 specifications (except for DAP, DAH, JVP, and TALFF) are listed in Table 1, followed by a discussion
of each specification that differs from 1993 levels. As in the past, these specifications include fish caught in state
ocean waters (0&hyph;3 nautical miles offshore) as well as fish caught in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (3&hyph;200
nautical miles offshore).

The yellowtail rockfish assessment addresses three separate areas: Vancouver, Columbia north of Cape Lookout,
and Columbia south of Cape Lookout plus Eureka. For this table, the Columbia ABC means north Columbia only, and the
Eureka ABC means Eureka plus south Columbia. The total ABC for yellowtail rockfish is divided into two harvest guidelines:
4,160 mt for the northern area (Vancouver plus Columbia north of Cape Lookout) and 2,580 mt for the southern area (Eureka
plus Columbia area south of Cape Lookout). (Separate harvest guidelines are established for the Sebastes complex
north and south of the Eureka-Columbia border. Therefore, 300 mt of the yellowtail rockfish southern harvest guideline
is included in the southern Sebastes complex harvest guideline, and the remainder of the yellowtail rockfish southern
harvest guideline is included in the northern Sebastes complex harvest guideline.) A 16 percent discard factor will
be added to certain landings of yellowtail rockfish inseason. This will affect inseason landings estimates for the
Sebastes complex also.

Changes to the ABCs and Harvest Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 final ABCs are changed from the 1993 levels for the following species: Pacific whiting, shortbelly rockfish,
widow rockfish, chilipepper, yellowtail rockfish, remaining rockfish, English sole, and petrale sole. These changes
are based on the best available scientific information. Information considered in determining the ABCs is available
from the Council (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and was distributed to the public in the Council's stock assessment and fishery evaluation (SAFE) document. The
SAFE document, required under the guidelines for Fishery Management Plans at 50 CFR part 602, summarizes the best
available scientific information concerning the past, present, and possible future condition of the stocks and
fisheries being managed under Federal regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those species or species groups with harvest guidelines in 1993 will continue to be managed with harvest guidelines
in 1994. As in 1993, no quotas are established. The harvest guidelines are changed from those for 1993 for Pacific whiting,
jack mackerel, Pacific ocean perch (POP), shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, thornyheads, yellowtail rockfish,
the

 complex in the Vancouver/Columbia subareas, Dover sole in the Columbia subarea and coastwide, and new harvest guidelines

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 complex in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the ABCs and harvest guidelines are described below. All other ABC and annual harvest guideline specifications
announced in Tables 1 and 2 for 1993 (58 FR 2990, January 7, 1993) will apply again in 1994 and are included in Table 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lingcod.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ABC for lingcod remains at 7,000 mt, but a new harvest guideline is established at 4,000 mt in 1994, approximating
peak landings during the past 10 years. Landings ranged between 3,000 and 3,500 mt in 1989&hyph;1991. The ABC is based
on historical landings rather than a scientific stock assessment, and has not been updated since 1986. A stock assessment
for lingcod is planned for the near future. The Council was concerned that the new open-access fishery would expand
its lingcod harvest. In order to discourage expansion pending completion of the new stock assessment, a harvest guideline
was designated. Based on the harvest guideline, open-access and limited-entry allocations are being specified.
If effort shifts into this fishery, trip limits may be imposed to keep landings within the allocations and/or harvest
guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pacific whiting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ABC for Pacific whiting in 1994 (325,000 mt for the United States (U.S.) and Canada combined) is substantially
higher than in 1993 (177,000 mt) for several reasons. The 1992 hydroacoustic survey utilized new, more sensitive
equipment, and extended further offshore and further north to better encompass the range of pacific whiting. As a
result, the biomass estimate was more than double the previous estimate. In recent years, the Council has adopted
a hybrid fishing strategy that combines the features of a constant fishing mortality (F) strategy at higher levels
of biomass, and, at lower levels of biomass, a variable F strategy where fishing mortality for a particular year in
proportional to the level of female spawning biomass. If this moderate harvest policy is applied to the new projected
numbers in 1994, the potential yield would be 450,000 mt. However, the Council recommended a more conservative harvest
rate for 1994, which provides a yield of 325,000 mt, to provide for cautious exploitation until further information
can be obtained; the large increase in projected yield is due to a single survey estimate that will not be replicated
until 1995. In addition, the Council felt it prudent to acknowledge the possibility of a combined U.S. and Canadian
harvest in excess of the U.S.-Canada ABC as occurred in 1992 and 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These overages (15 percent in 1993) have not caused a biological problem, particularly given the large increase in
the ABC in 1994. The Council recommended that the U.S. share in 1994 continue at 80 percent of the U.S.-Canada ABC, as
was the case in 1993, providing a U.S. harvest guideline of 260,000 mt. If Canada continues to calculate its share in
the same manner as in 1992 and 1993, the U.S. and Canadian total harvest would be 14 percent above the coastwide ABC in
1994. However, the total harvest would be lower than the overfishing level, and lower than the amount that would have
been taken if the Council had chosen to use the moderate harvest rate level, as in 1993, in determining the ABC. If recruitment
remains near the median level, a decline in annual yield is expected over the next few years, and will be slightly more
severe if the catch exceeds the harvest guideline. Bilateral negotiations with Canada are expected to continue to
resolve this issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Jack mackerel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ABC is maintained at 52,600 mt, the same level as in 1993, and the harvest guideline is adjusted upward to equal the
ABC. In 1992, the harvest guideline has been set at 46,500 mt, lower than the ABC, to deduct the amount of jack mackerel
that was expected to be taken beyond 200 nautical miles (nm). However, the fishery did not materialize and the Council
recommended setting the harvest guideline equal to ABC in 1993. This change inadvertently was not announced with
the 1993 specifications in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Chilipepper rockfish

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In 1993, the coastwide ABC was set at 3,600 mt with nearly all the catch coming from the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception
subareas. The catch in 1992 was about 2,895 mt; 1993 landings data are not yet available for this species. A new assessment
indicates that the ABC could be higher, up to 5,000 mt, due to a very strong 1984 year class, and that the stock is at a level
above that expected under the recommended level of exploitation. However, the Council recommended a lower ABC of
4,000 mt for 1994, higher than the expected 1993 catch, but less than the maximum amount suggested by the assessment
and close to the long-term average yield. Although a higher ABC appears supportable from the assessment, it is not
recommended because bocaccio, which is at a low stock level and has an ABC of 1,540 mt and 1993 landings near that level,
are unavoidably caught with chilipepper. There is no harvest guideline at this time for chilipepper rockfish.

Pacific ocean perch (POP)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on the 1992 stock assessment, the ABC for POP remains at zero. A rebuilding program was established for POP in
1981, following depletion of this stock during the 1960's and early 1970's. Significant rebuilding has not been detected.
The stock abundance is estimated to be about 50 percent of its target level and recent harvests of about 1,000 mt are
near the level of overfishing. If the stock recovers to its target level, then annual yields of about 1,400 mt may be
possible. Strong year classes which are necessary to rebuild the stock occur infrequently, so the lack of rebuilding
is not unexpected. The harvest guideline continues to be set at the level that accommodates the incidental catch of
POP caught while fishing for other species. The reduction of the harvest guideline from 1,550 mt in 1993 to 1,300 mt
in 1994 results from converting the harvest guideline from an estimate of total catch (retention plus discards) to
an estimate of landed catch (retention only). The harvest guideline of 1,550 mt in 1993 applied to the total catch,
1,300 mt for landed catch and a 250-mt (16 percent) estimate of trip-limit induced discards. In 1994, the harvest guideline
represents only the landed catch, and therefore is lowered to 1,300 mt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the last several years, the harvest guideline, in conjunction with a very small trip limit, was necessary to accommodate
only incidental catches of POP which otherwise would have been discarded. The trip limit will not be relaxed to achieve
the harvest guideline, but may be changed to reflect revised estimates of bycatch levels. The catch in 1993 is projected
to be about 1,447 mt, 93 percent of the harvest guideline. The 1994 harvest guideline is consistent with the Council's
policy to allow for incidental catches during the 20-year rebuilding schedule for POP.

Shortbelly rockfish
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Shortbelly rockfish remains an unexploited stock and thus is difficult to assess quantitatively. In recent years,
the ABC has been maintained at 13,000 mt until further data can be collected. However, the midpoint of the range of recently
revised yield estimates is 23,500 mt. The Council agreed that this represents the best available scientific information
and recommended that the harvest guideline be set equal to the ABC. To date, a fishery for this species has not developed.
Less than 10 mt were taken in 1992 and similar landings have occurred in 1993.

Widow rockfish.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new assessment was conducted for widow rockfish which explored the consequences of near-term landings between
5,000&hyph;7,000 mt. If recent recruitment remains near the average, then stock abundance is expected to remain
nearly constant with annual landings of 7,000 mt (which would, including discards, indicate a total harvest of 8,150
mt) in 1994&hyph;1996. With annual harvest at 6,500 mt, stock abundance would be expected to increase slightly towards
its target level. However, the assessment also provides a plausible alternative, based on lower stock abundance
and recent recruitment at a lower, median level, which would support landings of only 5,000 mt during 1994&hyph;1996.
Given this uncertainty, the ABC and HG are both set at 6,500 mt for 1994.

Thornyheads.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ABCs for shortspine and longspine thornyheads are the same as in 1993. The two species of thornyhead cannot be practically
separated in the landings, so, as in 1993, the 1994 harvest guideline is set for the combined species. However, like
POP, the harvest guideline is adjusted so that it applies only to landed catch in 1994. Under the assumption that equal
amounts of each species will be in the catch, the harvest guideline is set at 6,440 mt for both species combined (the
1993 harvest guideline of 7,000 mt, which represented the total catch, minus 8 percent for trip limit induced discards).
This would result in a shortspine thornyhead catch equal to its overfishing level of 3,500 mt and a longspine catch
that is less than its ABC of 10,100 mt. However, the percentage of shortspine thornyheads in 1991 and 1992 has been lower
than 50 percent, and therefore the catches in these years have been below the overfishing level. During the first half
of 1993, shortspine contributed only 35 percent of the thornyhead landings. If the percentage shortspine in 1994
remains at this reduced level as expected, the 1994 catch would be 2,450 mt, well below the overfishing level.

Yellowtail rockfish.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new stock assessment was conducted which indicates that 1983 and 1984 were stronger year classes than previously
thought. The ABCs which were applied to the Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka subareas separately in the past, are applied
to different subareas in 1994, coinciding with the subareas used in the new stock assessment. These areas are: The
Eureka subarea combined with the Columbia subarea south of Cape Falcon (40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; to 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;46
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude); the Columbia subarea north of Cape Falcon (45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;46
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; to 47
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude); and the Vancouver subarea between 47
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; and 49
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude which includes Canadian waters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the north Columbia subarea, the assessment indicates a stock that is slowly declining, and further declines are
expected as the 1983&hyph;1984 year class moves through the stock. The 1994 4,160 mt ABC in this area is higher than
the 1992 catch and similar to average catches between 1986&hyph;1989. In the Vancouver subarea, which extends into
Canadian waters, there are contrary indicators of stock condition. Trawl survey data indicate a stable healthy stock
from 1980&hyph;1992, whereas age composition data do not indicate a particularly strong 1983&hyph;1984 year class
and implies a steeply declining stock. Therefore the ABC for the Vancouver subarea is more conservative, based on
the lower end of the optimistic scenario in the stock assessment, and the U.S. portion is estimated at 60 percent, or
1,190 mt. In the southern subareas (Eureka/south Columbia), the stock is believed to have recently increased because
of the strong 1983&hyph;1984 year classes, but will experience a declining trend as the strong year classes are exploited.
In 1993, 300 mt of the ABC was set aside for the Eureka subarea, and a harvest guideline, equal to the sum of the ABCs, was
set only for the U.S. Vancouver/Columbia subareas combined. In 1994, however, two harvest guidelines are set for
yellowtail rockfish, dividing the U.S. Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka subareas at Cape Falcon, Oregon. The 4,160
mt harvest guideline in the northern subareas (U.S. Vancouver/north Columbia) is the sum of the ABCs. In the southern
area (south Columbia/Eureka), the harvest guideline is set equal to the ABC of 2,580 mt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Remaining rockfish in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas includes all rockfish except POP, widow rockfish,
shortbelly rockfish, bocaccio and chilipepper rockfish. The ABCs for remaining rockfish have been unchanged since
1983. The ABCs in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas were set at 1.2 times the 1977 catch, for a total of 9,500
mt. During 1983&hyph;1992, the catch of remaining rockfish in this area has ranged from 5,100 mt to 7,200 mt with an
average of 6,600 mt. Although annual catches never have achieved the 9,500 mt ABC, an examination of declines in average
length for several rockfish species suggests that the fishery is having a noticeable impact. Although there is insufficient
information to conduct a quantitative stock assessment for the remaining rockfish in this southern area, an increase
in effort in this area should not be encouraged, and therefore the ABC is reduced to 7,000 mt, the upper range of harvest
in recent years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remaining rockfish in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas are defined as all rockfish except POP, yellowtail rockfish,
canary rockfish, widow rockfish, and shortbelly rockfish. The ABC is not changed in 1994.

guideline to better respond to effort shifts during the season.

Dover sole.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no change to any of the subarea or coastwide ABCs for Dover sole. At its November 1992 meeting, to mitigate the
economic impact of abrupt reductions in ABC, the Council adopted a policy to reduce the harvest (and therefore the
harvest guideline) in the Columbia subarea by 1,000 mt annually until the 4,000 mt ABC for that subarea is reached in
1995. This is the second year of the step-down, and therefore the harvest guideline in the Columbia subarea is reduced
from 6,000 mt in 1993 to 5,000 mt in 1994, 1,000 mt above the 1994 ABC. Consequently, the coastwide harvest guideline,
which is the sum of the subarea harvest guidelines, is 16,900 mt, 1,000 mt higher than the sum of the ABCs. As stated at
58 FR 2994 (January 7, 1993), the risk of overfishing Dover sole in the Columbia subarea is not appreciably increased
by setting the harvest guideline greater than the ABC in 1993 and 1994. The Columbia subarea catch has declined from
an average of 7,970 mt in 1988&hyph;1991 to 5,665 mt in 1992, and landings are expected to be about 5,800 mt in 1993.

English sole. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The coastwide ABC of 1,900 mt in 1993 is changed to two area ABCs in 1994: 2,000 mt for the Vancouver-Columbia area and
1,100 mt for the Eureka-Monterey-Conception area. A new stock assessment was conducted only for the Vancouver-Columbia
area. It indicated high recruitment during 1977&hyph;1992. The large biomass, combined with the early age at maturity
which allows a high exploitation rate, suggest that a ten-fold increase in short-term yield may be possible in the
Vancouver-Columbia area. However, catches have averaged only about 2,100 mt between 1983&hyph;1991. The 1994 ABC
is set conservatively, at 2,000 mt in this area, approximately double the coastwide average catch during 1983&hyph;1991.
The southern area ABC is set near the recent average catch because trawl surveys indicate little trend in abundance.
There is no harvest guideline for English sole.

A new stock assessment for the Vancouver and Columbia subareas was conducted which resulted in the ABC for the two subareas
being combined and lowered from 1,700 mt in 1993 to 1,200 mt in 1994. The assessment indicates that the stock in this
area is essentially at the expected long-term average level of abundance, and recent yields are slightly below the
potential. In addition, the ABC is lowered to exclude the portion that applied to Canadian waters that mistakenly
was included in the previous ABC. There is no harvest guideline for petrale sole.

Setting Harvest Guidelines Greater Than ABC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most cases, harvest guidelines equal the ABCs, or prorated ABCs, for specific areas. However, for 1994 as in 1993,
the Council recommended harvest guidelines that exceed the ABCs for three species, POP, Dover sole in the Columbia
subarea, and shortspine thornyheads. The FMP requires that the Council consider certain factors when setting a harvest
guideline above an ABC. These factors were analyzed by the Council's Groundfish Management Team (GMT) and considered
at the Council's November 1993 meeting before recommending the 1994 harvest guidelines. These factors also were
considered in establishing the 20-year rebuilding schedule for POP in the 1981 FMP, and in the most recent stock assessments
for POP and Dover sole in the Council's August 1992 SAFE document, which provided the basis for the 1993 and 1994 ABCs.
A synopsis of these issues appears in the above discussion of these species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overfishing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP defines ``overfishing'' as a fishing mortality rate that would, in the long-term, reduce the spawning biomass
per recruit below 20 percent of what it would have been if the stock had never been exploited (unless the species is above
the level that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY)). The rate is defined in terms of the percentage of
the stock removed per year. Therefore, a large amount of catch can cause overfishing at any stock abundance level.
Conversely, overfishing does not necessarily occur for stocks at low abundance levels if the catch can be kept to a
sufficiently small fraction of that stock level. The target rate of exploitation for west coast groundfish typically
is the rate that would reduce spawning biomass per recruit to 35 percent of its unfished level. This desired rate of
fishing will always be less than the overfishing rate, so there is a buffer between the management target and the level
that could harm the stock's long-term potential productivity. If the overfishing level is reached, the Guidelines
for Fishery Management Plans at 50 CFR part 602 require the Council to identify actions to be undertaken to alleviate
overfishing. POP is the only species believed to be near its overfishing level in 1993, and no others are expected to
be overfished in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POP was depleted off Washington and Oregon mainly by foreign fishing during the 1960's and early 1970's. In 1981, a
rebuilding program was established for POP in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas. (POP are neither common nor important
in the more southern areas). A review in 1992 of fishery and survey data does not indicate any significant rebuilding.
The stock is estimated to be about 50 percent of its MSY level and recent harvests are near the level of overfishing (1,100
mt). The review also indicates that strong year classes, which are necessary to rebuild the stock, occur infrequently
so the lack of rebuilding is not expected. The Council's GMT recognized that, as long as trawling occurs in these areas,
incidental catches of POP will result. The GMT recommended that trip limits continue to be set to discourage targeting
on POP while allowing landings of incidental catches.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not anticipated that lowering the level of the trip limit (or the harvest guideline) will reduce the fishing mortality
of POP. The level of catch will vary with effort in the Vancouver-Columbia area, and it is possible that the overfishing
level will be reached, but not substantially exceeded, in 1994. Under the same harvest guideline and trip limit (3,000
pounds (1,361 kg) or 20 percent of all groundfish per trip, whichever is less), the total landings were 1,378 mt in 1991,
1,023 mt in 1992, and are projected at 1,214 mt in 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Stock assessments and inseason catch monitoring are designed to account for all fishing mortality, including that
resulting from fish discarded at sea. Discards of rockfish and sablefish in the fishery for whiting processed at sea
are well-monitored and are accounted for inseason as they occur. In the other fisheries, discards caused by trip limits
are not monitored, so discard factors have been developed to reasonably account for this extra catch. These discard
factors are applied in several ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases (trawl sablefish, widow rockfish, bocaccio, Dover sole), the discard factor was used in the stock assessment
and in the setting of the ABC. Therefore the ABC and harvest guideline are defined in terms of landed catch. No additional
discard factor is applied to inseason catch projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other cases (yellowtail rockfish, POP, thornyheads), a discard factor was not anticipated in the stock assessment
leading to the setting of the ABC because the assessment was conducted before the trip limits became low enough to induce
discards. For POP and thornyheads, an estimate of discards caused by trip limits has been subtracted from the ABC so
that the harvest guideline represents only the landed catch. For yellowtail rockfish, a variety of gears with different
discard levels contribute to the catch, so the harvest guideline is set equal to ABC and landings are adjusted by a discard
factor during the season to estimate total removals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of trip limit discard is not monitored. A level previously measured for widow rockfish (16 percent) in a scientific
study is assumed to be appropriate for the commercial fisheries for widow rockfish, yellowtail rockfish and POP.
A lower level of 8 percent is used for the deepwater thornyhead fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discarded bycatch in the Pacific whiting fishery always is counted towards the harvest guideline inseason because
this source of discard is measured accurately by observers and is variable from year to year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foreign and domestic fisheries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For those species needing individual management that will not be fully utilized by domestic processors or harvesters,
and that can be caught without severely impacting species that are fully utilized by domestic processors or harvesters,
the harvest guidelines or quotas may be apportioned to domestic annual harvest (DAH, which includes domestic annual
processing (DAP) and joint venture processing (JVP)) and the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). In
1994, there are no surplus groundfish available for joint venture or foreign fishing operations. Consequently,
all the harvest guidelines in 1994 are designated entirely for DAP (which also equals DAH), and JVP and TALFF are set
at zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the unlikely event that a foreign or joint venture fishery should occur, the incidental catch levels would be the
same as announced at Table 2, footnote 1 of 58 FR 2990 (January 7, 1993).

The Limited-Entry Program_Effective January 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 6 to the FMP establishes a limited-entry program which divides the groundfish fishery into two components,
the limited-entry fishery and the open-access fishery, each of which has its own allocations and management measures.
The limited-entry and open-access allocations are calculated according to a formula specified in the FMP and implementing
regulations, and are announced annually with the ABC and harvest guideline specifications. At its November 1993
meeting, the Council recommended the species and areas subject to open-access and limited-entry allocations in
1994, and the Regional Director calculated the amounts of the allocations which are presented in Table 1. Unless otherwise
specified, the limited-entry and open-access allocations are treated as harvest guidelines in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Open-access allocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The open-access fishery means the fishery composed of vessels using (i) exempt gear, or (ii) longline or pot (trap)
gear used pursuant to the harvest guidelines, quotas, and other management measures governing the open-access fishery.
Exempt gear means all types of fishing gear except groundfish trawl, longline, and pots. (Exempt gear includes trawls
used to harvest pink shrimp or spot or ridgeback prawns (shrimp trawls), and, south of Point Arena, California, California
halibut, or sea cucumbers.) Simply put, open-access gear is all types of fishing gear except longline, pot, or groundfish
trawl gear fished by a vessel that has a limited-entry permit affixed with a gear endorsement for that gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open-access allocation is derived by applying the open-access allocation percentage to the annual harvest guideline
or quota after subtracting any set asides for recreational fishing or treaty Indians under sections II.E. (b) and
(c) of the Appendix to part 663. For those species in which the open-access share would have been less than one percent,
no open-access allocation is specified for 1994 because significant open-access effort is not anticipated. At the
time the calculations were made, the status of some vessels (whether or not they would receive a limited-entry permit)
was not certain. The catch by these vessels was divided equally between the limited-entry and open-access allocations.
The highest ``undecided'' amount is 4.7 percent for the catch of species used to represent bocaccio during the window
period. Therefore the greatest potential error in any of the open-access or limited-entry allocations is less than
2.5 percent of the harvest guideline. This level of error would not result in a change in any of the trip limits for the
limited-entry or open-access fisheries.

Limited-entry allocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The limited-entry fishery means the fishery composed of vessels using limited-entry gear fished pursuant to the
harvest guidelines, quotas, and other management measures governing the limited-entry fishery. Limited-entry
gear means longline, pot, or groundfish trawl gear used under the authority of a valid limited-entry permit, issued
under 50 CFR part 663, affixed with an endorsement for that gear. (Groundfish trawl gear excludes shrimp trawls used
to harvest pink shrimp, spot prawns, or ridgeback prawns, and other trawls used to fish for California halibut or sea
cucumbers south of Pt. Arena, California.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited-entry allocation is the allowable catch (harvest guideline or quota) reduced by: (1) Set asides, if any,
for treaty Indian fisheries or recreational fisheries, and (2) the open-access allocation.

II. 1994 Management Measures_Commercial Fishery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the 1994 management measures announced in this notice have been designated as ``routine'' under the procedures
contained in Amendment 4 to the FMP (56 FR 736, January 8, 1991). The ``routine'' designation means that a measure is
likely to need adjustment on an annual or more frequent basis, and that it may be implemented and adjusted for a specified
species or species group and gear type after consideration at a single Council meeting. However, the effects of the
particularly measure must have been analyzed previously, the purpose of the measure must be the same as when it was
designated as routine, and the measure must be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those management measures not yet designated as routine apply to the harvest of groundfish taken incidentally in
non-groundfish fisheries (in the open-access fishery) for pink shrimp, spot and ridgeback prawns, California halibut,
and sea cucumbers. These fisheries must be managed under ``routine'' trip limits to assure that open-access allocations
are not exceeded. The trip limits for pink shrimp, and spot and ridgeback prawns previously were codified at 50 CFR
663.24; those for California halibut and sea cucumbers are announced herein for the first time. In the future, the
Council also may recommend designating trip limits for lingcod as routine, so that they may be adjusted in season to
achieve its harvest guideline which was specified for the first time in 1994.

Limited-entry fishery. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following management measures apply to vessels operating in the limited-entry fishery after January 1, 1994,
and are designed to keep landings within the harvest guidelines or limited-entry allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Sebastes complex (including yellowtail rockfish and Bocaccio). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning January 1, 1993, the cumulative trip limit for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex coastwide was 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) in a 2-week period, of which no more than 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) could
be bocaccio taken south of Cape Mendocino, or 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) could be yellowtail rockfish caught north of
Coos Bay, Oregon. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex trip limit remained the same all year, but the trip limit for yellowtail rockfish was lowered to 6,000 pounds
(2,722 kg) in late April, and the bacaccio trip limit was increased to 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg) in early October. By
the end of 1993, landings of bocaccio are yellowtail rockfish and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex catches are expected to exceed their harvest guideline in the Vancouver/Columbia subareas by as much as 27
percent and 18 percent, respectively. The Council did not recommend further reductions in the trip limit for yellowtail
rockfish in 1993 because the ABC and harvest guideline for this species were expected to increase substantially in
1994, and the overage in 1993 is not expected to reduce future productivity. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex harvest guideline was exceeded entirely due to the overage in the yellowtail rockfish landings, so the trip
limit for the complex was not reduced for the same reasons as for yellowtail rockfish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, the cumulative trip limit period for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex (including yellowtail rockfish and bocaccio) is extended from 2 weeks to a calendar month, consistent with
the period for widow rockfish and the Dover sole/thornyhead/sablefish complex. However, the trip limit is not simply
doubled because experience has shown that the opportunity for landings, and thus catch rates, increase as the trip
limit period is lengthened. Consequently, the coastwide trip limit for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
complex is increased to only 80,000 pounds (36,290 kg) per calendar month in 1994. Analysis of 1993 Washington and
Oregon landings accumulated by 4-week periods indicated that this trip limit will not be severely constraining because
few cumulative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
trips exceeded 80,000 pounds (36,290 kg) in 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the management line for yellowtail rockfish is moved north to Cape Lookout, Oregon (45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;20
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;15
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude), to better define the areas where this species is concentrated. The cumulative trip limit for
yellowtail rockfish north of Cape Lookout is set at 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) per month, intermediate to the 1993 levels
(6,000 pounds (2,722 kg) and 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) per 2-week periods), because landings in 1993 are believed to
have been similar to the 1994 harvest guideline for the same area. To keep landings from accelerating south of the line,
as occurred in 1992, a trip limit of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per month is established for yellowtail rockfish caught
south of Cape Lookout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because landings of bocaccio did not reach the 1993 harvest guideline, the trip limit is almost doubled to 30,000 pounds
(13,608 kg) per month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 restrictions limited a vessel to the northern, more restrictive trip limit for yellowtail rockfish if operating
on both sides of the line at Coos Bay. This was a problem for vessels that took the yellowtail rockfish limit south of
Coos Bay at the beginning of the month, and then fished north of the line for the DTS complex because yellowtail rockfish
is commonly taken as bycatch. The yellowtail rockfish would either need to be discarded or the vessel would be in violation
of the more restrictive northern limit. The same problem would exist north and south of Cape Lookout in 1994. Consequently,
the Council endorsed a declaration procedure by the States of Oregon and Washington that would allow a fisherman to
operate both north and south of Cape Lookout during a month and retain up to the southern limit of yellowtail rockfish,
if the State is notified in advance where the vessel will be operating on each trip that crosses the line during that
month. These declarations, which are binding for the trip, are similar, but not identical, to those used in the past.
The State where the fish will be landed (Oregon or Washington) should be contacted for more complete information on
these procedures, which may differ between the two States. The phone numbers of the State agencies appear in Section
III.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Widow rockfish. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 cumulative trip limit for widow rockfish initially was set at 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) per 4-week period,
but was reduced to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) per trip on December 1, 1993. Landings of widow rockfish are projected to
exceed the harvest guideline by as much as 12 percent in 1993. For 1994, the trip limit is again initially set at 30,000
pounds (13,608 kg), but the period is slightly extended from 4-weeks to a calendar month. Reducing the number of trip
limit periods from 13 4-week periods (of 28 days) to 12 calendar months (of 30&hyph;31 days) is intended to reduce landings
from 1993 levels and avoid the need for further trip limit reductions before the fall of 1994.

POP. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 trip limit for POP is the same as in 1991&hyph;1993: 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) or 20 percent of all fish on board,
whichever is less, in landings of POP above 1,000 pounds (454 kg). This is not a cumulative limit because it is intended
to accommodate only incidental catches. It therefore applies to each fishing trip. Because the trip limit for POP
is intended to accommodate only unavoidable incidental catches, it will not be increased if landings are lower than
the harvest guideline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DTS complex (Dover sole, thornyheads, and trawl-caught sablefish). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In January 1993, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex was 45,000 pounds (20,412 kg) per 2-week period, of which
no more than 20,000 pounds (9,072 kg) could be thornyheads and no more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg), or 25 percent of the
DTS complex, whichever was greater, could be sablefish. In April, the trip limits were reduced and applied on a 4-week
cumulative basis: 60,000 pounds (27,216 kg) of the DTS complex, of which no more than 35,000 pounds (15,876 kg) could
be thornyheads. The sablefish trip limit remained the same (but was expected to result in lower landings due to the
reduction in the trip limit for the complex) until September when a ceiling of 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) per trip was added.
Nonetheless, landings continued at high levels and, at the Council's November 1993 meeting, were projected to exceed
the harvest guidelines for trawl-caught sablefish by 18 percent and for thornyheads by 17 percent. Dover sole landings
were projected to be 17 percent below its coastwide harvest guideline, but only 3 percent below the harvest guideline
in the Columbia subarea (which is 1,000 mt lower in 1994). Further reductions were implemented in December 1993 (58
FR 64169, December 6, 1993) but were not expected to substantially reduce these overages. Throughout the year, no
more than 5,000 pound (2,268 kg) of sablefish per trip could be smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex is 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) per month, including no more than
30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) of thornyheads and 12,000 pounds (5,443 kg) of trawl-caught sablefish. The cumulative
period is lengthened from 4-weeks to calendar month. The sablefish trip limit of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) or 25 percent
of the DTS complex, whichever is greater, that applies to each trip, remains in effect. The 5,000-pound (2,268 kg)
trip limit on sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) also continues. Even though the sablefish harvest guideline
applies only to the Vancouver, Columbia, Eureka, and Monterey areas, these trip limits are applied coastwide to avoid
effort shifts into the Conception area.

Nontrawl trip limits for sablefish. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, a coastwide 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit was applied until May 9, the beginning of the 72-hour closure
before the start of the regular season on May 12. The 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit was reimposed on June 5 following
a 72-hour closure beginning June 2. Landings are projected to be within one percent of the harvest guideline in 1993.
The harvest guideline applies coastwide except for the Conception subarea.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily trip limits are established again in 1994, until 72 hours before, and 72 hours after, the regular season which
is scheduled to start on May 15, 1994. However, the 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit will apply only to the Vancouver,
Columbia, Eureka, and Monterey subareas, the same areas covered by the harvest guideline. In the Conception area,
where there is no harvest guideline and landings have been below the 425 mt ABC, the daily trip limit is increased to
350 pounds (159 kg). This limit will accommodate most current landings without encouraging excessive effort shifts
into that area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trip limit for sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (1,500 pounds (680 kg) or 3 percent of all legal sablefish
on board, whichever is greater) remains in effect.

and after the regular season. In 1994, the regular season begins on March 1 between 42

Open-access fishery. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its November meeting, the Council recommended open-access fishery trip limits for certain gear types, areas,
and species or species groups. For all open-access gear except trawls, the Council recommended: (1) A 10,000 pound
(4,536 kg) trip limit for all rockfish, not to exceed 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative in a month; and (2) a sablefish
trip limit of the same amounts and areas as for the limited-entry nontrawl fishery at the beginning of the year (250
pounds (113 kg) per day north of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude; 350 pounds (159 kg) per day south of 36
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. latitude). For shrimp trawls, the trip limit for spot and ridgeback prawns remains the same at 1,000 pounds
(454 kg) of groundfish per trip, and the trip limit in the pink shrimp fishery (1,500 pounds (680 kg) of groundfish per
day times the number of days in the fishing trip) is the same except the exclusion of whiting, shortbelly rockfish,
and arrowtooth flounder is removed. The trip limits all are designed to keep landings within the open-access allocation
for as long as possible during the year. In addition, any more restrictive limits imposed on the limited-entry vessels
also apply to the open-access vessels. In particular, the cumulative monthly limits for bocaccio and for yellowtail
rockfish are more restrictive than the 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative limit on all rockfish in the open-access
fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment resulting from the discussion of trip limits at the September 1993 Council meeting revealed two minor
trawl fisheries for non-groundfish species (California halibut and sea cucumbers south of Point Arena, California)
that incidentally take small amounts of groundfish. If these vessels had landed the 500-pound (227 kg) minimum landing
requirement during the window period, they would have qualified for a limited-entry permit, but they did not. These
vessels are considered to be using exempt gears, and therefore may participate in the open-access fishery. The Council
agreed that the total take of groundfish in these fisheries was insignificant, if measurable, and that there was no
need to force these fishers to discard incidentally-caught groundfish. Therefore, a 500-pound (227 kg) trip limit
for all groundfish species was recommended for these fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessels using open-access gear are subject to the management measures for the open-access fishery, whether or not
the vessel has a valid limited-entry permit endorsed for any other gear. In addition, a vessel operating in the open-access
fishery must not exceed any trip limit, frequency limit, and/or size limit for the same gear and/or subarea in the limited-entry
fishery (as announced in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice in paragraphs titled ``limited-entry''). A vessel that operates in both the open-access and limited-entry
fisheries is not entitled to two separate trip limits for the same species. Fish caught with open-access gear will
also be counted toward the limited-entry trip limit. For example; In one month, a trawl vessel catches 12,000 pounds
(5,443 kg) of yellowtail rockfish in the limited-entry fishery, and in the same month catches 4,000 pounds (1,814
kg) of yellowtail rockfish using hook-and-line (open-access) gear. Because the open-access landings are counted
toward the limited-entry limit, the vessel would have exceeded its monthly 14,000 pound (6,350 kg) limited-entry
limit for yellowtail rockfish by 2,000 pounds (907 kg).

III. 1994 Management Measures_Recreational Fishery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recreational size and bag limits in 1994 are the same as in 1993 except for the bag limit for black rockfish off Oregon.
The State of Oregon is concerned that numbers of black rockfish on the north Oregon coast are declining and has reduced
the State bag limit from 15 rockfish of any species, to 15 rockfish of which no more than 10 may be black rockfish. The
Council recommended that the same change be made to the bag limit in Federal waters to conserve the species and maintain
consistency with Oregon regulations. The commercial fishery is not restricted at this time because the commercial
catch of black rockfish is low, and commercial vessels have voluntarily agreed to avoid the nearshore areas where
black rockfish are found.

IV. Secretarial Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated above, the Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendations and announces the following
management actions for 1994, including those that have not been changed since 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Definitions and Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following definitions and provisions apply to the 1994 management measures, unless otherwise specified in a
subsequent notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A trip limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex, by weight, or by percentage of fish on board,
that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel from a single fishing trip.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A daily trip limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in 24 consecutive hours, starting
at 0001 hours local time. Only one landing of groundfish may be made in that 24-hour period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A cumulative trip limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, without
a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 initially apply to calendar months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Unless the fishery is closed, a vessel which has landed its cumulative or daily limit may continue to fish on the
limit for the next legal period so long as the fish are not landed (offloaded) until the next legal period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All weights are round weights or round weight equivalents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Percentages are based on round weights, and, unless otherwise specified, apply only to legal fish on board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Legal fish means fish taken and retained, possessed, or landed in accordance with the provisions of 50 CFR part
663, the Magnuson Act, any notice issued under subpart B of part 663, and any other regulation promulgated or permit
issued under the Magnuson Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Closure, when referring to closure of a fishery, means that taking and retaining, possessing or landing the particular
species or species group is prohibited. (See the regulations at 50 CFR 663.2.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The fishery management area for these species is the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between
3 and 200 nautical miles offshore, and bounded on the north by the Provisional International Boundary between the
United States and Canada, and bounded on the south by the International Boundary between the United States and Mexico.
All groundfish possessed 0&hyph;200 nautical miles offshore, or landed in, Washington, Oregon, or California are
presumed to have been taken and retained from the fishery management area, unless otherwise demonstrated by the person
in possession of those fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Inseason changes to trip limits are announced by notices published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information concerning changes to trip limits also is available from the NMFS Northwest and Southwest regional offices

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES

 above]. Changes to trip limits are effective at the times stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices. Once a change is effective, it is illegal to take and retain, possess, or land more fish than allowed under
the new trip limit.

(11) It is unlawful for any person to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish in excess of the landing limit for
the open-access fishery without having a valid limited-entry permit for the vessel affixed with a gear endorsement
for the gear used to catch the fish. (50 CFR 663.7(t))

The States of Oregon and Washington are implementing declaration procedures that enable a vessel that fishes or transits
both north and south of Cape Lookout during a month to retain the 30,000 pound (13,608 kg) cumulative limit for yellowtail
rockfish south of Cape Lookout. For any vessel that takes and retains or lands yellowtail rockfish during the month,
a declaration must be filed for each fishing trip that crosses the line at Cape Lookout during that month, must be made
before leaving port on the fishing trip, and may not be changed once the vessel has left port. Declarations must be made,
according to State law, to the state where the fish will be landed. To make a declaration or for further information,
contact: Washington Department of Fisheries, Montesano, WA, at 206&hyph;249&hyph;4628; or Oregon Department
of Fish and Wildlife, Newport, OR, at 503&hyph;867&hyph;4741.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A vessel under a northern trip declaration may not exceed the northern limit during a single trip, nor may the cumulative
catch of all northern declared trips exceed the northern cumulative limit. The total cumulative catch for the month
may not exceed the southern limit, no matter where the fish are caught.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A vessel under a southern trip declaration may not fish for any groundfish north of Cape Lookout during the fishing
trip for which the declaration is made; otherwise, the northern trip limit would apply. A vessel under a southern trip
declaration may not exceed the southern trip limit during a single trip, nor may the cumulative catch of all southern
declared trips exceed the southern cumulative limit. The total cumulative catch for the month may not exceed the southern
limit, no matter where the fish are caught.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If any vessel is used to fish south of Cape Mendocino during the month, then the vessel is subject to the trip limit
for bocaccio taken and retained south of Cape Mendocino, no matter where the fish are possessed or landed. Similarly,
if a vessel is used to take and retain bocaccio north of Cape Mendocino and possesses or lands bocaccio south of Cape
Mendocino, that vessel is subject to the southern trip limit.

 An estimate will be made of the catch to the end of 1994 for the Washington coastal treaty tribes. It is anticipated that
these tribes will regulate their fisheries so as not to exceed their estimated catch. There will be no Federally imposed
tribal allocation or quota. In 1994, the estimated tribal catch is 300 mt, the same as in 1991, 1992, and 1993.

 The 1994 harvest guideline for sablefish is 7,000 mt. The 300-mt tribal-imposed catch limit is subtracted, and the
limited-entry and open-access allocations are based on the remaining 6,700 mt. The limited-entry allocation for
1994 of 6,070 mt is allocated 3,520 mt (58 percent) to the trawl fishery and 2,550 mt (42 percent) to the nontrawl fishery.
The trawl and nontrawl gear allocations are harvest guidelines in 1994, which means the fishery will be managed so
that the harvest guidelines are not exceeded, but will not necessarily be closed if they are reached.]

The final specifications and management measures for 1994 are issued under the authority of and in accordance with
the regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 611 and 663. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the data necessary for these specifications and management measures comes from the current fishing season.
Because of the timing of the receipt, development, review, and analysis of the fishery information necessary for
setting the initial specifications and management measures, and the need to have these specifications and management
measures in effect at the beginning of the fishing year, there is good cause to waive the publication of proposed specifications
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 30-day comment period on the proposed specifications. Amendment 4 to the FMP, implemented on January 1, 1991,
recognized these timeliness considerations, and set up a system by which the interested public was notified, through

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice and Council mailings of meetings, and of the development of these measures, and was provided the opportunity
to comment during the Council process. The public participated in GMT, Groundfish Advisory Subpanel, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, and Council meetings in August, September, October, and November 1993 that resulted
in these recommendations from the Council. Additional public comments will be accepted for 30 days after publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA will consider all comments made during the public comment period
and may propose modifications as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule is being issued without prior notice and opportunity for public comment, preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is not required and none has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrative Procedure Act requires that publication of an action be made not less than 30 days before its effective
date unless the Secretary finds and publishes with the rule good cause for an earlier effective date. Good cause for
waiving the delay in effectiveness is found if the delay is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public
interest. These specifications announce the harvest goals and the management measures designed to achieve those
harvest goals in 1994. A delay in implementation could compromise the management strategies that are based on the
projected landings from these trip limits. Therefore, a delay in effectiveness is contrary to the public interest
and these actions are effective on January 1, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule amends the regulations governing the Pacific coast groundfish limited-entry fishery to:
(1) Clarify distinctions between holders, owners, and lessees of limited-entry permits in the Pacific coast groundfish
fishery by adding definitions of these terms and making minor corrections consistent with the new definitions; (2)
clarify that shrimp (including spot and ridgeback prawn) trawls, California halibut trawls, and California sea
cucumber trawls are ``exempted gear''; (3) delete trip limits for groundfish taken in the pink shrimp and spot and
ridgeback prawn trawl fisheries; (4) designate trip limits in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries
as ``routine'' management measures; (5) modify the method of calculating allocations for the ``open-access'' fishery;
and (6) clarify that the sablefish ``regular'' season for nontrawl gear only applies to the limited-entry groundfish
fishery. These actions are necessary to make the regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Pacific
Coast Groundfish Fishery (FMP) consistent with Amendment 6 (limited entry) to the FMP, and to improve recordkeeping
and enforcement of regulations in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1992, NOAA promulgated regulations (57 FR 54001) that establish a license limitation limited-entry
program for the Pacific coast commercial groundfish fishery based on the issuance of gear-specific Federal permits
(the ``limited-entry program''). Under the program, permits are initially issued to owners of qualifying vessels.
Permits with type ``A'' gear endorsements are transferrable, and may be leased by one vessel owner to another. The
implementing regulations, codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C, use the terms ``permit holder'' and ``permit owner''
interchangeably, and do not clearly define the relationship between permit owners and permit lessees. This lack
of definition creates potential recordkeeping and enforcement problems. These problems stem from a person being
able to ``own'' a permit, but lease it to someone else. Maintenance of records identifying the permit owner, even if
the permit is currently registered to a lessee, is essential for recording and enforcement purposes. The NMFS records
system is the only place available to officially record permit ownership, and give notice to creditors, purchasers,
encumbrancers, and other interested parties. NMFS itself needs to know who owns the permit in the event it becomes
necessary to take an enforcement action such as sanctioning the permit or collecting a delinquent penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the first clarification made by this interim final rule is to add the following definitions for ``permit
owner,'' ``permit lessee,'' and ``permit holder.'' A ``permit owner'' is defined as the person owning the permit;
a ``permit lessee'' is defined as a person who does not own the permit, but has the right to possess and use it for a designated
period, with reversion to the permit owner; and ``permit holder'' is an umbrella term which includes both ``permit
owners'' and ``permit lessees.'' This rule amends the regulations in multiple paragraphs to use the term ``permit
owner'' rather than ``permit holder'' when appropriate, and to amend the definition of ``owner'' to ``owner of a vessel''
or ``vessel owner'' to distinguish a vessel owner from a ``permit owner.'' These revisions clarify that only permit
owners may transfer a limited-entry permit to a different person, thus not allowing a lessee to transfer the permit
to someone other than the permit owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to administration of the limited-entry program, the terms ``permit holder,'' ``permit owner,'' and
``permit lessee'' are used for ease of understanding only, and do not signify traditional property rights. As stated
in Amendment 6,

Groundfish limited entry permits and endorsements confer a right to participate in the Pacific coast groundfish
fishery with a limited entry gear in accordance with the limited entry system established under the Pacific Coast
Groundfish FMP as modified by this chapter of the FMP (created under Amendment 6) or any future amendment which may
modify or even abolish the limited entry system. The permits and endorsement are also subject to sanctions, including
revocation, as provided by the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. at 1858(g) and 15 CFR part
904, subpart D.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second clarification revises the definition of ``exempted gear'' in the implementing regulations. Section
4.2.1 of the FMP states that exempted gear includes all gears other than groundfish trawl, longline, and fishpot (which
are limited-entry gears). The FMP points out that shrimp trawl gear, a non-groundfish trawl gear, is an exempt gear.
Shrimp trawl gear is not defined in terms of physical attributes, but includes trawl gear used to take pink shrimp,
or spot or ridgeback prawns. Two other trawl fisheries, California halibut and California sea cucumber, also have
been identified as non-groundfish trawl fisheries, which have traditionally landed small quantities of groundfish
as a bycatch. However, the implementing regulations at 50 CFR 663.31 define ``exempted'' gear as all types of fishing
gear except trawl, longline, and trap (or pot) gear, thus inadvertently excluding shrimp, California halibut, and
California sea cucumber trawl gear from participation in the open-access fishery. This action clarifies that ``exempted''
gear includes all gear other than longline, trap, and groundfish trawl gear. Trawl gear used to take pink shrimp, spot
prawns, ridgeback prawns, California halibut, or California sea cucumbers is specifically defined as ``exempted
gear.'' ``Limited-entry gear'' is redefined to include ``groundfish trawl gear'' rather than ``all trawl gear.''
A new definition of ``groundfish trawl gear'' is added to include only trawl gear used under the authority of a valid
Pacific Coast Groundfish limited-entry permit affixed with an endorsement for trawl gear.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third and fourth clarifications address how trip limits are established for groundfish taken in trawl fisheries
for pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries. Trip limits for groundfish in these fisheries have been fixed
in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.24(a) and (b). The trip limits were codified because the Council did not foresee any
future need to revise them under the management regime that existed prior to limited entry. Under Amendment 6, however,
groundfish bycatch in the shrimp and prawn trawl fisheries is managed as a component of the ``open-access'' fishery
because it is taken with ``exempted gear.'' Amendment 6 provides for the establishment of trip limits for bycatch
of groundfish with exempted gear in the open-access fishery to make sure that the total catch of each species and species
group does not exceed the historical catch proportions during the limited-entry qualifying period, and that the
open-access allocations are not exceeded during the fishing year. Because the amount of effort in the open-access
fishery may change over time, Amendment 6 contemplated that trip limits may need frequent revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific coast groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 663.23(c) establish a category of management measures called
``routine.'' Routine measures include the types of management measures, primarily trip limits but also including
trip frequency limits and bag limits in the recreational fishery, that need to be adjusted frequently in order to manage
the fishery consistent with the FMP's goals and objectives. Once a particular management measure has been established
by regulation as ``routine,'' the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) may recommend that the Secretary
adjust that measure at any time, following consideration at a single Council meeting and publication of the adjustment
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provided that the purpose for the adjustment is consistent with the rationale for needing frequent adjustments
that was articulated at the time the management measure was determined to be ``routine.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing regulations for Amendment 6 inadvertently omitted a ``routine'' designation for trip limits for groundfish
in the shrimp and prawn trawl fisheries. The routine designation is necessary in order to limit the open-access catch
of groundfish to its historical catch proportions and to ensure that the annual open-access allocation is not exceeded.
Thus, this rule deletes the trip limits in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries at 50 CFR 663.24(a)
and (b) while simultaneously designating them as ``routine'' under 50 CFR 663.23(c)(2) so that the Council may recommend
adjustments as necessary without undertaking the time-consuming regulatory amendment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the procedures for routine designation, the Council considered the routine designation for trip
limits for pink shrimp and prawns at the September 1993 meeting and recommended the designation at its November 1993
meeting. Rockfish and sablefish trip landing and trip frequency limits for all gear are already designated as routine.
This action clarifies the regulations to include trip landing and frequency limits for rockfish and sablefish in
the open-access as well as the limited-entry portion of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth clarification addresses an inconsistency between how catches in the ``limited-entry'' and ``open-access''
fisheries are accounted for, and how the allocations are calculated for each fishery. 50 CFR 663.32(c) provides that
any groundfish caught by a vessel with a limited-entry permit will be counted against the limited-entry allocation
while the limited-entry fishery for that vessel's limited-entry gear type is open. Thus, for example, while the limited-entry
fishery for groundfish is open, any groundfish taken by a vessel with a limited-entry permit, even if it is fishing
with exempted gear such as shrimp trawl gear, will be counted against the limited-entry allocation. In sections II.E.(d)(3)
and (d)(4)(A)(1) and (2) of the appendix to part 663, the ``open-access'' allocation is derived by applying the open-access
allocation percentage to the annual harvest guideline or quota after subtracting any set asides for recreational
fishing or treaty Indians. The ``open-access allocation percentage'' is calculated by computing the total catch
during the limited-entry qualifying (window) period by longlines and traps (or pots) not initially receiving a limited-entry
endorsement for that gear, and by exempted gear, and dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period
by all gear. Thus, the groundfish catch taken during the window period with exempted gear by a vessel that initially
receives a limited-entry permit will be included in the open-access allocation even though the catch with that same
exempted gear in 1994 and beyond will count against the limited-entry allocation as long as the limited-entry fishery
is open. To rectify this inconsistency, this rule amends the regulations to provide that the window period catch by
vessels not initially receiving limited-entry permits will count toward the ``open-access'' allocation; conversely,
the window period catch with exempted gear by vessels initially receiving a limited-entry permit will count toward
the ``limited-entry'' allocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule clarifies that the ``regular'' season with longline and fish trap (or pot) gear (nontrawl gear)
for sablefish refers only to the ``limited-entry'' fishery. Vessels participating in the ``open-access'' fishery
are not affected by the regular season because they are regulated under open-access trip landing limits which extend
throughout the year.

This rule makes minor changes designed to clarify and facilitate implementation of Amendment 6. NMFS became aware
of the need for these changes while implementing the Pacific coast groundfish limited-entry program, a new and complex
regulatory system. These changes need to be in place when the fishery itself begins to operate under the limited-entry
system on January 1, 1994. Most of the changes effected by this rule are necessary to conform the implementing regulations
to the letter and intent of Amendment 6 to the FMP. As such, these provisions were discussed and were subject to public
comment and scrutiny during the years the Council developed Amendment 6. Furthermore, the revisions and clarifications
are necessary to uniformly administer the program and to ensure accurate recordkeeping. These provisions will not
result in any significant changes in the day-to-day operating practices of the fishery. Accordingly, the Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), that it would be unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to delay the effectiveness of these provisions pending advance notice and comment
and a 30-day delay in effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision of 50 CFR 663.22(d)(1) is the only change that was not necessarily contemplated by Amendment 6; however,
it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide advance notice and comment before the fishery
converts to limited-entry because, without it, permit owners and potential purchasers would be susceptible to substantial
losses if permits could be freely transferred by permit lessees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration
(ESA) of the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) are publishing final regulations governing the filing and enforcement
of attestations by facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered nurses under H&hyph;1A visas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attestations, required under the Immigration and Nationality Act, pertain to substantial disruption in the
delivery of health care services, absence of adverse effect on wages and working conditions of similarly employed
registered nurses, payment of wages to nonimmigrant alien nurses employed by the facility at wage rates paid to other
registered nurses similarly employed by the facility, taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and
retain U.S. nurses in order to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant alien nurses, absence of a strike or lockout, and
giving appropriate notice of filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities are required to submit these attestations to DOL as a condition for being able to petition the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) for H&hyph;1A nurses. The attestation process is administered by ETA, while complaints
and investigations regarding the attestations are handled by ESA.

The Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989 (INRA), Public Law 101&hyph;238, 103 Stat. 2099 (December 18, 1989), amended
the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to add new sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 212(m) governing the admission
to the United States of nonimmigrant aliens for employment as registered nurses (RN's) during a 5-year ``pilot''
period. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1182(m). The provisions which INRA added to the INA were further amended
by section 162(f) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978 (November 29, 1990),
and by section 302(e) (9) and (10) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments
of 1991 (MTINA), Public Law 102&hyph;232, 105 Stat. 1733 (December 12, 1991).

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
The provisions of INRA do not apply to nurses admitted under the free trade agreement with Canada, whose admission
is authorized under section 214(e) of the INA. Under the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the number of Mexican professionals (including registered nurses) entering
the United States pursuant to NAFTA is limited to 5,500 annually. This limit may be increased by agreement between
Mexico and the United States and will expire 10 years after NAFTA enters into effect, unless the two countries decide
to remove the limit earlier. Entry into the United States under these provisions of NAFTA neither forecloses nor establishes
their eligibility for entry under other similar provisions of the INA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As authorized by Paragraph 5(b) of Section D of Annex 1603 of NAFTA, during the period that the transition provisions
of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the NAFTA are in effect, Mexican nurses are subject to the labor attestation requirements
of section 212(m) of the INA. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m); Section 341(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement its responsibilities with respect to the admission of Mexican nurses during the transition
period provided under the NAFTA, the Department will require health care facilities seeking to use the services of
Mexican registered nurses to file H&hyph;1A labor attestations under and pursuant to existing regulations implementing
section 212(m) of the INA, at 20 CFR part 655, subpart D; and 29 CFR part 504, subpart D. Complaints regarding such attestations
will be processed under and pursuant to existing regulations at 20 CFR part 655, subpart E; and 29 CFR part 504, subpart
E. This document amends the applicability section of the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 212(m) of the
INA pertaining to facilities using nonimmigrants as registered nurses under H&hyph;1A visas, to implement the provisions
of NAFTA.

, H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;288, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 1&hyph;4 (October 16, 1989). Some health care facilities had
been relying on nonimmigrant RN's admitted under H&hyph;1 visas to meet this need. However, the numbers of visas available
for such aliens to adjust their immigration status to permanent residency had been limited.

. at 2 and 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of INRA's enactment, many such RN's were approaching the end of their periods of admission to the United
States and faced return to their home countries. Many H&hyph;1 RN's potentially affected by the INRA were thought
to be employed in critical care and emergency service units.

the care provided to critically ill patients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, Congress was concerned about the perceived increased dependence of health care providers on foreign
RN's. As a result, the INA, as amended, links future access to nonimmigrant RN's to the taking of significant steps
by the facility to develop, recruit and retain U.S. workers in the registered nursing profession while ensuring that
the temporary foreign nurses admitted are protected in their employment and that their employment does not adversely
affect the employment of U.S. nurses. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities are required to file attestations with DOL attesting to certain conditions and to steps taken to recruit
and retain U.S. nurses in order to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant alien nurses. Facilities are required to submit
these attestations to DOL as a condition to being able to petition INS for admission of H&hyph;1A nurses. The attestation
process is administered by ETA, while complaints and investigations regarding the attestations are handled by ESA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The INRA-amended portions of the INA were amended by IMMACT to make clear that where nursing contractors are involved,
both the contractor and the worksite facility (other than private households) must file attestations, but granted
the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) some discretion in determining the requirements of the worksite facility attestation.
MTINA further amended the INA to clarify Congressional intent concerning the ``no lay off'' provision, to specify
that a facility that has laid off a nurse other than a staff nurse still meets the ``no lay off'' requirement, if it attests
that it will not replace the nurse with an H&hyph;1A nurse for 1 year after the lay off.

B. Attestation Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The INA requires a health care facility seeking access to temporary foreign RN's (under the H&hyph;1A visa category)
to file an ``attestation'' with the Department of Labor (DOL or Department) on an annual basis. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a)
and 1182(m)(2)(A) and (C). This includes worksites (except private households) seeking to use the services of an
H&hyph;1A nurse through a nursing contractor. See IMMACT section 162(f). The attestation must assure that the following
six statutory criteria are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There would be a substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services
of the facility without the services of such alien(s). A facility is not considered to meet this clause if, within the
previous year, it laid off RN's, unless such RN's were other than staff nurses and the facility has attested that it
will not replace them with H&hyph;1A visa nurses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The employment of the alien(s) will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of RN's similarly employed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The alien(s) employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for RN's similarly employed by the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The facility has taken and is taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient RN's
who are United States citizens or immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as
quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant RN's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The facility is subject to an approved State plan for the recruitment and retention of nurses (see 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment of such alien(s) is not intended
or designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for RN's of the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) At the time of the filing of the petition for RN's, notice of the filing has been provided by the facility to the bargaining
representative of the RN's at the facility or, where there is none, notice of the filing has been provided to RN's employed
at the facility through posting in conspicuous locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A)(i) through (vi).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the following is a ``significant step'' reasonably designed to recruit and retain RN's (see Item (4)(a) above):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Operating of training program for RN's at the facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training
program for RN's elsewhere;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become RN's;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Paying RN's wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to RN's similarly employed in the geographic area;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Providing adequate support services to free RN's from administrative and other non-nursing duties; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by RN's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(B) (i) through (v); see 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A)(iv)(I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Items (i) through (v) above are not an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the requirements
of the fourth attestations element, and a facility is not required to take more than one step if the facility can demonstrate
than taking a second step is not reasonable. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special rules apply to cases where an alien nurse, for whom an employer has filed an attestation, is performing services
at a worksite other than the employer's worksite or other than a worksite controlled by the employer. In cases of temporary,
emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good
cause, the Secretary may waive such requirements for the attestation for the worksite as the Secretary may determine
are appropriate, in order to avoid duplicative attestations. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A) (as amended by section 162(f)(2)(B)(iii)
of IMMACT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These attestations (and visa petitions supported by them) are available for public examination in the Employment
and Training Administration (ETA) National Office in Washington, D.C. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E)(i). The Department
also informs the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) which attestations have been accepted. The employer
must furnish evidence to INS that the Department has accepted its attestation for filing as a prerequisite for INS
approving a petition to bring in foreign RN's under H&hyph;1A visas (which visas are issued by the U.S. Department
of State (DOS)). 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, DOL's administrative functions under the INRA include, with certain limited exceptions, receiving
and accepting attestations for filing, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
checking that the attestation form is properly completed and that the required explanatory statements are provided.
DOL reviews elements of attestations in only four instances: (1) the facility attests to a ``non-standards'' indicator
of substantial disruption (Element I); (2) the facility takes as one of its two steps a ``non-standard'' timely and
significant step (Element IV); (3) the facility attests that taking a second timely and significant step under Element
IV would not be reasonable; and (4) the facility is not an employer of H&hyph;1A nurses and is claiming a bona fide medical
emergency as the basis for requesting a waiver of one or more of the attestation elements. The Department also makes
the accepted attestations available for public inspection, and notifies INS of those attestations that DOL has on
file. These administration functions are delegated, by regulation, to ETA.

C. Complaints, Investigations and Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also authorized to investigate allegations that a facility has failed to meet the conditions attested
to or that a facility has misrepresented a material fact in an attestation. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E) (ii) through (v).
If violations are found, DOL may impose administrative remedies, including civil money penalties (CMP's); shall
notify the Attorney General, who shall not approve H&hyph;1A petitions for a period of at least 1 year for the facility;
shall obtain back wages; and may impose other remedies. These activities constitute the Department's enforcement
functions under the INRA. Under the regulations, the enforcement functions are delegated to the Department's Employment
Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and Hour Division.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, pursuant to the INRA, the Secretary appointed an advisory group which includes representatives of DOL,
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General, hospitals, and labor organizations representing
RN's. Pub. L. 101&hyph;238 section 3(c)(2), 103 Stat. at 2103.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the INRA, the advisory group advises the Secretary on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The impact of this legislation on the nursing shortage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Programs that health care facilities may implement to recruit and retain U.S. RN's, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State recruitment and retention plans, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The advisability of extending the law beyond the current 5-year duration of this pilot program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advisory group operates under the auspices of the DOL Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy.

E. Operating Experience
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1990, an interim final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to implement the Department's responsibilities relating to attestations by facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant
aliens as registered nurses. 55 FR 50500. This interim final rule incorporated many of the comments the Department
received on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which was published in the July 6, 1990, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 55 FR 27992; see also 55 FR 30720 (July 27, 1990). The interim final rule went into effect on the date it was published
and established a comment period that ended February 4, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking was the Department's first experience with defining and implementing an attestation process. The
interim final rule required attestations to be filed in the ETA National Office to allow it to gain operating experience
in this new process. The final rule published below decentralizes the processing of H&hyph;1A attestations to four
ETA regional offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attestation includes a completed Form ETA 9029 and accompanying statements that explain briefly how the facility
complies with the various attestation elements and describe the documentation available at the facility that demonstrates
compliance. In the case of facilities attesting to ``other'' indicators of substantial disruption, ``other'' timely
and significant steps, the unreasonableness of taking more than one timely and significant step, and/or a bona fide
medical emergency, the attestation must also include more detailed information describing how the prescribed standards
are being met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attesting facilities are required to maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate compliance with the statutory
and regulatory standards for each of the attestation elements. The attestation, along with supporting documentation,
must be maintained by the facility on site in a separate file. The file shall also contain visa petitions supported
by the attestation. Any interested party may request to see this file. The facility is required to make all of the information
in the file available within 72 hours of receiving a request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ETA has provided for a 30-day time period to determine whether an attestation can be accepted for filing. All attestations
are examined to ensure that the Form ETA 9029 is properly completed and that the explanatory statements contain the
required information. In the case of facilities attesting to ``other'' indicators of substantial disruption, ``other''
timely and significant steps, the unreasonableness of taking more than one timely and significant step, or a bona
fide medical emergency, the explanatory information is reviewed to ensure that the prescribed standards are being
met. Attestations which meet the established criteria are accepted for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time the interim final rule was promulgated, ETA estimated that approximately 1,000 facilities per year would
be submitting attestations. Experience has proven this estimate to be too low. Approximately 1,500 facilities submitted
attestations the first year the H&hyph;1A attestation process was in effect. Approximately 1,400 facilities submitted
attestations during the 1992 fiscal year. It should be noted, however, that the number of attestations received was
substantially larger than the number of facilities submitting attestations, because many facilities submitted
attestations that were returned as unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As employers' experience with the 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;&blank;H&hyph;1A program has increased, the proportion of attestations that ETA returns because they are
unacceptable for filing has decreased from 43 percent to the current level of 23 percent. The two most common reasons
why ETA is not able to accept attestations for filing are that the Form ETA 9029 is not properly completed and the required
explanatory statements are not included with the submission. ETA returns unacceptable attestations to the facility
with a letter explaining why the attestation cannot be accepted for filing. The facility may file a new attestation
which corrects the deficiencies. There are no restrictions on how frequently they may be refiled. Most facilities
which have submitted attestations not accepted for filing continue to refile their attestations until they are accepted
for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 70 percent of the attestations have been submitted by health care facilities located in six States_California,
New York, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois, and Florida. Approximately 90 percent of the attestations received have been
submitted by three types of facilities: about 62 percent by acute care facilities; 22 percent by long-term care facilities;
and 6 percent by nursing contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was estimated in the interim final rule that 10 notices of strikes or lockouts and 10 annual State plans would be submitted
per year. However, ETA has received notice from an attesting facility of a strike that lasted 1 day. ETA has not received
any annual State plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 6, 1990, invited comments through February 4, 1991. 55 FR 50500. comments were received from 21 organizations
and individuals, including employers and employer associations, labor organizations, a nurse association, a commission,
an attorney association, two individual attorneys, one Member of Congress, and one State employment security agency
(SESA). The 41 comments received on the NPRM were discussed at 55 FR 50501&hyph;50504 and are further discussed in
pertinent part below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The labor organizations and other organizations representing the interests of registered nurses asserted that
the interim final rule did not offer U.S. nurses the protection offered in the proposed rule, while the attorneys and
commenters representing the interests of employers asserted that the interim final rule did not go far enough in ``streamlining''
the attestation process. See 55 FR 27992 (July 6, 1990); and 55 FR 30720 (July 27, 1990). Some commenters stated that
the Department had been successful in addressing concerns that the proposed definition of ``nurse'' did not take
into consideration the differences among State governments in defining nursing duties and practices and did not
clearly state that foreign nurses who have not been licensed by State nursing boards must have passed the Commission
on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) Examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major concerns expressed by commenters on the interim final rule included: the type of and location for retention
of supporting documentation; the waiver provisions; DOL's role in reviewing attestations; the definition of ``facility'';
and the indicators of substantial disruption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the comments received on the interim final rule, as well as those comments received on the proposed rule that
may not have been fully addressed in the interim final rule, have been reviewed and considered in preparing this final
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Location for Retention of Supporting Documentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three labor organizations and one Member of Congress commented that supporting documentation should be available
at DOL, as well as at the facility. The attorneys commented that only the Form ETA 9029 should be submitted to DOL and
that the requirement concerning the accompanying explanatory statements should be removed in the final rule. Two
employer associations commented in support of the interim final rule provisions which require the attestor to maintain
the supporting documentation at the facility, but these commenters wanted the rule to be more specific about the explanatory
statements to be submitted with the Form ETA 9029.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the interim final rule, ETA found the comments offered by Former Representative Bruce
Morrison, then Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International
Law when INRA was passed, and one of the principal authors of the legislation, to be very persuasive. In commenting
on the proposed rule, Representative Morrison voiced his support for the kinds of supporting documentation required,
and indicated that the intent of a streamlined attestation process would best be served by keeping the amount of documentation
filed with the attestation to a minimum, and requiring the bulk of it to be retained at the facility. (The preamble to
the interim final rule also pointed out that the Office of Management and Budget in its official comments to the Department
on the paperwork burden stated that there should be a streamlined attestation process.) See 55 FR at 50502.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments received during this rulemaking concerning the location for retention of supporting
documentation, and considering the fact that the comments received from Representative Morrison and OMB are consistent
with a ``complaint driven process'' for investigating and resolving complaints, the Department has decided to retain
the interim final rule's provisions concerning the location of the supporting documentation. The facility must
submit to DOL only a brief statement of what documentation is available at the facility to demonstrate compliance
with the various attestation elements. The full documentation must be retained at the facility for the duration of
the attestation period, and for as long thereafter as the facility continues to employ an H&hyph;1A nurse hired under
the attestation. Further, the facility must attest that the documentation will be available for public examination
within 72 hours of receiving a request. Failure to provide access may be the basis for a complaint as a ``failure to perform.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. DOL Authority To Review Attestations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney commenting on the interim final rule questioned whether DOL has the authority to review any H&hyph;1A
attestations, and an employer and an attorney association commented that the DOL role in reviewing attestations
should be reduced. However, two of the labor organizations submitting comments voiced concern that the interim final
rule weakened DOL's role in reviewing attestations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule prescribed a substantial review function by DOL. As indicated in the preamble to the interim final
rule, ETA found the comments of Representative Morrison and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, highly persuasive. Both Representative Morrison
and Senator Kennedy expressed the view that the proposed DOL review function was greater than that intended by the
legislation. This was also the view expressed by many health care facility commenters. See 55 FR at 50502. In response
to these comments, the interim final rule substantially restricted the DOL review function. As indicated above,
DOL reviews elements of attestations in only four instances. For all other attestations, the DOL function is limited
to checking that the attestation Form ETA 9029 is properly completed, the required explanatory statements are included,
and the facility is attesting to compliance with the regulatory standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has concluded that the provisions governing DOL's review function, set forth in the interim final
rule should be retained. After a careful review of the comments received both on the proposed rule and on the interim
final rule, considering that only minimal documentation is submitted, and, in view of the fact that the H&hyph;1A
program relies on a ``complaint driven process'' for investigating and resolving complaints, DOL has determined
that no further change in this provision is warranted.

3. Indicators of Substantial Disruption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 10 comments concerning the indicators of substantial disruption under Attestation Element
One. One attorney commented that the rule should not be more specific than the legislation in addressing ``substantial
disruption''; and an employer commented that a simple description of the steps taken to fill vacant nursing positions
should suffice as evidence that there would be a substantial disruption without the services of nonimmigrant alien
nurses. In contrast, one employer commented that the requirement that a facility document its recruiting efforts
does not belong in the section of the regulations dealing with substantial disruption. The employer also commented
that the documentation requirements under &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(3) should be limited to the total number of nursing vacancies and the total number of H&hyph;1A nurses employed
at the time the attestation is submitted. Other commenters recommended adding more specific requirements to &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(2) and allowing facilities to count as vacant all positions encumbered by H&hyph;1A nurses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INRA was enacted to allow facilities to use nonimmigrant alien nurses temporarily to help alleviate substantial
disruptions in health care services, while requiring that facilities take steps designed to develop, recruit and
retain a trained U.S. workforce as the long-term solution to the current nursing shortage. One of the legislatively-mandated
elements that a facility must attest to in order to have its attestation accepted by DOL is a substantial disruption
in health care services due to a shortage of nurses (absent the services of the nonimmigrant alien nurses on whose behalf
they are petitioning).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule listed four possible indicators of substantial disruption. These indicators were identified
by organizations representing both employers and nurses as being those most commonly experienced throughout the
health care industry. However, this provision was not intended to be an exhaustive list. When a facility finds that
the indicators of substantial disruption listed in the regulations cannot be demonstrated or that such indicators
are inappropriate to that facility, the facility may propose an alternative indicator of substantial disruption
under the ``other'' category. A facility attesting to an ``other'' indicator of substantial disruption is required
to provide an explanation which clearly shows a substantial disruption in the delivery of specific health care services
due to a shortage of nurses. For example, a facility that has a large number of H&hyph;1A nurses with visas that will
be expiring within the next 12 months may be able to demonstrate that it will experience a substantial disruption if
it cannot petition INS for extensions of stay and/or new H&hyph;1A nurses. Such a facility may choose to attest to an
``other'' indicator substantial disruption. The facility would then be required to demonstrate that it has made
conscientious efforts to recruit and retain U.S. nurses but has a history of being able to fill only a small percentage
of its vacancies with U.S. nurses, and that it projects a vacancy rate of at least 7 percent, if it cannot continue to
petition INS for H&hyph;1A nurses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOL has determined that the four indicators of substantial disruption listed in the interim final rule, coupled with
the ``other'' indicator of substantial disruption, strike the proper balance in addressing the concerns raised
in the comments. These indicators satisfy the need for standardized criteria that can be used by facilities in determining
whether they qualify to file an attestation and by DOL in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities. Therefore,
they have been retained in this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on its operating experience, the Department has determined that a brief explanatory statement is
not necessary if the employer attests to a vacancy rate of 7 percent or more, or to an unutilized bed rate of 7 percent
or more. The employer is still required to maintain supporting documentation and to make it available for review at
the facility in accordance with &sect;

4. No Adverse Effect
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A nurses' association, a labor organization, and one Member of Congress submitted comments endorsing the Department's
approach to determining no adverse effect on wages. The labor organization and the Member of Congress advocated using
the same approach to determining whether there would be no adverse effect on working conditions. A nationwide employer
organization and a statewide employer association both commented that the rule should state that the wage need only
be the lowest point on the prevailing wage range since most H&hyph;1A nurses start out in entry-level positions. One
attorney commented that facilities should not be required to get prevailing wage determinations prior to filing
their attestations, and another attorney and an attorney association commented that the prevailing wage requirement
should be deleted entirely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments received, the Department has determined that there will be no substantive
changes made to the interim final rule's requirements concerning no adverse effect on wages and working conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement concerning no adverse effect on wages is statutory and, as such, cannot be removed from the regulations.
As pointed out in the preamble to the interim final rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The phrase ``not adversely affect the wages'' is a well established legal term of art that has been used for decades
in alien labor certification programs, with a very specific meaning of at least the area prevailing wage for the occupation
*&blank;*&blank;*. Presumably Congress was aware of this meaning in incorporating this language in the INRA. [55
FR at 50506.]
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prevailing wage rate is derived by averaging the wages paid by a sample of facilities in the geographic area. If
the prevailing wage determination was not obtained prior to submitting the attestation, the facility would not have
the knowledge needed to determine whether it could truthfully attest to paying each nurse it employs at least the prevailing
wage for the geographic area, nor would it be able to attest to having the supporting documentation available at the
facility for examination by interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating experience has indicated that clarification is desirable as to how far in advance a health care facility
can obtain the prevailing wage from the SESA. Some facilities have allowed an inordinate amount of time to elapse between
obtaining a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and filing an appropriate attestation. Since prevailing
wage surveys and determinations are frequently updated by SESA's, to minimize the possibility of adverse effect
on the wages of U.S. registered nurses the prevailing wage determination should be reasonably contemporaneous with
the filing of the attestation. To assure that the prevailing wage determination supporting the attestation is current
the regulation at 20 CFR 655.310(e)(1)(i) has been amended to require filing of the attestation within 90 days of the
date the prevailing wage request was submitted to the SESA by the facility.

XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(e)(1)(i) of the interim final rule requires that a facility obtain a prevailing wage determination from the
SESA. Although the SESA and ETA administrative system provide an avenue for a facility to challenge a SESA determination
through the Employment Service (ES) complaint process (see 20 CFR part 658, subpart E), the interim final rule did
not specifically identify that process. The final rule provides needed clarification by directing the facility
to the ES complaint process and alerting the facility that a challenge of a SESA determination may be made only prior
to filing an attestation in which that SESA determination is used. Implicit and essential in this process is the requirement
that once a facility obtains a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and files the attestation without challenging
the SESA's determination through the ES complaint system, the facility has in effect accepted the determination
and waived its right to challenge the determination. Permitting a facility to operate under a determination and later
contest it in the course of an investigation or enforcement action is contrary to sound public policy; such a delayed,
disruptive challenge would have a harmful effect on U.S. and H&hyph;1B nurses, competing hospitals, and other parties
who may have relied on the wage provided by the facility on the attestation. Section &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(3)(1)(i) of the final rule explicitly states the Department's clarification of the use and consequence of the
ES complaint process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding working conditions, the final rule, as did the interim final rule, applies an adverse effect standard on
a facility basis, due to the administrative infeasibility of making prevailing practice determinations on an area-wide
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the documentation requirements for pay and compensation, a Member of Congress commented that the interim
final rule did not require specific enough documentation. He suggested that the rule should require specific wage
and job data for individual nurses and positions, not summaries. However, a statewide employer association expressed
concern that the interim final rule made confidential information available to the public. This commenter suggested
that such information should be available only to the Department of Labor and/or others as hospital policy allows.
Former Representative Morrison, in commenting on the NPRM, which contained documentation requirements much like
the interim final rule, voiced his support for the kinds of supporting documentation required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments received, the Department has determined that there will be no changes
made to the interim final rule's requirements concerning documentation of no adverse effect on wages and working
conditions. Employers should note that if a complaint is filed, an investigation conducted, and a hearing held, any
employer information submitted as evidence for the hearing will become a matter of public record. Such information
may well be more extensive than that which the employer must make available for public examination. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E).

5. Notification of Strike or Lockout
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One employer commented that the requirement that the facility notify ETA within 3 days of the occurrence of a strike
or lockout at the facility involving registered nurses should be changed to allow the facility 10 days to notify ETA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that the current requirement that ETA be notified within 3 days of the occurrence of
a strike or lockout provides the facility with adequate time for making the required notification, since the facility
will be aware of any such occurrence immediately. The current protections offered to U.S. nurses would be weakened
if the 3-day notification period were lengthened. Therefore, no change is being made in the requirements governing
notification of strike or lockout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Notification of Filing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney commented that the requirement that facilities notify their employees when they file an attestation
is burdensome to employers and goes beyond what is in the statute. The attorney recommended that facilities be required
to provide notice only of the filing of H&hyph;1A visa petitions with INS and only from the time of filing until the alien
begins work. The attorney also commented that the current requirement concerning the availability for public examination
of the supporting documentation goes beyond what should be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While INRA amendments to the INA call for notice of filing when the visa petition is filed, the accompanying House Judiciary
Committee report on INRA (then called H.R. 3259) recommending that the bill pass without amendment, stated on page
5 that:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he facility is required to provide notice of filing of an attestation to various labor representatives or to post
a notice in a conspicuous location. The Committee believes that notice of filing is an important element of the new
procedure, particularly in view of the fact that this is one of two mechanisms available for U.S. nurses to monitor
the admission of foreign nurses and its possible effect on their employment situation. [H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;288,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that the notice requirements are consistent with the intent of Congress that all aspects
of the process should be open to public review. Additionally, this approach is necessary to facilitate the complaint
and investigative process that is called for in the INA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received numerous comments critical of the interim final rule's provisions concerning waivers of
certain attestation elements. Such waivers may be requested by facilities which are not themselves employers of
H&hyph;1A nurses, but which use H&hyph;1A nurses employed by contractors. Three labor organizations opposed the
interim final rule's waiver provisions. One of these organizations expressed opposition to allowing any waivers,
while another commented that the provisions go beyond the statute and allow for circumvention of legislative intent.
One Member of Congress commented that waivers for temporary emergency situations should be very narrow and for a short
period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One attorney commented that the waiver provisions should be expanded so that facilities only using H&hyph;1A nurses
employed by contractors would not be required to file an attestation. Such a broad waiver would go beyond the scope
of the statute. The Secretary only has the discretion to waive attestations for worksites using nonimmigrant nurses
employed by contractors ``to avoid duplicate attestations in cases of temporary circumstances, with respect to
information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause.'' Section 212(m)(2)(A) of the INA as
amended by section 162(f)(2)(B)(iii) of IMMACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has carefully considered the comments concerning the waiver provisions set forth in the interim final
rule. With the above one exception, none of the commenters made any specific recommendations for revisions to these
provisions which would address the concerns raised. No need or basis for revisions are indicated by the Department's
operational experience, the Department has received very few requests for waivers during the 2 years the program
has been in operation. Therefore, for the above reasons, no changes have been made to this section in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney organization commented that contractors should not be required to comply with each attestation element.
The commenter suggested that, at most, they should be required to attest that their employees will be paid at a rate
equal to the rate for nurses similarly employed by the facility where they are placed. The Department does not have
the authority to make such a change. Amendments to the INA by IMMACT require that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the contractor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the worksite facility (other than private households) file attestations. These amendments grant the Secretary
discretion to determine the requirements of the attestation filed by the worksite facility, but they do not grant
the Department the authority to waive any attestation elements for contractors. To the contrary, IMMACT amended
the INA to make clear that, where nursing contractors are involved, both the contractor and the worksite facility
(other than private households) must file attestations.

9. Definition of ``Facility''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One labor organization commented in support of the definition of ``facility'' set forth in the interim final rule,
which requires an employer with multiple sites to file an individual attestation for each site unless the sites are
in reasonable geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. On
the other hand, one employer and an attorney recommended that a multi-site employer should be allowed to file a single
attestation so long as the same employer controls each worksite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOL carefully considered this multi-site issue during the development of both the NPRM and the interim final rule
and determined that any advantages of a ``single attestation'' would be offset by the problems it would cause. Area
prevailing wage rates would be different for sites in different geographic areas. Entities would be significantly
increasing the vulnerability of their entire system to suspension from the program, should one of their sites incur
a violation or should a lay off of nurses occur at only one of their sites. It should be noted, however, that multi-site
entities may develop materials that could be used by all of their sites, with perhaps some minor modifications. See
55 FR at 50504.

10. State Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters stated that the section dealing with State plans for the recruitment and retention of nurses should
be expanded. One labor organization commented that the regulations need to specify that a State may use a State plan
to impose obligations on a facility that go beyond those that would be applicable in the absence of a State plan. One
Member of Congress commented that the regulations should specify that the list of eight components of a State plan
is not an exhaustive list and that States should be encouraged to develop additional components. An employer association
commented that the regulations should include the criteria that will be used for determining whether to approve State
plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the Department has received no State plans. All of the changes suggested by the commenters would make the section
dealing with State plans more restrictive. The Department believes that any additional restrictions would further
discourage States from developing and implementing State plans. Therefore, no revision has been made to this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

11. Definitions of ``U.S. Nurse'' and ``U.S. Worker''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions of ``United States (U.S.) nurse'' and ``United States (U.S.) worker'' in the interim final rule include
U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, permanent resident aliens, and temporary resident aliens. A Member of Congress commented
that refugees and asylees should be included in both of these definitions, since refugees and asylees are lawfully
in the U.S., are allowed to work for an indefinite period of time, and there is nothing in the statute that excludes them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments received from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices
(OSC) of the Department of Justice during the rulemaking process implementing the IMMACT amendments to the permanent
labor certification program, the definition of ``U.S. worker'' for the purposes of that program was amended to include
within that definition ``protected individuals'' under the INA's unfair immigration-related employment practices
provision. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3); see 56 FR 54920, 54926 (October 23, 1991); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)(A); and 20
CFR part 656. To meet the definition of a ``protected individual'', one must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an
alien in one of four citizenship status categories: (1) permanent resident; (2) temporary resident (including seasonal
and replenishment agricultural workers); (3) refugee; or (4) asylee. To remain a ``protected individual'', these
aliens must complete the naturalization process within a specified period of time. Protected individuals can work
indefinitely in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The H&hyph;1A interim final rule's definitions of ``U.S. nurse'' and ``U.S. worker'' included all ``protected individuals''
except refugees and asylees. To have consistent definitions of the term ``U.S. worker'' in the certification and
attestation programs administered by DOL, the definitions of ``U.S. nurse'' and ``U.S. worker'' have been clarified
and amended in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

12. Layoff Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
INRA amended the INA to provide that a facility cannot meet the first attestation element, relating to a substantial
disruption in the delivery of health care services, if, within the past 12 months it has laid off any registered nurses.
In the interim final rule the Department interpreted this statutory provision to cover lay offs of all individuals
who are licensed registered nurses, regardless of the positions they held within the health care facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MTINA amended the INA to clarify Congressional intent regarding lay offs, by specifying that a facility which has
laid off a registered nurse other than a staff nurse still meets the ``no layoff'' requirement, if, in its attestation,
the facility attests that it will not replace the nurse with an H&hyph;1A nurse (either through promotion or otherwise)
for a period of 1 year after the date of the layoff. In the final rule, section &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(1) has been revised to incorporate this statutory amendment. The definition of ``layoff'' in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.302 has been revised to specify that if staff nurses are separated from one specialized activity, the retraining
and retention they are offered must be in another activity involving direct patient care at the same facility in order
for their separation not to be considered a ``layoff'', and a sentence has been expanded to indicate that a ``staff
nurse'' means a nurse who provides nursing care directly to patients Item 8.a(i) on the Form ETA 9029 has also been modified
to reflect the amendment to the ``no layoff'' provision.

G. Technical and Clarifying Amendments in Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Decentralization to the Regional Offices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule required that attestations be submitted to the ETA National Office. This was done as a temporary
measure, in order to allow the National Office, which is responsible for establishing the policies and procedures
for administering the program, an opportunity to gain first-hand experience in administering an attestation program.
It was believed that this experience would assist the National Office in developing regulations and in providing
policy guidance for regional offices once they were assigned responsibility for administering the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule decentralizes the processing of attestations for four ETA regional offices_Boston, Chicago, Dallas,
and Seattle_by revising &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(b) and by making the modifications required elsewhere, so that the entire body of the rule reflects this decentralization.
Information on the addresses of the four regional offices and the States served by each has been added to the instructions
for completing the Form ETA 9029.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(c)(1)(iii) of the interim final rule, a facility submitting an attestation prior to April 1, 1991, was allowed
to claim business exigency as a basis for delaying the compilation of documentation supporting its attestation for
up to 90 days after submission of its attestation. This provision, now obsolete, which was intended to ease the transition
from the H&hyph;1 to the H&hyph;1A program, has been deleted from the final rule since the applicable date has passed.

accordance with section 212(m)(2)(A)(i) of the INA, as the elimination or curtailment of essential health care services
not otherwise available ``at the facility.'' Section 212(m)(2)(A)(i) of the INA requires the facility to attest
that ``there would be a substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services
of the facility without the services of [the] alien''. The final rule makes this change, so that the third indicator
of substantial disruption, as described in

XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(d)(2)(C) of the final rule reads so that it applies to the elimination or curtailment of health services at the
facility.

4. Timely and Significant Steps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 212(m)(2)(E)(iv) of the INA provides that a violation will be found if a facility ``fail[s] to meet a condition
attested to''. The regulation, &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(g)(1), has been modified, in accordance with this statutory directive, to specify that employers will be held
responsible for all timely and significant steps to which they attest. If, for example, the employer attests it is
taking four timely and significant steps, but is found in an investigation to be complying with only two, a violation
will be cited. It should be noted that the INA requires a minimum of two steps, unless taking a second step would be unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule required a facility taking the third timely and significant step specified in section 212(m)(2)(B)(iii)
of the INA_the facility is paying nurses at a higher rate than nurses similarly employed in the_area to maintain documentation
showing that its entire schedule of wages for nurses is at least 5 percent higher than the prevailing wages, as determined
pursuant to 22 &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.310(e)(1). The question arose whether, in the case of a facility where wages for nurses are the result of arms-length
collective bargaining, this regulation required the facility to pay at least 5 percent higher than the collectively-bargained
rate in order to attest to the third statutory step. The Department has concluded that it is not reasonable to require
that facilities pay 5 percent higher than a collectively-bargained rate, if such a wage is at least five percent higher
than the prevailing wage for the geographic area as determined by the SESA. Therefore, in the final rule &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been amended to allow a facility the option of attesting to the third timely and significant step if its entire
schedule of collectively-bargained wage rates is 5 percent above the prevailing wage as determined by the SESA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, an employer organization, suggested a new waiver provision. This commenter proposed that any facility
which can demonstrate that it is unable to meet the requirements for nursing services under title XVIII or title XIX
of the Social Security Act, or that can demonstrate that it fails to meet minimum federal or state statutory requirements
for nursing staff, should be exempt from the fourth attestation element_timely and significant steps. The Department
has concluded that it does not have the authority to promulgate such a waiver, since timely and significant steps are
required by the statute.

5. Review of Attestations Accepted and Not Accepted for Filing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule's provision for administrative-judicial review of a determination by DOL whether or not to
accept an attestation for filing has been clarified. Under &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.301(e), an appeal may be taken to the Board of Alien Labor Certification Appeals only on an ETA determination where
ETA has performed a review function. The four instances in which ETA performs a review function involve determinations
on the following issues only: (1) The facility attests to a ``non-standard'' indicator of substantial disruption
(Element I); (2) the facility takes as one of its two steps a ``non-standard'' timely and significant step (Element
IV); (3) the facility attests that taking a second timely and significant step under Element IV would not be reasonable;
and (4) the facility is not an employer of H&hyph;1A nurses and is claiming a bona fide medical emergency as the basis
for requesting a waiver of one or more of the attestation elements.

6. Technical Amendments to Enforcement Subpart
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on ESA's operational experience with the H&hyph;1A program, three technical changes have been made in subpart
E on enforcement. First, to regularize the hearing process, while remaining consistent with Congressional intent
regarding timely hearings for interested parties, the final rule specifies that, once the deadline for requesting
a hearing has expired, an interested party may participate in an administrative law judge proceeding only with the
approval of the judge. Further, to make the hearing and notification process more easily understood, the final rule
has a separate section setting out the stages at which the enforcement determination becomes final agency action
and notification (if any) is sent to ETA and INS. In the interim final rule, these provisions appeared in the same section
with the provisions regarding the ESA determination notification, and this regulatory structure was somewhat confusing.
In addition, the final rule contains an express statement of the opportunity to direct inquiries and requests for
technical assistance to the Wage and Hour Division of ESA. The final rule also expressly authorizes the filing of hearing
requests by facsimile transmission (FAX) and requires that the Solicitor of Labor will be appropriately served with
hearing requests. Finally, the rule has been modified to make corrections regarding cross references and citations.

II. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in the final rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and have been assigned OMB Control No. 1205&hyph;0305.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on operating experience, technical changes were made to the Form ETA 9029 to clarify the attestation requirements
and reduce the need for separate explanatory statements. The Department believes that the changes to the form will
result in a decrease in the proportion of attestations returned to employers because they are unacceptable for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included among the changes made to the form are the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The phrase ``no explanatory statement required'' has been added as a parenthetical after the first two indicators
of substantial disruption under item 8.a.(ii), to make it clear that explanatory statements are no longer required
for these two attestation elements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The word ``past'' has been added before ``elimination/curtailment'' in the third indicator of substantial disruption
under item 8.a.(ii), to make it clear that the elimination or curtailment must already have occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Language has been added under item 8.b. clarifying that in order to be in compliance with the no adverse effect wage
requirement the facility must be paying each nurse it employs at least the prevailing wage as determined by the SESA
unless wages for nurses at the facility are the result of a collective bargaining agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The words ``developed under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act'' have been added to item 8.d.(i)
to clarify that the State plan has to be one developed pursuant to the requirements of the INA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The words ``steps of comparable timeliness and significance'' have been added to the sixth box under item 8.d.(ii)
to clarify the ``other'' timely and significant step category.

ETA estimates that 1,400 facilities per year will be submitting attestations. The public reporting burden for this
collection of information is estimated to average 8&hyph;10 hours for searching existing information/data sources
and gathering and compiling the data at the facility the first year that a facility submits an attestation. In the second,
and subsequent years, the reporting burden, based on operating experience, will average 2&hyph;3 hours.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes the H&hyph;1A program to provide relief for the nursing shortage
crisis. Subpart D of this part sets forth the procedure by which health care facilities seeking to use nonimmigrant
registered nurses may submit attestations to the Department of Labor relating to the effects of the nursing shortage
on their operations, their efforts to recruit and retain United States workers as registered nurses and certain information
on wages and working conditions for nurses at the facility. Subpart E of this part sets forth complaint, investigation,
and penalty provisions with respect to such attestations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The INA establishes a procedure for health care facilities to follow in seeking admission to the United States for,
or use of, nonimmigrant nurses under H&hyph;1A visas. The procedure is designed to reduce reliance on nonimmigrant
nurses in the future, and calls of the health care facility to attest, and be able to demonstrate, that, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there would be substantial disruption to health services without the nonimmigrant nurses and that it is taking timely
and significant steps to develop, recruit, and retain U.S. nurses. Subparts D and E of this part set forth the specific
requirements for those procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Subparts D and E of this part apply to all facilities that seek the temporary admission or use of nonimmigrants as
registered nurses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the period that the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) apply, subparts D and E of this part shall apply to the entry of a nonimmigrant who is a citizen of Mexico under
and pursuant to the provisions of section D of Annex 1603 of NAFTA.

Complaints.

 Complaints concerning misrepresentation in the attestation or failure of the health care facility to carry out the
terms of the attestation may be filed with the Wage and Hour Division (Division), Employment Standards Administration

may include assertions that a facility's attestations of compliance failed to meet the regulatory standards for
attestation elements under which the attestation was accepted by ETA for filing without ETA review. The Division
shall then investigate, and, where appropriate, after an opportunity for a hearing, assess sanctions and penalties.
Subpart E of this part also provides that interested parties may obtain an administrative law judge hearing and may
seek the Secretary's review of the administrative law judge's decision.

Facility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a user of nursing services with either a single site or a group of contiguous locations at which it provides health
care services. ``Facility'' includes an employer of registered nurses which provides health care services in a home
or other setting, such as a hospital, nursing home, or other site of employment, not owned or operated by the employer
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a visiting nurse association or a nursing contractor). ``Facility'' also includes a private household which employs
or seeks to employ one or more H&hyph;1A nurses, but does not include a private household which uses H&hyph;1A nurses
only through a nursing contractor. Groups of structures which form a campus or separate buildings across the street
from one another are a single facility. However, separate buildings or areas which are not physically connected or
in immediate proximity are a single health care facility if they are in reasonable geographic proximity, used for
the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. An example is an entity which manages a nursing home
and a hospital in the same area and which regularly shifts or rotates the nurses between the two. Non-contiguous sites,
even within the same geographic area, which do not share the same nursing staff and operational purposes are not a single
facility. For example, hospitals which are located on opposite sides of a municipality, but which are managed or owned
by a single entity, are separate facilities if they do not regularly share nursing staff and operational purpose.

to the attesting facility to include a sufficient number of facilities to permit a prevailing wage determination
to be made. If the place of the intended worksite is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), any place within
the MSA may be deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment.

constitute a layoff. The layoff provision applies to staff nurses only, not to other health occupations. If the position
occupied by the staff nurse is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement
definition of ``layoff'' (if any) shall apply to that position.

(3) Be fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which
authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to practice as a registered nurse immediately
upon admission to the United States, and be authorized under such laws to be employed by the employer. For purposes
of this paragraph, the temporary or interim licensing may be obtained immediately after the alien enters the United
States and registers to take the first available examination for permanent licensure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) It has a current nurse vacancy rate of 7 percent or more. An explanatory statement does not have to be submitted for
this attestation element, but documentation to support this attestation shall be maintained at the facility and

provide brief explanatory information about the essential services eliminated or curtailed by the facility due
to a nursing shortage, what documentation is available at the facility to substantiate this attestation, where this
documentation is located and can be reviewed, and the applicable time period of the documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) It has been unable to effect established plans to provide needed new health care services in the community due to
a shortage of nurses, and provide brief explanatory information about needed new services that have not been implemented
by the facility due to a nursing shortage and which will be implemented with the availability of H&hyph;1A nurses,

 When an attesting facility finds that the indicators in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section cannot
be demonstrated, or that such indicators are inappropriate to that facility, but that without the services of H&hyph;1A
nurses, substantial disruption in the delivery of health care services of the facility still would occur due to a shortage
or nurses, the facility shall provide an explanation of how a shortage of nurses has caused a ``substantial disruption''
in the delivery of its health care services. Such explanation shall be sufficient to provide a clear showing of ``substantial
disruption'' in the delivery of specific health care services due to a shortage of nurses, and shall clearly explain
why the indicators in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section cannot be met by or are inappropriate to
that facility. In addition to the documentation required to be maintained by attesting facilities described in paragraph
(d)(3) of this section, facilities attesting under this paragraph also shall maintain and make available for inspection
(as described elsewhere in this section) such additional documentation as is necessary to substantiate such claim
of substantial disruption.

 To meet the requirement of no adverse effect on wages, the facility shall attest that it shall pay each nurse of the facility
at least the prevailing wage for the occupation in the geographic area. The facility shall pay the higher of the wage
required pursuant to this paragraph (e) or the wage required pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State employment security determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facility does not independently determine the prevailing wage. The State employment security agency (SESA)
shall determine the prevailing wage for similarly employed nurses in the geographic area in accordance with administrative
guidelines or regulations issued by ETA. The facility shall request the appropriate prevailing wage from the SESA
not more than 90 days prior to the date the attestation is submitted to ETA. Once a facility obtains a prevailing wage
determination from the SESA and files an attestation supported by that prevailing wage determination, the facility
shall be deemed to have accepted the prevailing wage determination as accurate and appropriate (both to the occupational
classification and wage) and thereafter shall not contest the legitimacy of the prevailing wage determination in
an investigation or enforcement action. A facility may challenge a SESA prevailing wage determination through the
Employment Service complaint system. See 20 CFR part 658, Subpart E. A facility which challenges a SESA prevailing
wage determination shall obtain in final ruling from the Employment Service prior to filing an attestation. Any such
challenge shall not require the SESA to divulge any employer wage data which was collected under the promise of confidentiality.

The steps described in this paragraph (g)(1) shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps
that may be taken to meet the conditions of this paragraph (g)(1). Nothing in this subpart or subpart E of this part shall
require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.
The facility is not required to have taken any of these steps prior to December 18, 1989. A facility choosing to take
timely and significant steps other than those specifically described in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section
shall submit with its attestation a description of the steps it is proposing to take and an explanation of how the proposed
steps are of comparable timeliness and significance to those described in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

Step Two: ``Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become
registered nurses.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This may include programs leading directly to a degree in nursing, or career ladder/career path programs which could
ultimately lead to a degree in nursing. A facility choosing this step shall maintain as documentation a description
of the content and eligibility requirements for both types of programs and an explanation of how the requirements
of this paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are satisfied by each program. Any such degree program shall be, at a minimum, either through an accredited community
college (leading to an associate's degree), 4-year college (a bachelor's degree), or diploma school, and the course
of study shall be one accredited by a State Board of Nursing (or its equivalent). For career ladder or career path programs,
the facility shall maintain documentation that the programs are normally part of a course of study or training which
prepares a U.S. worker for enrolling in formal direct training leading to a degree in nursing, either through an accredited
community college, a 4-year college, or a diploma school. See &sect;

total costs of such programs. U.S. workers participating in such programs shall be working or have worked in health
care occupations or health care facilities. The number of U.S. workers for whom such training is provided shall be
equal to no less than half the average number of vacancies for nurses during the 12-month period prior to the submission
of the attestation.

Step Three: ``Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered nurses similarly
employed in the geographic area.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A facility choosing this step shall maintain documentation showing that its entire schedule of wages for nurses is
at least 5 percent higher than the prevailing wages as determined by the SESA pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this
section, and it shall attest that such differentials shall be maintained throughout the period of the attestation's
effectiveness.

Step Four: ``Providing adequate support services to free registered nurses from administrative and other non-nursing
duties.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-nursing duties include such activities as housekeeping duties; food preparation and delivery; transporting
patients; providing occupational and respiratory therapy; answering telephones; running errands for patients;
and clerical tasks. A facility choosing this step shall not require nurses at the facility to perform non-nursing
duties. However, it is understood that on an infrequent non-recurring basis, nurses at the facility may perform one
or more of the tasks encompassed by the duties listed above in this paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or other non-nursing duties. Facilities choosing this step shall maintain documentation showing what steps they
have taken to ensure that nursing jobs do not include any of these duties and that such activity by nurses at the facility
occurs without regularity and infrequently. Such a facility also shall maintain documentation with respect to any
other steps being taken to relieve nurses from non-nursing duties, or to enhance the nursing function, such as computerizing
certain writing and routine functions performed by nurses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step Five: ``Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by registered nurses.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Documentation for this step shall include documentation of systems for salary advancement based on factors such
as merit, education, and specialty, and/or salary advancement based on length of service with other bases for wage
differentials remaining constant.

nurses which lead to salary advancement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.

attestation what these steps are, their nature and scope, how they are effected and how they meet the statutory test
of timeliness and significance comparable to those Steps One through Five described above. A facility choosing alternative
steps shall attest that its program(s) meet(s) the statutory requirements of timeliness and significance in promoting
the development, recruitment and retention of U.S. nurses, explaining how these requirements are satisfied by such
program(s). In addition, the attesting facility shall maintain and make available for inspection (as described

Such monetary incentives can be based on actions by nurses such as: Innovations to achieve better patient care, increased
productivity, reduced waste, better safety; obtaining additional certification in a nursing specialty; unused
sick leave; recruiting other U.S. nurses; staying with the facility for a given number of years; taking less desirable
assignments (other than shift differential); participating in professional organizations, on task forces and
on special committees; or contributing to professional publications. Facilities attesting to this step shall have

 The steps described in this paragraph (g)(1) shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps
that may be taken to meet the conditions of this paragraph (g)(1). Nothing in this subpart or subpart E of this part shall
require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.
However, a facility shall make every effort to take at least two steps. A facility taking only one step shall provide
an explanation with its attestation, and maintain documentation at the facility, relating to why taking a second
step is not reasonable. The taking of a second step may be considered unreasonable if it would result in the facility's
financial inability to continue providing the same quality and quantity of health care or if the provision of nursing
services would otherwise be jeopardized by the taking of such a step. If the single step which is taken is one of the statutorily
defined steps described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)(A)(

Alternative to criteria for each specific step.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Instead of complying with the specific criteria for each of the steps in the second and succeeding years, a facility
may include in its prior year's attestation, in addition to the actions taken under Steps One through Five, that it
shall reduce the number of alien (H&hyph;1 and H&hyph;1A visaholders) nurses it utilizes within 1 year from the date
of attestation by at least 10 percent, without reducing the quality or quantity of services provided. If this goal
is achieved (as demonstrated by documentation maintained by the facility and made available for inspection, and
indicated in its subsequent year's attestation), the facility's subsequent year's attestation may simply include
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form ETA 9029,

 an explanation demonstrating that this goal has been achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an attestation that it shall again reduce the number of alien nurses it utilizes within 1 year from the date of attestation
by at least 10 percent. This alternative is designed to permit a facility to achieve the objectives of the Act, without
subjecting the facility to detailed requirements and criteria as to the specific means of achieving that objective.
The first, second, and succeeding years shall be consecutive.

 The facility shall attest that ``there is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment
of such an alien is not intended or designated to influence an election for a bargaining representative for registered
nurses of the facility.'' Labor disputes for purposes for this attestation element relate only to those involving
nurses providing nursing services; other health service occupations are not included. This attestation element
applies to strikes and lockouts and elections of bargaining representatives at both the facility employing the nurse
and, in the case of nursing contractors, at the worksite facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A nursing contractor submitting an attestation for filing as a facility shall attest, in addition to the first through
sixth attestation elements, that it will refer H&hyph;1A nurses only to facilities that (with the exception of private
households which themselves do not employ H&hyph;1A nurses) have valid attestations on file with ETA. The nursing
contractor shall obtain from each such worksite facility a copy of that facility's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form ETA 9029, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
accepted for filing by ETA and then currently on file with ETA. The nursing contractor shall maintain a copy of such
worksite facility's accepted attestation on file at the nursing contractor's principal office during the validity
period of the nursing contractor's attestation or the period of time that any H&hyph;1A nurse in its employ is providing
nursing services at the worksite facility, whichever is longer.

Special provisions for worksite facilities which are not employers of H&hyph;1A nurses and are not controlled by
employers of H&hyph;1A nurses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A facility (other than a private household) which obtains the services of an H&hyph;1A nurse by contracting with a
nursing contractor, but which is itself neither the employer of any H&hyph;1A nurse nor controlled by the employer
of any H&hyph;1A nurse (see paragraph (k)(1) of this section), shall file an attestation with ETA pursuant to this
subpart. Such a worksite facility may request from ETA a waiver of specific elements of the attestation to avoid duplicative
attestations, in cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge
of the attestor, or for other good cause. The attesting worksite facility shall be to ably demonstrate the existence
of the circumstances or good cause which are asserted as the basis(es) for the request for a waiver of a particular element
of the attestation, but need not submit such evidence with its request for waiver, except evidence with respect to
a bona fide medical emergency (see paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section).

Worksites employing, seeking to employ, or filing visa petitions on behalf of H&hyph;1A nurses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An attestation with respect to which waiver is requested or granted pursuant to this paragraph (k) is not valid (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not ``on file and in effect'') for a worksite facility employing, seeking to employ, or filing a visa petition on
behalf of H&hyph;1A nurses. Only an attestation meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section
(and paragraph (j) of this section, in the case of a nursing contractor) can serve as the basis for a petition for an H&hyph;1A
visa. A worksite facility which uses H&hyph;1A nurses only through a nursing contractor and, as part of its attestation,
requests waiver of one or more attestation elements nevertheless shall file a complete attestation in order to be
able to use such attestation as a basis for itself filing a visa petition for an H&hyph;1A nurse. Thus, a worksite facility
should consider its future needs for H&hyph;1A nurses in filing attestations and requests for waiver pursuant to
this paragraph (k).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inapplicability of third attestation element: facility/employer wage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a worksite facility uses H&hyph;1A nurses only through a nursing contractor, the third attestation element (facility/employer
wage; see paragraph (f) of this section) is not applicable to that facility, since the worksite facility is not the
employer of the H&hyph;1A nurse and does not guarantee the H&hyph;1A nurse's wage. The third attestation element
is required only for the employer of the H&hyph;1A nurse(s), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the third attestation element shall be included in the attestation of and met by the H&hyph;1A nurse's employer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 the nursing contractor).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver of attestation elements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ETA may consider, pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) requests for waiver of certain attestation elements by a worksite
facility which uses or will use an H&hyph;1A nurse provided by a nursing contractor (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an ``H&hyph;1A contract nurse''), but which worksite facility itself does not employ, seek to employ, or file a visa
petition on behalf of an H&hyph;1A nurse. Paragraphs (k)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section set forth different
conditions for waiver depending on the number of workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services the worksite facility
will use. For the purposes of this paragraph (k)(3), a ``workday'' shall consist of one H&hyph;1A contract nurse working
for one normal shift in a day. Thus, for example, three normal shifts worked by each of a group of five H&hyph;1A contract
nurses totals 15 workdays.

Minimal use of H&hyph;1A contract nurses by a worksite.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it
will use no more than a total of 15 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's
1-year period of validity to meet emergency needs on a temporary basis, ETA may waive the first (substantial disruption),
second (adverse effect), and fourth (timely and significant steps or State plan) elements of the attesting worksite
facility's attestation. See paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section; see also paragraphs (f) and (k)(2) of this
section, with respect to the inapplicability of third attestation element (facility/employer wage). ETA shall
not waive pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(i) the fifth attestation element (strike, lockout, or intent or design
to influence bargaining representative election) or the sixth attestation element (notice). See paragraphs (h)
and (i) of this section.

 Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it
will use no more than a total of 60 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's
1-year period of validity to meet temporary needs, ETA may waive the nursing shortage component of the first element
(substantial disruption; see paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section) and may waive the fourth (timely and significant
steps or State plan; see paragraph (g) of this section) element of the attesting worksite facility's attestation.
See also paragraphs (f) and (k)(2) of this section, with respect to the inapplicability of third attestation element
(facility/employer wage). ETA shall not waive pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) the no-layoff component of
the first attestation element (substantial disruption; see paragraph (d)(1) of this section); the second attestation
element (adverse effect); the fifth attestation element (strike, lockout, or intent to influence a bargaining representative
election); or the sixth attestation element (notice). See paragraphs (d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section.

 Where the attesting worksite facility attests in its request for waiver pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3) that it
will use more than 60 workdays of H&hyph;1A contract nurse services in any 3-month period of the attestation's 1-year
period of validity, ETA shall not waive any attestation element, except that, if the attestor documents a bona fide
medical emergency warranting a waiver of the fourth attestation element (timely and significant steps or State plan)
ETA may waive such element. See paragraph (g) of this section.

 A worksite facility (including a worksite facility which itself employs or seeks to employ an H&hyph;1A nurse) may
authorize a nursing contractor to act as its agent in preparing and filing the worksite facility's attestation; however,
a worksite facility using an agent for preparation and filing of the attestation is responsible for the contents of
such attestation and remains liable for any violations which may be disclosed in any investigation under Subpart
E of this Part, and the chief executive officer of the worksite facility shall sign the original attestation, as required
by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

.310 shall be accepted for filing by ETA on the date it is signed by the Certifying Officer. ETA shall then follow the
procedures set forth in paragraph (m)(1) of this section. An attestation submitted by a facility proposing alternative
criteria or steps for the first and/or the fourth attestation elements, and/or proposing to take only one timely and
significant step, and/or claiming a bona fide medical emergency exemption from the fourth attestation element shall
be reviewed by ETA, and a determination shall be made by the Certifying Officer whether to accept or reject the attestation
for filing. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), and (k)(3)(iii) of this section. The Certifying
Officer may request additional explanation and/or documentation from the facility in making this determination.
If the Certifying Officer does not contact the facility for such information or make any determination within 30 days
of receiving the attestation, the attestation shall become accepted for filing. Upon the facility's submitting
the attestation to ETA and providing the notice required by the sixth attestation element (see &sect;

.310(i)), the attestation shall be available for public examination at the health care facility itself. When ETA
accepts the attestation for filing, the Certifying Officer shall forward the attestation to the ETA National Office,
where it shall be available for public examination. Information contesting an attestation received by ETA prior
to the determination to accept or reject the attestation for filing shall not be made part of ETA's administrative
record on the attestation, but shall be referred to ESA to be processed as a complaint pursuant to Subpart E of this part,
and, if such attestation nevertheless is accepted by ETA for filing, the complaint will be handled by ESA under that
subpart.

 Suspension or invalidation of an attestation may result from a BALCA decision reversing an ETA acceptance for filing;
from investigations by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, of the facility's misrepresentation in or failure
to carry out its attestation; or from a discovery by ETA that it made an error in its review of the attestation (in those
cases where ETA performs such review pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), (k)(3)(iii)

 If an attestation is suspended or invalidated as a result of a BALCA decision overruling an acceptance of the attestation
for filing, or is suspended or invalidated as a result of a Wage and Hour Division action pursuant to subpart E, such
suspension or invalidation may not be separately appealed, but shall be merged with appeals of BALCA's or the Wage

If a State determines to file an annual State plan, the Governor shall submit the original plan, signed by the Governor,
by U.S. mail or private carrier, to ETA at the following address: Director, U.S. Employment Service, Employment and
Training Administration, Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;4456, Washington, DC
20210. An annual State plan may be filed with ETA at any time. However, for an individual facility legitimately to attest

for filing and be in current effect. Therefore, if the Governor is aware that a facility within the State plans to submit
an attestation for filing with ETA, the annual State plan should be mailed to ETA at least 35 days prior to the facility's
submission of its attestation to ETA.

The annual State plan shall address the overall issue of supply of and demand for nurses within the State, with particular
emphasis on measures to develop a sufficient supply of U.S. nurses to meet projected demand. The State, as opposed
to individual facilities, is in a position to_and may be expected to_address broad issues and perform such functions
as conducting a Statewide needs assessment; overall management, facilitation and coordination among various interested
entities within the State; and undertaking more regionally based approaches. The State is also in a position to devote
resources which individual facilities may be lacking.

complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be reduced to writing by the Wage and Hour Division official who receives
the complaint. The complaint shall set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine what part or parts
of the attestation or regulations have allegedly been violated. Upon the request of the complainant, the Administrator
shall, to the extent possible under existing law, maintain confidentiality regarding the complainant's identity;
if the complainant wishes to be a party to the administrative hearing proceedings under this subpart, the complainant

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains a final rule amending the regulations on trade adjustment assistance for workers which implement
the 1988 Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 as contained in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. This
action will update the regulations and will provide uniform instructions to State agencies in carrying-out their
responsibilities under the Trade Act. These State agencies act as agents of the United States for the purpose of providing
adjustment assistance benefits and services to adversely affected workers. Comments are requested on the several
material changes being made in this final rule, which differ from the September 1988 proposed rule, and on a number
of other changes which were not included in the proposed rule.

In General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Trade Act of 1974 made major changes to the trade adjustment assistance program (hereafter ``TAA program'') for
workers displaced because of increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced
by the workers' firm. On receiving a petition for trade adjustment assistance (hereafter ``TAA'') from a group of
workers or its authorized representative, the Department conducts a factfinding investigation in response to the
petition. If the findings substantiate that the workers of a firm or subdivision of a firm have been adversely affected
by import competition, a certification is issued stating that the workers are eligible to apply at a local office of
a State employment security agency for TAA benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1981 Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 (Title XXV of Pub. L. 97&hyph;35) made extensive changes in the TAA program.
Further changes were made in the 1984 Amendments (Sections 2671 and 2672, of Pub. L. 98&hyph;369) and in the 1986 Amendments
(Part 1 of Subtitle A of Title XIII of Pub. L. 99&hyph;272). Final regulations implementing the 1986 Amendments were
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 24, 1988, at 53 FR 32344, and on May 23, 1989, at 54 FR 22277. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1988 Amendments to the TAA program are contained in Part 3, Trade Adjustment Assistance, of subtitle D of title
I of the ``Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988'' (Pub. L. 100&hyph;418) (hereafter the ``OTCA''). The 1988
Amendments expand eligibility for TAA to workers in the oil and natural gas industry engaged in exploration and drilling;
require detailed information about TAA program benefits to be given to every individual who files an initial claim
for unemployment benefits, and further require an individualized notice to every worker believed to be covered by
a certification issued by the Department; require publication of a notice of the certification in a newspaper of general
circulation; require a worker to participate in training as a condition for receiving basic trade readjustment allowances
(hereafter ``TRA''); authorize the waiver of the training requirement for a worker when training is not feasible
or appropriate; authorize the payment of basic and additional TRA to a worker during breaks in training that do not
exceed 14 days; reinstate the movable eligibility period for basic TRA, based on the worker's most recent qualifying
(total) separation rather than the first qualifying separation as was previously required; extend the expiration
date of the TAA program to September 30, 1993; emphasize coordination with programs and services to dislocated workers
provided under title III of the Job Training Partnership Act; and make other changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While most of the provisions of Part 3 affecting the TAA program are in the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II
of the Trade Act of 1974, some provisions of Part 3 affecting workers do not amend existing law. Examples are the provision
which permits workers in the oil and natural gas industry engaged in exploration or drilling, separated after September
30, 1985, to file petitions under new eligibility rules, and the provision concerning the eligibility of workers
totally separated from adversely affected employment during the period beginning August 13, 1981, and ending April
7, 1986. The provisions of the 1988 Amendments became effective, in general, on August 23, 1988, except that the amendments
to sections 231(a)(5), (b) and (c) took effect on November 21, 1988, and the amendment to Section 225 took effect on
September 22, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many of the 1988 Amendments were effective on the date of their enactment into law, August 23, 1988, most notably
the new ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA, the Department issued interim Operating Instructions in General
Administration Letter (hereafter ``GAL'') No. 7&hyph;88, dated September 12, 1988, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 16, 1988, at 53 FR 36180&hyph;36213, together with Training and Employment Information Notice (hereafter
``TEIN'') 6&hyph;88. GAL 7&hyph;88 and the two changes thereto were subsequently rescinded and replaced by GAL 15&hyph;90,
dated August 21, 1990. These GALs disseminated controlling guidance to the States on the administration of the TAA
program as amended by the OTCA, pending the issuance of final amendments to the regulations. GAL 15&hyph;90 was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 21, 1990, at 55 FR 48774&hyph;48800, together with TEIN 13&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the issuance of GAL 7&hyph;88, amendments to the regulations at 20 CFR part 617, implementing the 1988 Amendments,
were proposed in a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 30, 1988, at 53 FR 48474, with a comment period ending on December 30, 1988. Preparation of a final rule document,
addressing the comments received, began after the end of the comment period. The need for other changes in the regulations
was identified in light of the comments received, further reflection on the 1988 Amendments, and experience with
the interim Operating Instructions. The most significant changes, resulting in the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 and
in delaying the publication of this final rule document, were the changes in the interpretations of subsections (a)
and (g) of Section 1430 of the OTCA, relating to the new ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA. This significant
change, and other related changes, were announced in GAL 15&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule therefore includes substantive changes in the amendments to part 617 that were included in the proposed
rule published on November 30, 1988. The most significant of these changes are the new interpretations of the effective
dates of the 1988 Amendments relating to the ``movable'' eligibility period for basic trade readjustment allowances
(&sect;&sect;617.3 and 617.11(a) (1) and (2)). This document also includes substantive changes to Part 617 that
were not included in the published proposed rule, including sub-stantive changes that were announced in Changes
2 and 3 to GAL 15&hyph;90, relating to a complete revision of &sect;617.26 and a change in &sect;617.22(a). Many of
these substantive changes resulted from a consideration of comments received on the proposed rule. Nonetheless,
in the interests of keeping its rulemaking processes as open as possible, the Department is inviting public comments
on these changes. Further changes are made in &sect;&sect;617.3, 617.11(a), 617.15(b) and (d), 617.16, 617.19(b),
617.21, 617.22(f), 617.33, 617.44, 617.50(d), 617.55, 617.60 and 617.64, which are related to the revision of &sect;617.26
or for other reasons as explained below. Conforming changes are also made in &sect;617.67.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effective date of all of the substantive changes in the statute and the regulations that are announced in any GAL
(or change thereto) is the same as the effective date of the amendment(s) to which the GAL pertains, but any substantive
change in GAL operating instructions applies, unless stated otherwise, in the case of all decisions made after the
date of issuance of the GAL (or change thereto) by the Department. However, all of the substantive changes noted below
in items A through R are subject to an opportunity for comment after publication of this final rule. After the end of
the comment period, and consideration of any comments received, another final rule document will be published relating
to these substantive changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantive changes in the interpretations of the 1988 Amendments which are addressed below relate primarily to
the effective date and application of the new eligibility period for basic TRA, but also relate to other provisions
of the OTCA, the Trade Act of 1974 and section 106(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;318 which amends section 231(a)(2) of the
Trade Act, as discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's new interpretations center on the effective date provisions of subsections (a) and (g) of Section
1430 of the OTCA. These new interpretations are discussed in detail in paragraph A, below.

Good Cause Exception
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B), that good cause exists for publication in final of
the substantive changes in this document, because all of such changes are essential to the proper administration
of the TAA program by the States, and such changes either relieve a restriction, and have been previously announced
in controlling operating instructions issued to the States, or relate primarily to procedural relationships between
and among the States. In addition, because of the delays encountered in issuing this final rule, any further delay
in putting these substantive changes into effect would be impractical and contrary to the public interest. As explained
above, comments are invited and will be considered, after which a final rule will be published. In the meantime, public
implementation of these substantive changes as final regulations will not be delayed further.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the following text, therefore, substantive changes, on which comments are requested, are addressed first. These
changes are followed by a discussion of the comments received on the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substantive changes noted under this heading are either changes in the amendments to part 617, as published on
November 30, 1988, or changes in other sections of Part 617 that were not included in the proposed rule. These substantive
changes also include conforming changes in the transition provisions of &sect;617.67.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are requested on all of these substantive changes, after which a final rule document on such changes will
be published.

A. New Eligibility Period for Basic TRA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1425 (a) of the OTCA amended section 233(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 to reinstate the ``movable'' eligibility
period for basic TRA. Section 1430(a) of the OTCA made this amendment effective on the date of enactment, August 23,
1988, and section 1430(g) of the OTCA provided that amended section 233(a)(2) would not be applied in certain circumstances
if it would result in an earlier expiration date of a worker's eligibility period established on the basis of the prior
law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988 (53 FR 48474) (as well as in Section 4.F.1. of GAL 7&hyph;88), Section
1430(a) was interpreted as making this amendment applicable to any total qualifying separation which occurred on
or after August 23, 1988. The limitation in section 1430 (g) was interpreted as applying with respect to any such total
qualifying separation if it would result in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period of a worker based
on the prior law and a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In GAL 15&hyph;90, issued on August 21, 1990, the Department announced that, in conjunction with the development
of final regulations implementing the 1988 Amendments, the Department determined that the previously published
interpretations of the effective date provisions in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988, were in error.
The same erroneous interpretations were contained in GAL 7&hyph;88, and this fact necessitated the issuance of revised
operating instructions in GAL 15&hyph;90, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 21, 1990, at 55 FR 48774.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (a) of section 1430 of the OTCA provides that: ``Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amendments
made by this part shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.'' Subsection (a) thus applied to, among others,
the amendment to section 233(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, which prescribes the eligibility period for basic TRA.
In the proposed rule and in GAL 7&hyph;88, the amendment to section 233(a)(2) was interpreted as being applicable
to separations which occurred on or after the date of enactment of the OTCA, August 23, 1988.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the new interpretations announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, section 1430(a) was interpreted as applying to all decisions
(i.e., all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) made on and after August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concluded, and announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, that amended section 233(a)(2) should be applied to all
decisions rendered on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of whether they involved initial determinations of TRA
eligibility, redeterminations, or decisions on appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also stated in GAL 15&hyph;90 that the new interpretation of section 1430(a) is supported by the analysis
and construction placed on subsection (g) of section 1430, and by the general principle of law known as the law-in-effect
rule. Under the law-in-effect rule, the law to be applied in making any decision is the law in effect at the time the decision
is made. In GAL 15&hyph;90, this law-in-effect rule was determined to be applicable to the new interpretations and
the 1988 Amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (g) of section 1430 provides that the amendment to section 233(a)(2) ``shall not apply with respect to
any total separation of a worker *&blank;*&blank;* that occurs before the date of enactment of this Act if the application
of such amendment with respect to such total separation would reduce the period for which such worker would (but for
such amendment) be allowed to receive'' basic TRA. In the proposed rule and in GAL 7&hyph;88, section 1430(g) was interpreted
as limiting the application of amended section 233(a)(2) to total separations which occurred on or after August 23,
1988, where the result otherwise achieved would be an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period of a worker
established on the basis of the prior law and a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the new interpretations announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, section 1430(g) was interpreted literally as applying only
to total separations that occurred before August 23, 1988, and the limitation in section 1430(g) thus applies only
to such prior separations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consequence of this new interpretation of section 1430(g) is that, if the application of amended section 233(a)(2)
to a total separation prior to August 23, 1988, would result in extending the worker's eligibility period, the amended
section 233(a)(2) shall be applied. Conversely, amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied to total separations
which occur on and after August 23, 1988, regardless of whether it would result in an earlier expiration date of the
worker's eligibility period based upon a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1430(g) is not applicable, however, to a ``first qualifying separation'' which occurs before August 23,
1988. It is on the basis of such a first qualifying separation that a worker would have a longer eligibility period ``but
for'' the amendment to section 233(a)(2). To preserve a longer eligibility period, and thereby give effect to the
limitation in section 1430(g), therefore, such limitation could not logically be made applicable to such a first
qualifying separation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more extensive explanation and justification for the new interpretations affecting amended section 233(a)(2)
was set forth in GAL 15&hyph;90, and in Attachment A and Section F.1. of GAL 15&hyph;90. That explanation and justification
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at 55 FR 48774, 48778, 48782, and 48789 (November 21, 1990).

The new interpretations require substantive changes in the final rule, particularly in the definitions of ``eligibility
period'' and the various types of ``separation'' defined in &sect;&sect;617.3(m) and 617.3(t), as well as in the
transition provisions in &sect;617.67. Other conforming changes are made throughout the document, including the
deletion of clause (D) in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(iii).

The Department also has decided that the 1988 Amendments relating to sections 231(a)(5), 231(b), and 231(c) of the
Trade Act, which, under section 1430(f) of the OTCA, took effect 90 days after the date of enactment (i.e., on November
21, 1988), are not affected by the new interpretation of section 1430(a). Although the effective date language of
section 1430(f) is the same as the effective date language of section 1430(a), the Department has determined that
the application of the new interpretation to these provisions would cause manifest injustice to affected workers
and also would appear to be contrary to the intent of the Congress and the logic of the 90-day delay in the effective date
of these amendments. This is more fully explained in GAL 15&hyph;90 and Attachment A.

Section 106(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;318 amended section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 by adding a new paragraph
(D) to the categories which are considered a week of adversely affected employment at wages of $30 or more a week in order
to qualify for TRA. The new subparagraph (D) provides that any week a worker is on call-up for active duty in a reserve
status in the armed forces, provided such active duty is ``Federal service'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8521(a)(1), shall
constitute a week in meeting the TRA qualifying requirements of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974. Section
106(a) also clarifies that not more than 26 weeks described in subparagraphs (B) or (D) of section 231(a)(2) of the
Trade Act may be used for TRA qualifying purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This means that all of the required employment and wages necessary to qualify for TRA may be attained during a reservist's
call-up to active duty. This amendment only affects the TRA qualifying requirement in section 231(a)(2); all other
TRA qualifying requirements in section 231 are unchanged. Therefore, State agencies must also determine if a reservist
meets the remaining TRA qualifying requirements contained in section 231 of the Trade Act before awarding TRA entitlement
to the reservist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the worker's qualifying weeks at wages of $30 or more a week for TRA qualifying purposes, the amendment
to section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act applies to weeks beginning after August 1, 1990. The effective date of this amendment
results in a retroactive application to TRA claims filed (or which would have been filed) by reservists who took part
in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. This means that State agencies must redetermine the TRA initial claims
of all reservists called-up for active duty whose claims were denied solely because they did not meet the requirements
of section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act as in effect prior to the enactment of this amendment. State agencies must also
take TRA initial claims of reservists who did not previously file a TRA initial claim because they did not meet the requirements
of section 231(a)(2) as in effect prior to the enactment of this amendment.

Section 1425(b) of OTCA provides eligibility for TRA to certain workers who were continuously unemployed since separation
from adversely affected employment during the period from August 13, 1981 to April 7, 1986, not taking into account
seasonal employment, odd jobs, or part-time, temporary employment. This provision opened up eligibility to workers
who could not qualify for additional weeks of TRA because they did not meet the 210-day time limit for filing for training
and to workers who did not receive all of their TRA entitlement because their eligibility period was based on their
first rather than their most recent separation. In the proposed rule, general guidance was provided to State agencies
on ``continuously unemployed'' but State agencies were allowed to apply the provisions using their expertise in
determining eligibility relating to employment. However, the Department decided that it was essential to provide
State agencies with guiding instructions for implementing section 1425(b)(2)(A) (ii) of the OTCA so that the Department,
rather than States, defines the limits of the Federal liability. Accordingly, definitions to be used in applying
the terms ``seasonal employment'', ``odd jobs'' and ``part-time, temporary employment'' are added in a new clause
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(E). Because precise definitions were not available for each of these terms, definitions
were developed for purposes of this final rule from various sources and other program applications. The seasonal
provision of applicable State law is used in applying the ``seasonal employment'' provision. A definition for ``odd
jobs'' was developed in which the established period of employment occurs within 5 days or less. The definition for
``part-time'' is taken from the ETA Glossary of Program Terms and Definitions (ETA Handbook No. 373), which provides
for less than 30 hours per week of regularly scheduled work. However, that definition has to be applied along with ``temporary
employment.'' The definition for ``temporary employment'' is based on ETA reporting requirements for the public
employment service in which an established employment period of 150 days or less is used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to &sect;617.15 were included in the proposed rule published for comment on November 30, 1988. A further
change in &sect;617.15 was considered as a result of the reinstatement of the movable eligibility period for basic
TRA. This change was to base the 210-day period for filing an application for training, in order to qualify for up to
26 weeks of additional TRA, on the worker's most recent partial or total separation from employment under the certification,
rather than within 210 days after the date of the first qualifying separation. This change reinstates the rule that
was applicable prior to the 1981 Amendments, when the eligibility period was movable, and was adopted with the issuance
of Change 2 to GAL 7&hyph;88, dated May 22, 1989. In view of the new interpretation of section 1430(a), and the law-in-effect
rule, a further change was made in the interpretation and application of the 210-day rule, which was announced in GAL
15&hyph;90. The new interpretation applies to all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions
on appeals) which are made after the date of issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90, on August 21, 1990. (See GAL 15&hyph;90 and
section E.4 of Attachment A). These changes are incorporated in &sect;617.15(b) of this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule was published for comment on November 30, 1988. At that time, the Department had concluded that days
``in which training would not normally be scheduled'' should not be counted as part of a scheduled break in training.
Initially, the Department limited the exclusion to Saturdays and Sundays, if training in the applicable training
program would not normally be conducted on those days. In GAL 7&hyph;88, and Change 1 to GAL 7&hyph;88, the Department
interpreted section 233(f) of the Trade Act as excluding certain weekend days and holidays in counting the days of
a break in training. GAL 7&hyph;88 and Change 1 were unclear, however, whether the exclusion of holidays included
both National and State holidays. On further consideration, the Department agreed that all officially recognized
National and State holidays should be excluded in counting the days of a break in training, to the extent that training
in the applicable training program would not normally be scheduled on those days if they did not occur during the break.
This change was adopted with the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 and is applicable to all decisions (i.e., all determinations,
redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) which are made on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of when the training
was approved under section 236 of the Trade Act, or whether the training was approved or is approvable under section
236 as amended by the 1988 Amendments, or when the break in training began or ended. In making decisions under &sect;617.15(d),
the law to be applied is the law as in effect on the date the decision is made, and this rule has applied since the issuance
of GAL 15&hyph;90 on August 21, 1990. Decisions previously made under prior operating instructions are subject to
redetermination in accordance with State law, as set forth in section 4.b. of GAL 15&hyph;90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify what constitutes a ``break in training'' for purposes of section 233(f), a new clause (2) is added
to &sect;617.15(d) defining a break in training as including all periods within or between courses, terms, quarters,
semesters and academic years, whether or not such breaks are scheduled by the training provider.

G. Revision of &sect;617.16
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 234 of the Trade Act of 1974 specifies the State law provisions that shall be applicable to claimants for TRA
purposes, and &sect;617.16 distills the provisions of section 234 in a definition of ``applicable State law.'' Section
617.16 is now being revised for two essential reasons. The first reason is to include in the definition the situation
of the worker who is not entitled to UI after separation from adversely affected employment, as is provided for in Section
234. This had not seemed relevant after the 1981 Amendments, because of the addition in section 231(a)(3) of the eligibility
requirement that the worker must be entitled to and have exhausted all UI. The 1988 Amendments, however, have prompted
rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the States in the administration of the TAA program, and particularly
of the role of the ``applicable State'' (i.e., the State whose law is the applicable State law) in the case of TAA program
benefits other than TRA. Accordingly, the definition of ``applicable State law'' is broadened so that it is a useful
reference point for all TAA program benefits. While providing a useful reference point, there is no intent in revising

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.16 to suggest that an individual who is not entitled to UI after a qualifying separation from adversely
affected employment may be entitled to TRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second reason for revising &sect;617.16 is to conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.16 to the revision of &sect;617.26, relating to the roles and responsibilities of the States as liable
States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. As discussed below, &sect;617.26 is revised to incorporate
the Department's thinking as set out in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90. In this connection, consideration was given to
including in &sect;617.16 the definition of ``applicable State'' which is set forth in Change 2. Upon further consideration,
however, it was decided that the definition of ``applicable State law'' furnished the most useful reference point
for all purposes of the TAA program, and that a special definition of ``applicable State'' is neither necessary nor
useful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;617.16 is revised to track more closely Section 234, and to serve as a useful reference point for
all of the purposes of the TAA program. The section also is modified to make it clear that the UI entitlement referred
to is that which immediately follows a qualifying separation from adversely affected employment, and not UI entitlement
in some past period, however recent or remote it may have been. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Revision of &sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clause (A) of &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii) explains that training is not appropriate when the firm from which the individual
was separated plans to recall the individual within the ``reasonably foreseeable future''. Also, &sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B)
defines ``appropriate'' as including whether there is a reasonable prospect which is reasonably foreseeable that
the individual will be reemployed by the separating firm. These provisions are consistent with &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii)
on conditions for approval of training when there is reasonable prospect of suitable work within the foreseeable
future. (See item 43 below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is reasonable to deny training under &sect;617.22 (a) to a worker who is scheduled for recall, there is an identified
need to provide additional guidance in the regulations on the application of the term ``recall that will occur in the
reasonably foreseeable future'', for purposes of administering &sect;&sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are consistent with the Administration's position to tighten waivers. Publication of these regulations
will improve efficiency in utilizing waivers. This moves the current TAA program in to closer alignment with the Transitional
Adjustment Assistance provisions of NAFTA. Therefore, this section is being amended by adding a new clause (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to &sect;&sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(A), for use in approving training and granting waivers. Clause (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) provides guidance on two types of planned recalls. The first type is a specific recall where an individual or group
of individuals who was separated from employment is identified and notified by the employer to return to work within
a specified time period. In this situation an individual would not be approved for training and a waiver of the training
requirement would be granted for purposes of receiving basic TRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type is a general recall where the employer announces an intention to recall an individual or group of individuals,
or by other action reasonably signals an intent to recall, but does not specify a certain time period in which the recall
will occur. In this situation, if the recall in each individual case is reasonably expected to occur after the individual
would exhaust his or her eligibility for regular UI associated with the most recent total separation that is within
the TAA certification period, the individual would be treated as any other individual who was separated from adversely
affected employment and the participation in training requirement would be applied.

I. Revision of &sect;617.21
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.21 describes the activities that are included as reemployment services and allowances. Paragraph (e)
of this section is revised to add child care as a support service. This revision is made to eliminate any uncertainty
that child care is a support service and that the costs for such service may not be charged as a related cost of training
and paid with TAA program funds. See also the Department's response to item 47 below.

Paragraph (g) of this section is also revised to reflect the 1988 Amendment to section 236 of the Act which added remedial
education as being approvable as classroom training. Training designed to enhance the employability of individuals
by upgrading basic skills, through remedial education or English-as-second-language courses, are considered
as remedial education approvable under &sect;617.22(a) if all the approval criteria in that section are met. A training
program of remedial education only may now be approved for an individual if he or she possesses occupational skills
and needs only remedial education to obtain employment. Ordinarily, remedial education is made part of a broader
skills training program as defined in &sect;617.22(f) (3).

J. Revision of &sect;617.22(a)(5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.22(a) lists six criteria that must be met for approval of training. These are intended to assure that training
will lead to a specific occupational goal. Clause (5) of &sect;617.22(a) deals with a worker's personal qualifications
to undertake and complete such training. The Department's interpretation of this clause has been changed to add ``financial
resources'' to those personal qualifications, and this change is included in amended &sect;617.22(a)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Change 3 to GAL 15&hyph;90, dated July 17, 1991, (56 FR 46331, 46333), announced a change in the definition of the criterion
for approval of training in Section 236(a)(1) (E) of the Act, by adding ``financial resources'' to the existing physical
and mental qualifications which must be reviewed in making a determination that a worker is able to undertake and complete
training, as set out for criterion (E) in Section G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 and incorporated in this final
rule. This change was made to enhance the worker's ability to complete training by stressing that the duration of approved
training should be commensurate with the worker's financial resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training may be approved for a duration not to exceed 104 weeks under a single certification, as limited in amended
&sect;617.22(f)(2). However, combined UI and TRA entitlement is available to workers for a maximum of 78 weeks. When
the duration of training exceeds the remaining weeks of UI and TRA payments, a worker's income support may end or be
substantially reduced before completing the approved training program. This situation often results in workers
dropping out of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended &sect;617.22(a)(5) will require State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff to explain to workers seeking approval of training in which the duration of training exceeds their remaining
weeks of UI and TRA payments, that in the absence of other financial resources such training may not be appropriate.
When the worker's financial resources are not commensurate with a training program suitable to the worker, the training
requirement may be waived under &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B).

K. Revision of &sect;617.22(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual who satisfies the six criteria for approval of training in &sect;617.22(a) may be enrolled in a training
program that does not exceed 104 weeks in length. (See &sect;617.22(f)(2).) Inquiries were received on whether an
individual may pursue more than one training program under a single certification or whether training under a certification
is limited by the 104-weeks time provision. To eliminate any uncertainty on this matter, clause (2) on length of training
has been revised to state more clearly that the maximum duration for any approvable training program is 104 weeks and
no individual shall be entitled to more than one training program under a single certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of part 617, a new clause (3) is added to &sect;617.22(f), which provides a definition for a ``training
program''. Subclause (i) of clause (3) provides that a training program may consist of a single course or a group of
courses designed and approved by the State agency for an individual to meet a specific occupational goal. Subclause
(ii) of clause (3) authorizes State agencies to amend an individual's approved training program, when the duration
of training is less than 104 weeks, to add a course or courses designed to satisfy unforeseen needs, such as the need
for remedial education or specific occupational skills. However, the amended training program may not exceed the
104-week time limitation in clause (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clause (4), previously clause (3), is amended to clarify that the hours in a day and the days in a week an individual attends
an approved training program must be full time commensurate with the standards of the training facility. The purpose
of this amendment is to ensure that hours of training per week and length of the training program are scheduled in a manner
that the individual will develop the skills needed to achieve a specific occupational goal in a reasonable time period
and at a reasonable cost. Any week in which training is less than full time will still count as a full week for the purposes

L. Revision of &sect;617.26
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.26, entitled ``Approval of other training including interstate,'' was not among the sections of regulations
proposed to be amended in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988. However, rethinking occasioned by the
1988 Amendments led to the conclusion that there is a need to clarify, and in some respects alter, the roles and responsibilities
of liable States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. Among the OTCA amendments that caused such
rethinking were those making training an entitlement and an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, and the provisions
of amended section 231(c) on training waivers. In addition, comments received on related sections of the proposed
regulations were considered in reaching this conclusion. The redescription of liable State and agent State roles
and responsibilities was announced in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90, which was published at 56 FR 46331, 46332. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;617.26, written in 1975, provides that the agent State shall be responsible for the selection and
approval of training, and will pay any training related costs, and that the liable State is responsible for determining
eligibility for TRA, job search and relocation allowances, and may approve and purchase training provided that certain
conditions are met. Although the respective roles of the liable and agent States were spelled out, the section was
silent on the legal relationships and the appellate authority in the case of determinations made by the agent State.
In addition, there were some overlapping responsibilities relative to training approval and payment of training
costs. The regulations as revised in this document address these issues and, in general, deal more comprehensively
with the roles and responsibilities of liable and agent States in administering the TAA program. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.26 is retitled ``Liable and agent State responsibilities'' and the roles of liable and agent States are
delineated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After examining State practices, as affected by the OTCA amendments, the Department has concluded that, as a general
rule, the agent State should continue to be responsible for procuring and paying for TAA approved training and related
costs, including subsistence and transportation, as appropriate. In addition, the agent State shall assist the
liable State in fulfilling its responsibilities for making determinations of entitlement to all TAA program benefits.
These changes are reflected in revised &sect;617.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another significant change in &sect;617.26 is in making the liable State responsible for all determinations, redeterminations,
and decisions on appeals pertaining to any worker's eligibility for or entitlement to any TAA program benefit under
Part 617. This includes determinations relating to training approval, disapproval, waivers and revocation of waivers
for training, and training related costs including subsistence and transportation. This requirement will preclude
due process objections which could be raised if workers were required to appeal some issues under the agent State law
and other issues under the liable State law. Responsibility for selection and approval of training no longer resides
in the agent State, as is provided in the present rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a liable State and an agent State may jointly agree to modify this rule with respect to their TAA administrative
functions, but any such change must comply with the legal requirement that all determinations will be under the authority
of the liable State, and all appeals by individuals will be under the law of the liable State. Further, prior approval
for any such modification must be obtained under &sect;617.54. (See also &sect;&sect;617.33 and 617.44, below.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, in those situations where two or more States share a common labor market area and workers commute across
State lines for work, those States may wish to develop cooperative arrangements, consistent with revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.26, and approved under &sect;617.54, to provide TAA ser-vices to adversely affected workers in the area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``liable State'' at &sect;617.3(aa) is also revised to conform with changes in &sect;&sect;617.16,
617.26, 617.33 and 617.44, and a definition is added for ``agent State''. (The term ``applicable State,'' which is
defined and used in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90, is not used in this final rule. It was decided that the terms ``liable
State'' and ``agent State,'' and the definition of ``applicable State law'' in &sect;617.16 were adequate to cover
the rules associated with interstate responsibilities without adding a further definition of ``applicable State.'')

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As revised in this final rule, &sect;617.26 comprehensively addresses the roles and responsibilities of liable
States and agent States in interstate cases, clarifies the legal and appellate relationships among the States, and
assures due process for workers and conformance with section 239(d) of the Act. With this revision, and other changes
in the rules, there is consistency among the regulations in addressing State responsibilities: &sect;617.16 covers
applicable State law; &sect;617.20 addresses State responsibilities for the delivery of reemployment services,
in general; &sect;617.33 addresses findings required before final payment of a job search allowance is made by the
liable State; &sect;617.44 addresses findings required before final payment of a relocation allowance is made by
the liable State; and &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 speak to determinations of entitlement, and appeals and hearings
under the applicable State law, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is made in &sect;617.50(a) by striking the clause ``, or the State agency as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.26(d),''.

Section 617.33 prescribes the findings required before final payment of a job search allowance is made to an eligible
worker by the liable State. It describes the responsibilities of liable and agent States in regard to those findings.

This section is revised to delineate more clearly the responsibilities of liable and agent States for determinations
(and appeal rights) regarding relocation allowances.

O. Revision of &sect;617.50(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 617.50(d) contains the rules on the use of State law and regulations in making and reviewing determinations
and redeterminations under part 617. Questions have arisen in at least two States whether the 210-day time limit in
&sect;617.15(b) (and section 233(b) of the Act) may be waived for good cause, or whether State law provisions on good
cause for late filing of UI claims may be applied. The Department has consistently taken the position that such good
cause provisions may not be applied, in view of the lack of authority for doing so in any provision of the Act or the regulations.
Nevertheless, State authorities in one State have ruled a number of times that there can be good cause for late filing.
And more recently, in a matter arising in another State, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision adverse
to the position of the Department. Because the Department believes that conclusions inconsistent with its longstanding
position do not comport with the Act, it has decided to address the issue in a broad manner and state as clearly as possible
in the regulations the precise situations in which State laws may be applicable in addressing issues arising under
the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sixth Circuit's decision started with the proposition that the Trade Act of 1974 was passed by the Congress ``during
a mood of congressional largesse,'' and that the 210-day rule in section 233(b) of the Act ``was not intended to act
as a jurisdictional prerequisite to additional TRA benefits.'' From this premise it reasoned that ``the purpose
of the rule is to discourage dilatory'' conduct by applicants, and that absent a finding of dilatory conduct ``the
application of the 210-day rule does nothing to further the Act's remedial purpose and everything to frustrate it''.
Citing another holding in the District of Columbia Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held that the Department's ``interpretation
makes sense only if there was a congressional policy in favor of limiting TRA benefits.'' The Sixth Circuit concluded
that: ``That court found no evidence of such a policy. Nor do we.'' From this line of reasoning the Sixth Circuit held
that the State's ``waiver for good cause rule [is applicable] in this context''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes the Sixth Circuit erred in relying upon the ``mood of congressional largesse'' in passing
the 1974 Act, without taking into account the critical redirection in the 1981 amendments away from TRA and towards
greater emphasis upon training (including changing the 233(b) rule from 180 days to 210 days), and the direct linkage
in the 1988 Amendments of training and eligibility for basic TRA (as well as additional TRA). In this context, there
is a sound reason for upholding the ``jurisdictional'' nature of the 210-day rule, and less reason for reaching out
to State law for a good cause exception, as distinguished from fashioning an exception from the language of Section
233(b). For these reasons, the Department believes the Sixth Circuit's decision was incorrect. The Department is
therefore moving to clarify the regulations to make its interpretation of the Act clearer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering where in the regulations the clarification of the Department's position should be made, the Department
took into account the fact that there are other time limits expressed in the regulations, such as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;617.10(b), 617.31(c), 617.41(c), and 617.43(b). Since all such time limits may be vulnerable to the
same deviations that occurred with respect to the 210-day time limit, it was decided that a general rule was needed
that is applicable to all of part 617. The placement of this general rule thus fell logically in paragraph (d) of &sect;617.50.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, paragraph (d) of &sect;617.50 is amended to add the general rule that no provision of State law or regulations
as to good cause for waiver of any time limit or for late filing of any claim shall apply in the case of any time limitation
stated in part 617, unless such State law or regulation is made applicable by a specific provision of part 617. This
change eliminates any uncertainty about the Department's position, and places a clear obligation on the States to
adhere to the time limitations in all of part 617.

P. Revision of &sect;617.55
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 243 of the Act, on Fraud and Recovery of Overpayments, is interpreted as being drawn in broad terms so as to impose
liability for repayment of all improper payments under the Act, and to impose penalties for all false statements or
representations resulting in improper payments. Subsection (a) imposes repayment liability upon any ``person''
receiving an improper payment, whereas subsections (b) and (c) use the term ``individual'' in the fraud and recovery
provisions. In &sect;617.55, in contrast, the term ``individual'' is used throughout the liability, fraud, and
waiver provisions of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent experience in the administration of the TAA program has highlighted the difference between ``person'' and
``individual'' as such terms are commonly understood in other areas of law. The term ``person'' is more comprehensive,
and may include an employer or other entity or organization as well as an individual, whereas the term ``individual''
as used throughout part 617 typically means the individual workers who are the beneficiaries of the program. The question
that arose was whether &sect;617.55(a) was sufficiently broad in wording to impose repayment liability upon an employer
who had received improper payments for the on-the-job training. In examining this issue it became apparent that the
same issue existed with respect to payments for training of individuals that are made directly to training providers.
Although the payments in both cases may be said to be made on behalf of the individual workers, it is evident that, in
many cases (particularly in the case of on-the-job training), liability for repayment as well as responsibility
for fraud is more properly assignable primarily to the employer and possibly the training provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify the regulations, and to reflect the broad interpretation given to section 243 of the Act, &sect;617.55
is revised throughout to make it specifically applicable to any person or individual, and paragraph (i) is added to
define person as any employer or other entity or organization as well as the officers and officials thereof who may
bear individual responsibility.

Q. Revision of &sect;617.60
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new &sect;617.60, on Administrative requirements, was included in the proposed rule published on November 30,
1988, for comment. Although no comments were received, the substance of several of the provisions are affected by
other administrative regulations. Since further work is required to bring the TAA administrative requirements
into full conformity with those other regulations, the decision was made to reserve &sect;617.60 for use when the
revised TAA administrative requirements are completed and published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
R. Revision of &sect;617.64
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1986 Amendments to the Trade Act, section 285 was amended by, among other things, adding a subsection (b), to
provide that ``no assistance, allowance, or other payments may be provided under chapter 2 *&blank;*&blank;* after
September 30, 1991.'' This new subsection (b) superseded the current provisions in &sect;617.64, which were consistent
with the amendments made by section 2512 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. Section 1426(a) of the OTCA
extended the termination of the program to September 30, 1993. While the 1986 and 1988 amendments to the TAA program
changed the termination dates to September 30, 1991 and 1993, respectively, appropriate changes were not made to
&sect;617.64 concerning the payment of TAA program benefits after the termination date in the Act. Therefore, &sect;617.64
is amended to bring it into accord with the amended language in section 285 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A strict construction of the law, prohibiting the actual payment of TAA program benefits to individuals after the
termination date in the Act, would have a profound effect on those persons who completed approved TAA program services,
but, because of State processing requirements, payment for such services cannot be made by the State agency until
after the termination date in the Act. This strict construction would unnecessarily make the orderly termination
of the program impossible. It would deny payment of benefits to individuals for the period prior to the termination
date of the program simply because it was administratively infeasible to make the payment before the termination
date. Therefore, in order to avoid these untoward results stemming from a strict construction, a more liberal construction
of section 285(b) is necessary to effectuate the Congressional intent. A ``payment,'' within the meaning of section
285(b), will be deemed to have been made before the termination date of the program, if a final determination on the
amount payable to, or on behalf of, the individual for TAA program services was made on or before the termination date
of the program, for which payment was due.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This means that State agency approved job search and relocation, and training related transportation and subsistence,
must be completed on or before the termination date in the Act and that the State make a final determination on the amount
of TAA program funds payable to the individual on or before such termination date. This places the requirement on the
State agency to inform all individuals presently approved for such benefits of the statutory time provision that
the service must be completed and a final determination on the amount payable made on or before the termination date
of the program. It also places a requirement on individuals to complete the approved services and to submit all claims
for such activities to the State agency in time to receive a final determination on the amount payable on or before the
termination date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals approved for training who began approved training on or before the termination date in the Act must have
a final determination by the State agency on or before the termination date on the amount due and payable for the training
costs to cover previously incurred tuition and related expenses. Determinations on tuition shall be limited to the
current training term, quarter, semester, or other scheduled period, and be in accord with normal billing practices
of the training provider and payment practices of the State agency. In order to conform with the intent of the law, the
State agency may make a final determination on the amount payable only for the training term, quarter, semester or
other time period for which payment is due and payable on or before the termination date of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals entering training, and those currently in training programs which extend beyond the termination date
of the program, should be informed that no payments will be authorized or made for any costs or expenses which become
due and payable after the termination date of the program, nor will any such costs or expenses be paid prior to the expiration
date of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, only the last full TRA benefit week, for which a final determination has been made according to normal State
UI processing procedures on or before the termination date of the program, will be paid to any individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a claim for TRA is submitted to the State agency subsequent to the termination date in the Act, or for which a final
determination on the amount payable has not been made on or prior to the termination date of the program, the State agency
is required to issue a ``no-payment'' determination on the claim because the State may not refuse to take and process
the claim even though it is prohibited by statute from paying the claim. These provisions apply also to claims for job
search allowances under &sect;617.33 and for relocation allowances under &sect;617.44.

Discussion of Comments and Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the proposed rule, the Department received written comments from two State Governors, fourteen State
employment security agencies, three labor unions, and one public interest group.

Eligibility period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (PDLI) recommended that clause (i) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.3(m)(1) (defining ``eligibility period'' for basic TRA) be amended by removing the word ``first'' after
the word ``individual'' in the seventh line, and by removing all language after the parenthetical clause ``(as defined
in paragraph (oo)(1) of this section).'' The PDLI stated that these deletions are necessary for the regulation to
conform to the eligibility requirement of Section 233(a)(2) prior to its amendment by the OTCA. The International
Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) commented that the proposed
rule incorrectly ties the eligibility period for basic TRA to the date on which the first qualifying separation occurs,
and the reference to eligibility period, therefore, should be omitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that these comments reflect an incorrect view of the 1981 Amendments and the effect of the
1988 Amendments in the OTCA. The Department construes the 1981 Amendments as setting the beginning of the eligibility
period as the week immediately following the week in which regular benefits are exhausted following the worker's
first qualifying separation. This is explicitly provided for in section 233(a)(2), as amended in 1981, and is set
forth in the Department's regulations implementing the 1981 Amendments. The only change in this provision of the
law was the extension of the eligibility period from 52 weeks to 104 weeks in the 1986 Amendments. No change was made
in the fixed eligibility period until the 1988 Amendments, which restored the movable eligibility period based on
the most recent qualifying total separation. Therefore, in &sect;617.3(m)(1), the fixed eligibility period is
retained for first qualifying separations that occurred before August 23, 1988. The new movable eligibility period
is also implemented, in accordance with the 1988 Amendments, for decisions made on or after August 23, 1988, for other
qualifying total separations which occurred before, on, or after August 23, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1430(g) of the OTCA provides for the retention of the pre-OTCA eligibility period which was established by
the first qualifying separation occurring before August 23, 1988, even if the decision is made on or after August 23,
1988. Amended section 233(a)(2) may not be applied in a decision made on or after August 23, 1988, in the case of a more
recent total separation occurring before August 23, 1988, if the effect of applying such amended section would result
in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period established on the basis of an earlier first qualifying separation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is essential to retain the definition of eligibility period for the application of prior law with respect to first
qualifying separations which occurred before August 23, 1988, while adding a definition of the new eligibility period
for qualifying separations to which amended section 233(a)(2) is applicable. If, however, the adversely affected
worker is totally separated on or after August 23, 1988, following a first qualifying separation which occurred prior
to August 23, 1988, amended section 233(a)(2) must be applied even though it results in an earlier expiration date
of the eligibility period established under pre-OTCA law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no substantive change is made in paragraph (m)(1)(i) of &sect;617.3, but as noted below substantive changes
are made in paragraphs (m) and (t) as a result of the new interpretations of sections 1430 (a) and (g) of the OTCA, and
to correct technical errors.

Application of new eligibility period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UAW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that in &sect;617.3(m)(1) the Department set up two standards for the 104-week eligibility period during
which TRA is payable. The UAW argues that the proposed two standards differ according to whether the date of separation
occurred before or after August 23, 1988. The UAW commented that Congress explicitly provided in section 1430(g)
of the OTCA that the revised definition of the 104-week eligibility period in section 1425(a) (amending section 233(a)(2))
was effective upon enactment unless the application of the amended eligibility period would reduce the period for
which a worker would have been eligible for TRA. Therefore, the two standards should not turn on the date of the worker's
separation, but on whether or not the worker's period of eligibility is reduced through the application of the amended
eligibility period. The UAW commented further that Congress intended the amendment to be fully effective upon enactment,
permitting the amendment to increase the eligibility period for basic TRA or establish a TRA eligibility period for
some workers, and noted that the Conference agreement statements in House Conference Report 100&hyph;576 on sections
1425 and 1430 of the OTCA strongly support this application of the amendments. The UAW also commented that under OTCA
sections 1425(a) and 1430(g) the most recent total separation which is qualifying must be used to determine the eligibility
period, unless the eligibility period would be shortened through the application of the amendment to workers separated
prior to enactment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDLI, commenting on the transition guidelines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.67(e)(3), noted that section 1430(g), in specifically referring to total separations prior to the enactment
of the OTCA, raised the unavoidable implication that amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied to total separations
prior to August 23, 1988, if such application would provide the worker with a longer or later eligibility period than
the worker would have had under the pre-OTCA law. The Unemployment Council of Southwestern Pennsylvania made the
same point in its comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees with the commenters' understanding that the amendment to the basic TRA eligibility period
is not to operate to the disadvantage of workers whose eligibility period would expire at a later date with respect
to a qualifying separation which occurred before the date of enactment of the amendment to section 233(a)(2). These
comments were also a factor in the Department's reconsideration of GAL 7&hyph;88 and the resulting new interpretations
of sections 1430(a) and 1430(g) announced in GAL 15&hyph;90 (see discussion in item A. above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If workers are to retain the advantage of a later expiration date for the eligibility period based on the prior law,
then the prior law must continue to be applied to first qualifying separations which occur before the date of enactment
of the OTCA (August 23, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in general the comments have merit, and substantial changes are made in the final regulations regarding
the definition of ``eligibility period'' in &sect;617.3(m)(1) and the definitions of ``separations'' in &sect;617.3(t).
Furthermore, the transition provisions at &sect;617.67(e) also have been revised to reflect the Department's new
interpretations of sections 1430(a) and 1430(g). For further clarification, a proviso directly implementing section
1430(g) of the OTCA is added to &sect;617.3(m)(1).

The PDLI stated that &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) does not clearly point out why weeks of training prior to approval cannot
be paid. The PDLI asked ``What if the trainee, for example, was in JTPA funded training that would be, after approval,
either paid for by TAA or continued under JTPA?''

Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This comment suggests a misunderstanding of the TAA program and the effects of the 1988 Amendments and earlier changes.
Since the addition of section 236(a)(3) (now 236(a)(4)) in the 1986 Amendments, the switching of training costs from
other funds to TAA funds has to be subject to the controls set out in that section. In the 1988 Amendments those controls
were retained, and authority was added to mix TAA funding with funding from other public and private sources and to
use funding solely from other sources for TAA training. That is why, in GAL 15&hyph;90 (and earlier in GAL 7&hyph;88)
and in amended &sect;617.25, greater emphasis is given to entering into prearrangements for sharing the costs of
training with other funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. With training becoming an eligibility requirement for basic TRA in the 1988 Amendments, the same emphasis
upon prospective treatment must now be given to basic TRA as has been given to additional TRA and, to a somewhat lesser
extent, TAA funds for training. Additional TRA has not been paid for retroactive weeks, nor, under &sect;617.22(c),
have previously incurred training costs been payable from TAA funds. This same rule must now be applied to basic TRA,
as well as additional TRA and TAA training funds, and it is this rule that is reflected in amended &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii)
as well as in amended &sect;617.22(c). Under the 1988 Amendments, therefore, TAA funding will not follow automatically
from approval of training under &sect;617.22(a), nor will approval of training that commenced before approval under
&sect;617.22(a) imply or justify payment of previously incurred training costs from TAA funds, or payment of any
TRA for any week that ended before such approval was documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, no substantive change is made in the final regulations to accord with PDLI's comment. Changes
are made in &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii), as well as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(c), however, for purposes of stating the prospective rule as clearly as possible and to furnish a regulatory
response to the PDLI's multi-faceted question.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retroactive payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (OBES) commented that &sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) specifies that the eligibility
period, during which additional weeks of TRA are payable to a worker in approved training, if such training is approved
after the training commences, begins with the first week such training is approved. Approval of such training after
the training has commenced shall not be deemed to authorize the payment of TRA for any week which ended before such approval
was documented. The OBES explained that, at the present time, many individuals are enrolled in training programs
which were not TAA approvable prior to the 1988 Amendments because the costs of training were paid with non-appropriated
funds. While these individuals are being made aware of the change in the law that now authorizes the use of non-appropriated
funds to pay the costs of training, there are unavoidable delays in documenting sources of training funds and approving
the training under part 617. These delays result in lost worker eligibility for weeks of additional TRA. OBES recommends
that the final rule provide for retroactive payment of the additional weeks of TRA in such cases, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least to the date of application for approval of such training. Sections 617.22(c) and 617.67(f) would also need to
be modified for this purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OBES presented the problem as one that existed at the time the letter was written; that is, when the OBES's comments
were made in December 1988. Although the Department understands that such a problem may have existed in late August
and in September 1988, the operating instructions in GAL 7&hyph;88 were issued to State agencies some three months
before the OBES comments were made. Accordingly, the Department has decided not to relax its long-standing rule against
retroactive payments expressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(c). See discussion under the preceding item. It was not expected that the new authorization for sharing
costs of training would furnish a viable solution to all existing cases. One of the safeguards built into the new system
was to require that sharing of costs be under conditions arranged before the training was approved under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22 and undertaken by the worker. There is no intent to approve the payment of additional TRA for weeks a worker
is not actually participating in training nor to approve retroactive payments that are not allowable under &sect;617.22
(c). The expectation is that cooperating agencies will enter into shared cost prearrangements for training not funded
wholly from TAA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department has decided to make no change in the regulations in response to this comment, but notes under
item 3 that clarifying technical changes are being made in &sect;&sect;617.3(m)(2)(iii) and 617.22(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifying separations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (MDLIR) commented on paragraphs (t)(1), (t)(2)(ii) and
(t)(3)(ii) of &sect;617.3 in the proposed rule, which define ``first separation'', ``qualifying separation'',
and ``first qualifying separation''. Since a worker must have a total separation on or after August 23, 1988 to qualify
for TRA, the MDLIR asked why the definition of ``partial separation'' should not be eliminated if it takes a total separation
to establish eligibility for TRA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department retained the definition of ``partial separation'' because the qualifying requirements in section
231(a)(1) and (2) continue to permit workers to have a total or partial separation from employment to qualify for TRA
prior to August 23, 1988, and for TAA services other than TRA whether a separation occurs before or after August 23,
1988. The amended law does not require that a worker have a total qualifying separation on or after August 23, 1988,
in order to qualify for basic or additional TRA for weeks beginning after August 23, 1988. Workers will continue to
be eligible for basic and additional TRA after August 23, 1988, based on a partial or total qualifying separation that
occurred before August 23 under the prior law. Although the amended law requires that a qualifying separation must
be a total separation to qualify initially for basic TRA (or to move the eligibility period based on a prior qualifying
separation under the same certification), a partial qualifying separation will be used for purposes other than the
basic TRA eligibility period. For example, under &sect;617.15(b) an application for training must be filed within
210 days after the date of the worker's total or partial separation referred to in Section 231(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1). (See item E. above, and item 25, below, concerning changes to &sect;617.15(b) on the application of the 210-day
rule.) Further, the weekly and maximum amounts of TRA payable to an individual are based on the first total or partial
separation. However, with respect to qualifying separations to which amended section 233(a)(2) applies, a worker's
eligibility period for basic TRA is based on total separations only.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering this comment, however, an error was discovered in paragraph (t)(3) of &sect;617.3, which did not give
proper effect to a partial separation on or after August 23, 1988. Therefore, in addition to other changes as discussed
above, paragraph (t)(3) is amended in this final rule to accord with the above response to this comment. For the same
reason a parallel change is made in &sect;617.67(e)(4).

TRA weekly and maximum. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In commenting on the application of amended section 233(a)(2) to the most recent total qualifying separation, in
determining the eligibility period of a worker, the UAW argued that this contrasts with the determination of weekly
and maximum amounts of TRA, which does require the use of ``first qualifying separation.'' The proper use of ``first
qualifying separation'' is restricted to the determination of the weekly and maximum amounts of TRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that determinations of TRA weekly benefit amounts and maximum benefit amounts, under sections
232(a) and 233(a)(1), will continue to be based on the first total or partial separation, and that this was not changed
by the 1988 Amendments. What this means is that monetary determinations of TRA entitlement may have to be based upon
two separations which occurred in different years. For example, for a period of up to three years or more after August
23, 1988 (the impact date to termination date of a certification plus the time between petition and certification
dates can be a period of up to or in excess of three years), it is possible that a worker will have had a first qualifying
separation before August 23, 1988, and computations under sections 232(a) and 233(a)(1) will be based upon UI entitlement
in the first benefit period following such first separation, whereas the worker's most recent total qualifying separation
will be used to determine the basic TRA eligibility period. This is simply illustrative, however, because in all cases
decided on or after August 23, 1988, the eligibility period under amended section 233(a)(2) will be based upon the
most recent ``total qualifying separation,'' whereas computations of weekly and maximum TRA amounts under sections
232(a) and 233(a)(1) will continue to be based on the first separation with respect to which the worker is entitled
to UI, whether such separation occurred before or after August 23, 1988. This is an additional reason why, for any worker
who is determined to have had a ``total qualifying separation,'' it will be necessary to establish whether the worker
had an earlier first separation under the same certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``first qualifying separation'' in paragraph (t)(3) of &sect;617.3 incorrectly relates determinations
of weekly and maximum TRA amounts only to first qualifying separations with respect to which the worker also qualifies
for TRA. This is corrected in the final regulations, and other technical corrections are made to distinguish between
``first separation'' and the meaning of ``first qualifying separation'' for its two purposes; that is, (a) eligibility
period for TRA, and (b) computation of weekly and maximum TRA amounts.

Partial separations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indiana Department of Employment and Training Services (IDETS) commented that, based on its understanding of
&sect;617.3(t)(3)(ii) of the proposed rule, and sections 233(a)(1) and 231(a)(3)(A) of the Act, there appears to
be a conflict over whether a partial separation after August 23, 1988, may be used to determine benefit amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IDETS is correct in noting this error in paragraph (t)(3) of &sect;617.3. See the discussion under the preceding
two items. The first separation under a single certification, with respect to which the worker is entitled to UI, must
be used to determine the worker's weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA, whether such first separation occurs before
or after August 23, 1988. As noted in the preceding two items, &sect;617.3(t) is modified to clarify this and other
points.

Advice to workers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vermont Department of Employment and Training (VDET) commented on &sect;617.4 concerning what constitutes
proper advice and assistance to workers. The VDET stated that the requirement to inform each worker applying for unemployment
insurance ``of the procedures and deadlines for applying for such benefits'' taken literally includes a large number
of applicants who are applying for short term UI benefits and who in no way are likely to be eligible for benefits under
the TAA program. The VDET argues that while it is important that the State agency take the initiative to inform workers
who may be eligible for the benefits, the current language is too rigid, and will only cause confusion among short term
unemployed. The Vermont agency recommended that the requirement be rephrased to require States to develop the means
to identify trade eligible workers who apply for UI and then provide the necessary information to those workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that State agencies should identify potential trade eligible workers as early as possible
in their benefit period. However, section 239(f) of the Act provides, among other things, that each worker who applies
for unemployment insurance shall be advised of the benefits under the TAA provisions of the Trade Act and the procedures
and deadlines to apply for such benefits. There is no language which would support the limitation suggested by the
VDET. Often temporary layoffs by a firm adversely affected by import competition or other economic conditions become
permanent. The intent of Congress is to ensure that such workers are made aware early in their unemployment experience
of the TAA program, how to apply for benefits, and the services available to them. Many State UI agencies furnish an
information bulletin or brochure to every worker who files a claim for UI. These bulletins or brochures should include
full and correct information on the amended TAA program, and on the benefits and services available to unemployed
workers. The Department is encouraging all State agencies to publish a brochure for handout to workers filing initial
claims for UI. State agencies should revise their previously used brochures to accurately reflect all the changes
made in this final rule, and furnish a copy to each worker who files an initial claim for UI as required by section 239(f)
since August 23, 1988.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While no change is made in the final regulations regarding the requirement of advising all UI claimants of the TAA program,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice to workers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Michigan Employment Security Commission (MESC) explained that &sect;617.4(d)(1)(ii)(A) states that notices
to workers must include information as to the article(s) produced. The MESC commented that unless the article(s)
produced is part of the certification statement, e.g. ``all workers producing shock absorbers,'' referring to it
will often confuse rather than clarify worker coverage. For example, if the certification covers ``all workers of
XYZ Company,'' to state in the worker notice that the company ``produces shock absorbers,'' will confuse workers
of the XYZ Company who may have produced brakes. Unless a specific article is identified in the published certification
document, it should not be required information in the notice to workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department concurs with the comment. The articles produced are to be specified in a notice to the workers only when
there is a specific reference in the published certification document to an article or articles. When all workers
in the firm are covered by the certification it is not necessary to identify the article(s) produced. The regulation
is modified at &sect;617.4(d)(1)(ii)(A) to reflect this change, and the same change is made in &sect;617.4(d)(2)(ii)(A)
regarding newspaper notices.

Identifying workers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The New York Department of Labor (NYDL) commented that &sect;617.4(d)(1) expands the intent of the Trade Act by specifying
the sources that the State agency should utilize in identifying adversely affected workers. The NYDL stated that
it is inappropriate to specify such sources in a regulation and suggested that the Department adhere to the language
of the Act. It also suggested the following substitute language: ``The state agency shall provide written notice,
through the mail, of benefits available under this chapter to each worker whom the State agency has reason to believe
is covered by a certification made under subchapter A of this chapter. The notice must include the following information:
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule merely refers to any other reliable sources of information other than the workers' firm. When a firm
closes, information from the firm's records may be difficult to obtain. In this case, as well as others, the State agency
should obtain the best information available to it. This level of specificity seems appropriate for the regulations.
Similarly, in implementing the provision on the scope of the notice to be given, the Department has concluded that
amended Section 225 requires that all workers who can be identified shall receive such notice. Therefore, no change
is made in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Newspaper notices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OBES commented that &sect;617.4(d)(2) requires State agencies to publish a notice of each certification issued
in its State in a newspaper of general circulation in the areas in which the affected workers reside. OBES further commented
that it is not uncommon that prior to the State agency being informed of a certification by the Department of Labor all
affected workers have already learned of the certification and have reported to the State agency to file for TAA benefits.
Therefore, OBES recommended that the final rule provide for a waiver of the public notice requirement when it can be
verified by the State agency that all the affected workers have filed for TAA benefits. The OBES also recommended that
the funding source for such newspaper notices be identified formally. The California Employment Development Department
(CEDD) provided similar comments on &sect;617.4(d)(2). CEDD pointed out that there is no useful purpose in placing
an expensive newspaper ad when all affected workers are notified by letter, or when the ad will very likely not be seen
by any of the former workers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that a newspaper notice is not needed in some situations because all the workers are identified
by the State agency and notified by mail. This situation occurs frequently when the certified worker group is small.
Therefore, the Department is amending the final rule at &sect;617.4(d)(2) to authorize State agencies to dispense
with the newspaper notice when it can be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and is

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
documented
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

a waiver of the training requirement and the procedure for doing so.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that the regulations as proposed establish the right of workers to waivers of the training
requirement in appropriate cases, and provide for appeal and review of determinations on such waivers. State agencies
will initiate waivers where training is not feasible or appropriate. Information that waivers will be issued to workers
when training is not appropriate or feasible must be furnished to the workers or be included in the bulletin or brochure
furnished to each worker under paragraph (e)(1) of &sect;617.4. The Department does not believe that more specificity
is required in paragraph (e)(1). Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.

 The CEDD, commenting on &sect;617.4(e), stated that there is some confusion between this section and &sect;617.67(c)(2).
The CEDD commented that it is not clear whether TAA information must be provided to every individual who applies for
unemployment insurance, as stated in &sect;617.67(c)(2), or just to those certified as adversely affected as implied
by use of the word ``worker'' in &sect;617.4(e). The CEDD recommended, if States are to provide TAA information to
all individuals filing for UI, this requirement should be clearly identified in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not believe that the regulations are ambiguous on this issue. The 1988 Amendments to section 239(f)
state that every worker filing for UI is to be informed of the TAA program and the benefits available, even though the
worker may not qualify for TAA. The regulations at &sect;&sect;617.4(e)(1) and 617.67(c)(2) clearly state that
each worker who applies for UI shall be advised of the benefits available under the TAA program and does not confine
such advice to workers who have been identified as adversely affected by imports. Therefore, no change is made in the
regulations.

 The OBES commented that &sect;617.4(e)(1) requires State agencies to advise each worker who files for unemployment
insurance of TAA benefits available and the deadlines for applying for such benefits. The OBES requested that the
final rule replace the term ``deadlines'' with ``time limits''. The final rule should also establish the administrative
funding mechanism for the substantial costs associated with implementing this requirement. CEDD also commented
on a funding issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations at &sect;617.4(e)(1) track the language of section 239(f)(1) of the Trade Act, which provides that
workers shall be informed of the ``deadlines'' for applying for TAA benefits. Matters of administrative funding
are addressed in program letters and other issuances of the Department and will be addressed further in &sect;617.60
when it is published. (See explanation on the publication of &sect;617.60 in item Q. above.) No special funding category
is contemplated for furnishing information and assistance to applicants and potential applicants. Therefore,
no change is made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CEDD, commenting on &sect;617.10(d), stated that this section contains a statement about providing ``workers''
with TAA information at the time the UI claim is filed. The CEDD argues that, if the rule means every individual who files

when the worker files an initial UI claim.

Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1988 Amendments require the State agency to inform every worker filing an initial UI claim about the TAA program
and the benefits available under it. There are no exceptions to this rule. One of the purposes of the amendment is to
ensure that workers are informed of the program at that time so they can file a petition for TAA if they wish, whether
or not a petition has been filed or a certification issued covering that worker or others. See &sect;617.4(e). The
Department believes this requirement can be met easily by furnishing an information bulletin or brochure on the TAA
program to every worker who files an initial UI claim. See discussion in item 8, above. Therefore, no change is made
in the final regulations.

Legal work requirement.

 The UAW commented that the proposed rules at &sect;617.11(a)(1)(iii)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(C) are not reflected in
any provision of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, nor in the 1988 Amendments. The UAW stated that the Department is
trying to enforce the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) with this provision. The UAW argued that if Congress
wished to enact such a provision it could have, but it did not do so. IRCA did not implicitly amend other federal laws.
The Department should not amend the TAA program to enforce IRCA in the absence of statutory authority and therefore
the referenced subparagraphs should be deleted entirely.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 The content of &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(1)(iii)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(C) is not changed by reason of the 1988 Amendments.
These sections of the regulations merely restate a requirement which has been in the TAA regulations since they were
issued in 1975 in a different place within the regulations. No substantive change has been made in this regulatory
requirement. These provisions do not implement the IRCA. Therefore, no change is made to the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NYDL recommended that &sect;617.11(a)(1)(vii) on the job search program (JSP) be deleted from the regulations
since retroactive TRA claims approved for weeks prior to November 21, 1988, will no longer require participation
in a JSP. After November 21, 1988, individuals involved will not know about the requirement. The UAW made a similar
comment on the JSP requirement. However, the UAW commented further that this proposed rule creates a likelihood that
workers will not be informed by State agencies of the deletion of this requirement in the 1988 Amendments since the
Department is ``encouraging'' States to continue the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Various provisions of the 1988 Amendments became effective on different dates. The proposed rule was structured
to address those statutory requirements that applied prior to, and apply on and after November 21, 1988. The JSP requirement
was applicable through November 20, 1988. The training requirement became applicable on November 21, 1988. Therefore,
it is essential to delineate the statutory requirements for each time period, and set them forth clearly in these regulations.
Also, appeal actions may be pending on workers who were denied TRA eligibility because they failed to begin participation
in or failed to complete a JSP. Some of these cases could eventually be resolved in the courts. The retention of the regulations
on the JSP will continue to provide the basis for supporting determinations made by State agencies during the period
the JSP requirement was applicable. In the proposed rule, a new paragraph was added to &sect;617.49, specifically
providing that JSP is not a requirement for any week which begins after November 20, 1988, and this provision is included
in the final regulations. In addition, the Department believes that a JSP is a very useful employability service for
adversely affected workers and should be encouraged. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OBES commented that &sect;617.11(a)(3)(iii) specifies that State agencies are to take into account local labor
market characteristics in giving effect to the terms seasonal employment and part-time, temporary work. The OBES
recommended that the final rule should provide a definition of temporary work to ensure uniformity among and between
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted in item D. above, the Department decided to add to the regulations definitions of the terms ``seasonal employment'',
``odd jobs'', and ``part-time, temporary employment'', to provide State agencies with guiding instructions for
implementing section 1426(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the OTCA, so that the Department, rather than the States, defines the
limits of Federal liability under &sect;617.11(a)(3) as under other aspects of the TAA program. The explanation
for each of these definitions is noted in item D. In more specific response to the commenter, notice that the definitions
go beyond simply defining temporary work separate and apart from ``part-time, temporary employment'' as used in
the statute. To fit into this category, as is made clear in the amended regulation, such work must be both part-time
and temporary.

Enrolled in training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Governor of North Dakota and the Job Service of North Dakota, commenting on &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii), point out
that the definition for ``enrolled into training'' is when the worker has been accepted to an approved training program
that will begin within 30 calendar days. Both recommended that the definition provide that a worker be considered
as enrolled in training upon acceptance into an approved training program and scheduled to commence training on the
next regularly scheduled program starting date. Rural States have a limited number of training facilities offering
open entry and open exit options. Virtually all training programs offered by both public and private facilities have
designated enrollment dates. The 30-day limitation would cause States to invoke the waiver provision unnecessarily.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department included the 30-day provision in the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' to help reduce the number
of waivers of the training requirement that would have to be issued by State administering agencies because approved
training would not begin immediately. The Department recognizes that schedules for some training institutions
may involve periods longer than 30 days for training to begin. In such situations, a waiver may and should be granted.
States must search for training programs for individuals which will begin within 30 days, or as soon as possible thereafter.
To allow fewer days in the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' would generate more waivers of the training requirement
and increase administrative costs. The Department believes that extending this period in regulations would be difficult
to justify. Under the statute, the objective of the training requirement is to get workers actively engaged in training
as soon as possible, as a condition of entitlement to TRA. The 30-day requirement eliminates the need for a waiver where
the training program is to begin within 30 days, but does not subject the worker to the EB work test while awaiting the
start of training. Accordingly, no change is made in the final regulations.

 The MDLIR commented that &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vi)(B) and (vii)(B) and (C), which refer to the EB work test and the training
requirement, appear to be contradictory. The regulations state that the EB work test and the training requirement
shall not apply to an individual with respect to a claim for TRA for weeks of unemployment prior to the filing of an initial
claim for TRA, nor for any week which begins before the certification is issued and the individual is fully informed
of the requirement. The MDLIR points out that the language of these paragraphs appears to permit retroactive payments
of TRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not agree with the commenter. The cited paragraphs of the regulations do not authorize retroactive
payments of TRA. These paragraphs specifically provide that the requirements for eligibility in clauses (vi) and
(vii) may not be applied retroactively, to workers otherwise eligible for basic TRA, because workers cannot comply
retroactively with those requirements. This is a ``due process'' issue only. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), stated that the requirement ``the training occurred subsequent to the individual's total or partial separation''
goes beyond Congressional intent. The UCSP argues that in amended Section 231(a)(5)(B) Congress allowed TRA payments
to workers who have ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;after the date on which the worker became totally separated, or partially
separated, from adversely affected employment, completed a training program approved by the Secretary.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), recommended that the definition for ``enrolled in training'' be amended by adding after ``within 30 calendar days''
the words ``or the next available time the training could begin at the training institution.'' The WESD explained
that in the cases where training is not available within 30 days of approval that to subject the worker to the EB work
test, which means a worker must accept any work the worker is physically capable of performing, would be to the detriment
of the worker when training is approved and planned for in the foreseeable future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the period the EB work test is applied under &sect;617.19(b)(3), when the training requirement is waived,
the worker may find suitable employment which would eliminate the need for additional training. If the State agency
determines the job is not suitable (as defined in &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii)), and it is reasonable and necessary for
the worker to quit work in order to enter training, as provided in &sect;617.18(b)(1)(iii), the individual may enter
training when the training program begins. Also, see the Department's response in item 20, above. Therefore, no change
is made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certain waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PDLI commented that &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(C) appears to require that a worker must meet all the requirements
applicable to eligibility for basic TRA in the preceding sections, including the wage and employment qualifying
requirements, with respect to the total separation in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(B), to qualify for the waiver of the
basic TRA eligibility period and the 210-day filing requirement under Section 1425(b) of the OTCA. The PDLI commented
further that the reference in Section 1425(b) is to total separations from adversely affected employment within
the meaning of Section 247 of the Act. Section 247 defines both separation and adversely affected employment. The
definitions do not include references to wage and employment qualifying requirements. Requiring workers to meet
these additional conditions with respect to the total separation noted in section 1425(b) seems to be beyond the intent
of the law. Further, to the extent previous Federal operating instructions (GAL 7&hyph;88) direct the wage requirements,
including equivalent qualifying weeks, be met as provided under the law prior to the 1986 Amendments, the PDLI believes
those instructions are incorrect and should be revised.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not concur in these comments. Section 1425(b) does not remove the wage and employment qualifying
requirements of the Trade Act. This section, by specific reference to sections 233(a)(2) and 233(b), only eliminates
the time limit on the eligibility period for receiving basic TRA and the 210-day time limit for filing for training
to qualify for additional weeks of TRA. No waiver of any of the other basic eligibility requirements is implied in removing
these two time constraints. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.

The WESD, commenting on &sect;617.15(b)(2), argues that it would be a contradiction for the Department to retain
the present 210-day requirement for requesting training in order to qualify for additional weeks of TRA rather than
applying a movable eligibility period as used for TRA payments. The NJDL and the MESC also commented that the 210-day
period should begin with the individual's most recent qualifying separation.

The Department agrees with these comments, and &sect;617.15(b) is revised accordingly in the final rule. This change
has already been implemented through Change 2 to GAL 7&hyph;88 and reiterated in GAL 15&hyph;90, both of which were
also previously published as notices in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This change is effective for decisions made on or after August 23, 1988, when the movable eligibility period took

Scheduled breaks in training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UAW, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(1), pointed out that amended section 233(f) provides that a worker shall
be treated as participating in training during a week which falls in a break of 14 days or less, if the worker was participating
in training before the break and ``the break is provided under such training program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UAW points out that the proposed rule adds the requirement that the break be ``provided in the published schedule
of the training program.'' While ``publication'' might ease administration, there are some individualized training
programs which do not have published schedules. Therefore, the UAW recommended that ``previously established''
schedule as an alternative formulation which would permit workers in less academic settings to continue to receive
TRA as Congress intended, but prevent nonparticipating workers from arguing they were merely ``on break.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe such a narrow reading need be given to the word ``published,'' but has clarified the
regulations by modifying &sect;617.15(d)(1) to add after the ``published schedule'' the words ``or previously
established schedule'' and by adding that the break may be indicated in the training program approved for the individual.
The intent is to ensure that ``breaks'' in training during which TRA payments may continue are not limited to regularly
scheduled breaks established by the training provider before the program begins but also include all other periods
of time elapsing between courses or phases of the approved training program. Therefore, the changes made in this final
rule with respect to this matter go beyond the comments received, and, as explained in item F. above, a new clause (2)
is added to &sect;617.15(d) to define a scheduled break in training as including scheduled breaks within or between
courses, terms, quarters, semesters, and academic years, whether or not such breaks are scheduled by the training
provider.

&sect;617.15(d)(1)(i) requires, in addition to other requirements, that the worker be participating in training
immediately prior to the break and resume participation immediately after the break ends. The PDLI recommends that
this provision might be stated better by changing the final regulation to participating in training for the week claimed
prior to the beginning of the break and resuming participation for the week claimed at the end of the break.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes the commenter's suggestion would introduce some ambiguity in the wording of the regulations.
However, &sect;617.15(d)(1) is revised to reflect the change announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, and set forth in Section
E.3., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payments of TRA During Breaks in Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90. Section 233(f) provides for the payment of basic and additional TRA ``during any
week which is part of a break in training'' provided certain conditions are met. The conditions are spelled out in &sect;617.15(d)(1),
clauses (i) through (iii). In addition, as a condition of TRA eligibility during the break, &sect;617.15(d)(1) is
amended to restate the requirement that the worker shall be required to participate in training after the break ends.
This will assure that the purpose of Section 233(f) is carried out. Section 617.15(d)(1) accordingly is modified
by removing the ``resume participation'' condition from clause (i) and restating it in clause (iii), with emphasis
upon ``immediate'' resumption of participation.

The ODHR, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i), explains that by including the phrase ``and resumes participation''
as a condition for payment means that no payment for the break can be paid until the break is over and this is verified.
The ODHR states that this contradicts the intent of the rule that ``An individual will continue to receive basic and
additional weeks of TRA during scheduled breaks in training'' and would create problems if the break fell within the
individual's scheduled reporting period. The NYDL provided similar comments on &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i).

The Department agrees that it is not the intent of this regulation to delay TRA payments during scheduled breaks in
training that do not exceed 14 days. However, if a worker fails to resume participation in the training immediately
after the break ends, any payments made during the scheduled break shall be established as overpayments, subject
to repayment under the provisions of &sect;617.55. Therefore, no change in the regulations is necessary to reflect
this intent.

The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(2), stated that no basic TRA may be paid if the individual is on a scheduled
training break of 15 days or more. The MESC stated that denial of TRA to a claimant during a break which exceeds 14 days,
but less than 30 days, is inconsistent with the definition of ``enrolled in training'' in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which allows payment of TRA to a claimant who will enter training within 30 days. A claimant during a break in training
of less than 30 days should be considered enrolled in training and eligible for basic TRA.

The purpose of these two provisions is not similar, nor is there a basis in the statute for altering the specific 14-day
provision of section 233(f). The 14-day break in training provision is a statutory requirement and not subject to
change in regulations. On the 30-day provision, see the discussion in item 20 above. Therefore, no change is made in
the final regulations.

The Department agrees that recognized legal holidays should not be counted, and has already acknowledged this change
in section E.3. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 (also see page 3 of the GAL). Ordinarily, breaks in training are oriented
to National and State holidays, and to periods within terms or semesters of the training institution. The one long
holiday oriented break each year is the holiday beginning around the second or third week in December and ending after
New Year's Day. Since these holidays are the reason for the break, the Department agrees that such holidays should
not be included in counting the number of days of the break. The critical point is whether a particular day would ordinarily
be a scheduled training day in the particular training program. Therefore, official State and National holidays
are added to the days not counted in counting the days of a break, if training in the program concerned would not normally
be scheduled on such days. (See the explanation in item F. above.)

EB work test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.17(b)(2), stated that this section indicates that on or after November 21, 1988,
claimants in training which is State approved (but not TAA approved) must satisfy the EB work test. The MESC further
states that before November 21, 1988, the EB work test was not applied to claimants in State approved training. The
MESC argues that there should be no change in the exception to the EB work test on or after November 21, 1988. Section
231(a)(4) of the Trade Act, unchanged by the 1988 Amendments, requires that to be eligible for TRA, a worker would not
be disqualified for EB due to the work test. An EB claimant in State approved training would not be disqualified.

Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter incorrectly reads section 231(a)(4) and the effect of the substantive amendment to section 231(a)(5),
which was effective on November 21, 1988. Prior to November 21, 1988, for the purposes of basic TRA, participation
in training approved under the State law or under &sect;617.22(a) was sufficient to make the able and available requirement,
including the EB work test, inapplicable. The amendment to section 231(a)(5) makes training approved under section
236 an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, effective on November 21, 1988. After November 20, therefore, claimants
for basic TRA may not satisfy the requirement of section 231(a)(5), or avoid the EB work test, by participating in training
which is not approved under section 236. The Department's position was clearly set forth in section 4.C. of GAL 7&hyph;88,
and was reiterated without change in section C. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90; it also is correctly stated in &sect;&sect;617.11(a)
(2), (3), and (4) and 617.17(b) of the proposed rule and is retained in this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To give full effect to the 1988 Amendments, moreover, the EB work test must apply even after the TRA claimant has satisfied
the requirement of Section 231(a)(5) by completing a training program approved under amended &sect;617.22(a),
(see Section C. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90). Having completed such training, the individual should be job ready,
and should be actively seeking work so as to return to employment as soon as possible. It is particularly appropriate
in these circumstances, therefore, that the EB work test of section 231(a)(4) should apply in regard to any further
claims for basic TRA. It would not accord with these purposes to permit the claimant to avoid the EB work test by engaging
in any other training that is not approved under amended &sect;617.22(a). The Department has concluded, and the final
regulations provide, therefore, that the EB work test must be met by every claimant for basic TRA, unless the claimant
actually is enrolled in or participating in TAA approved training as specified in the Trade Act and in these final regulations.
This requirement applies as well to claimants who have completed TAA approved training, with respect to any claim
for basic TRA for any week beginning after completing the training program. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), commented on &sect;617.18(b)(2)(i),
regarding an individual who ``*&blank;*&blank;* fails to make satisfactory progress in training,'' and on &sect;617.18(b)(2)(ii)(C),

Justifiable cause,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 including reasons related to the individual's capability to participate in or complete approved training. The AFL-CIO
recommends that, since educational limitations are a common reason for failure to profit from job training, such
individuals should be promptly evaluated as to the need for remedial education, as authorized under the 1988 Amendments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that training must be suitable for the worker. The fifth criterion in section 236(a)(1) requires
a supported determination that a worker is qualified to undertake and complete the training being approved. See section
G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 and section 4.G.1. of GAL 7&hyph;88, and &sect;617.22(a)(5). This provision
emphasizes the worker's personal qualifications; that is, that the worker's own physical and mental capabilities
and background and experience are appropriate to the training. It states further that the worker must be evaluated
before approving training as being qualified to undertake the specific training program being considered and to
complete that training program successfully. If the worker needs remedial education, this should be identified
and included as a part of the approved training program. If, during the training program, the need for remedial education
becomes apparent, appropriate arrangements should be made to accommodate those needs as part of the same training
program. Therefore, while the Department agrees with the comment, no change is needed in the regulations to accomplish
this intent. However, the worker's personal qualifications in &sect;617.22(a)(5) are amended by adding financial
resources to the existing qualifications to undertake and complete the training being approved. Item J., above,
explains the change and the Department's reasons for the change.

Satisfactory progress in training.

The PDLI commented that several paragraphs in the proposed rule refer to ``making satisfactory progress'' in training.
This language was amended in section 233(a) of the Trade Act effec- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tive on November 21, 1988, to ``participating'' in training, and section 236(c) was repealed. The PDLI recommends
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless these sections refer to the law prior to November 21, 1988, this language only serves to confuse and should be
revised or deleted. The UCSP and UAW made similar comments on the requirement in the proposed rule that the worker must
have ``successfully'' completed an approved training program to meet the training completion requirement of amended
Section 231(a)(5).

Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has reconsidered these matters and agrees that the comments on ``satisfactory progress'' have merit.
References to ``satisfactory progress'' have therefore been removed from &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(D), 617.15(b)(3),
617.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), and 617.18(b)(2)(i). The references to ``successfully'' completed and ``satisfactory''
completion of training are also removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii) (A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, the conditions for ``completed training'' in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are retained. To meet the requirements of section 231(a)(5) of the Act, it is reasonable to expect an individual who
completed a training program to have satisfied the standards or conditions for the training program and, therefore,
to have ``successfully'' completed such training in order to be job ready. Further, in connection with making this
correction in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(D), the language is modified to make it clearer that an individual must actually
be enrolled in or participating in approved training in each week that TRA is claimed, and that, while the break in training
provisions of &sect;617.15(d) apply, the waiver of participation provisions of &sect;617.19 shall not be applicable
under paragraph (a)(3).

Waiver appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PDLI commented that &sect;617.19(a)(2) provides the minimum information that shall be contained on the waiver
of training participation. (&sect;617.19(c)(3) provides for equivalent information on the waiver revocation
form.) These minimum information items do not include an appeal date, or instructions for appeal. However, &sect;617.19(c)(4)
appears to state that waivers and waiver revocations shall be appealable. The PDLI suggests that the issuance of waivers
and waiver revocations should not be appealable determinations; rather, these documents are prerequisites to determinations
of entitlement to TRA payments, and these latter determinations should be appealable. The PDLI recommends further
evaluation of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1975 regulations required that all determinations relating to TAA program benefits shall be subject to appeal
and review, as specifically required by section 239(d) of the Trade Act of 1974. That requirement continues in effect
and is correctly implemented in the regulations in providing that &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 shall apply to all
determinations regarding waivers, as well as any determination pertaining to any other TAA program benefit. Waivers
have a direct relationship to basic TRA entitlement. The Department does not believe it would be appropriate to provide
that an individual should be denied the right to appeal a determination issued by the State agency that training is
not feasible or appropriate, or that written notice of such determinations (granting, denying, or revoking a waiver)
should not include notice of appeal rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration of the comments, however, reveals that there appears to be some lingering uncertainty about the scope
of the waiver provision and the appeal rights of individual workers, and the reexamination of the language proposed
for &sect;617.19 underscores the need for some clarification of the regulatory language so as to express the scope
of the waiver provision more accurately and to declare unmistakably the appeal and review rights of individuals in
regard to all determinations relating to waivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;617.19 thus is revised to state more accurately the scope of the waiver provision, and to
state explicitly that a waiver pertains solely to basic TRA and may never be made applicable to additional TRA. Paragraph
(a)(2) is revised so as to be more explicit about the application of the waiver provision, and to provide that waiver
determinations shall include all of the information required by &sect;617.50(e), which thereby requires inclusion
of notice of appeal rights in any such determination. This is in addition to other information specified in paragraph
(a)(2) that is required to be furnished in the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other important changes in paragraph (a) of &sect;617.19 are the addition of clauses (3) and (4). Clause (3) is added
to make certain that denial of a waiver also is a determination to which all of the requirements for determinations
apply. Clause (4) is a restatement of the provision proposed in paragraph (c)(4), and is moved in paragraph (a) and
revised to make more explicit the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 to all determinations under paragraph (a) and to provide expressly that this means
and includes notice of appeal rights.

Waiver revocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NYDL commented on &sect;617.19(a)(2)(iv), which mandates inclusion of the statement that the ``waiver will
be revoked at any time suitable training becomes available.'' This statement would be appropriate only for waivers
issued because suitable training is not currently available; however, there are numerous situations in which training
may become available and yet a revocation of waiver would not be appropriate. Accordingly, the NYDL recommended the
following statement as more appropriate: ``This waiver is subject to review at 30 day intervals.'' This would afford
the states the needed latitude to assess the continuing validity of a waiver should training become available but
remain inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that the qualifying wording is too narrowly focused, but does not agree on affording States
the broad latitude suggested by the NYDL. Accordingly, &sect;617.19(a)(2)(iv) is revised by deleting the term ``suitable
training'' and inserting in place thereof ``appropriate and feasible training'' as provided in amended section
231(c)(2) of the Act.

 The UAW commented that &sect;617.19(b)(2)(i) as drafted should be of substantial assistance to State agencies in
administering this provision. The UAW suggested that, for clarity, the Department repeat the criteria that ``the
worker is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training'' at this point in the rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that &sect;617.19(b)(2) adequately covers the reasons for issuing a waiver when training
is not feasible or appropriate. The UAW's point is covered under the criteria for approval of training. Therefore,
no change is made in the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nebraska Department of Labor (NDL) commented that &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) indicates that a course of training
is not appropriate if the duration of training exceeds the individual's maximum entitlement to TRA payments. This
would seem to limit appropriate training to a duration of 52 weeks when initial UI eligibility is 26 weeks. If this is
the actual effect, it ignores the fact that an individual may enter training during the initial UI benefit period.
When the individual enters training during the UI eligibility period, a training program of up to 78 weeks might be
completed before exhausting TRA benefits. It seems further to preclude the possibility for an individual who enters
training during the first 13 weeks of UI to be eligible for needs based payments under EDWAA during the portion of a training
period which might extend beyond the end of TRA eligibility. If this section in fact has these effects, they may be unintended,
and should perhaps be reconsidered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The TAA provisions of the Trade Act authorize the State to approve training for a worker for up to 104 weeks; however,
the maximum combined duration of UI and TRA payments generally is 78 weeks. If a training program longer than the worker's
remaining eligibility for UI and TRA payments is being considered, the State administering agency should ensure
that the individual has the financial resources to complete the training program after TRA payments expire. If such
an assurance cannot be made, a training program of shorter duration should be considered for approval. The Department
therefore agrees that the regulation is too strictly worded, and &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) is clarified in these
final regulations. (See discussion in item J. above, on Revision of &sect;617.22(a)(5).)

Reasons for waiver.

 The VDET, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(C), concerning reasons for issuing a waiver, asked why, after 26 weeks of UI, a person with
skills for suitable employment has not become reemployed already. Simply allowing a waiver to be granted at this point
in a person's unemployment seems to be at odds with the intent of all of the recently enacted Federal retraining legislation,
and may actually exacerbate a situation where the worker has not been receiving the proper services which would result
in new employment. The VDET recognized that there may be some circumstances where it would be unfair to the worker not
to receive a waiver based on this condition. However, the VDET recommended making this condition an extreme one, by
not specifically identifying it as a reason to grant a waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that waivers should only be issued on a limited basis. As reflected in the VDET comment, however,
there may be situations where such waivers are properly warranted. For example, when a firm agrees to employ a worker
in the foreseeable future, no purpose would be served by having the worker enter training to learn other occupational
skills. Therefore, the Department sees no need to make any change in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.19(c)(1) be deleted as an unnecessary guideline with which compliance could be impossible. The OBES presented
similar comments that the final rule should reflect administrative and logistical realities by specifying such
period for waiver review to be 60 days. Basic TRA payments should be made once a waiver has been issued until such time
as the waiver is revoked, and not require documentation of such waiver reviews on an ongoing or routine basis. The CEDD
also recommended that the frequency of waiver reviews be changed to 60 days. The MESC recommended that waivers be reviewed
every 90 days, while the ODHR recommended that the State have more flexibility in the frequency for reviewing waivers.
The NJDL recommended that States be given authority to establish procedures for reviewing appropriate waivers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A major objective of the 1988 Amendments is to enroll adversely affected workers in training programs to help facilitate
their return to employment as quickly as possible. The Department believes that, when the training requirement is
waived for an individual, proper program administration necessitates regular reviews of waivers issued by the State
agencies. The frequency of such reviews at 30-day intervals is reasonable to carry out the provision requiring adversely
affected workers to be enrolled in training for purposes of receiving TRA, particularly in light of the fact that TRA
is a weekly benefit program and the 30-day rule only requires review approximately every four weeks. Section 231(c)(2)(B)
provides that ``If, after submitting to a worker a written statement *&blank;*&blank;* a State or State agency finds
that it is feasible or appropriate to approve a training program for such worker pursuant to the requirements of section
236(a), the State or State agency shall submit to such worker *&blank;*&blank;* a written statement that revokes
the certification *&blank;*&blank;*.'' To review waivers less frequently than every 30 days would not give the sense
of urgency reflected in the law on placing adversely affected workers into training programs as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the comments highlight an omission in the regulations, in that, in individual cases, when circumstances
change, the need to revoke a waiver may arise earlier than the next periodic review, and, accordingly, necessitate
action to revoke the certification before the next review date. Therefore, &sect;617.19(c)(2) is amended to require
revocation in individual cases at any time a change in circumstances occurs.

Waiver determinations appealable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.19(c)(4), stated that waiver actions should not be appealable determinations.
If training is being denied, the denial and any appeal should come on the training determination, not on the waiver.
Otherwise, duplicative appeals and confusion of issues will result. The waiver form should contain an explanatory
statement, such as: ``If you disagree with this waiver action, you have the right to appeal any denial of training or
trade readjustment allowances (TRA) that results from this action.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 See discussion under item 34, above. A determination on the feasibility and appropriateness of training, and the
reason(s) therefor, constitutes the critical determination on whether a worker is subject to the EB work test regarding
claims for basic TRA. Equally important is the relevance of a waiver in some cases. For example, a waiver is not appropriate
concerning entitlement to additional TRA, because additional TRA is payable only while the worker is actually participating
in training, and, in that case, the EB work test is not applicable. Similarly, a waiver is not appropriate during breaks
in training. It is not needed if the break is not more than 14 days. A waiver is not appropriate if the break is more than
14 days, since payment of basic or additional TRA in this case would be inconsistent with sections 231(a)(5), 233(a)(3),
and 233(f). It is clear, therefore, that the determination resulting in the issuance, denial or revocation of a waiver
presents justiciable issues, and, accordingly, determinations relating to waivers must be subject to the right
of appeal and review. To deny the right of appeal and review on justiciable issues cannot be justified. Paragraph (c)(4)
of &sect;617.19, therefore, has a sound basis in law, and is unchanged in the final rule.

(1) track the language of section 231(c)(3) of the Trade Act, which provides that the Secretary shall submit an annual
report to Congress on the number of waivers issued and the number revoked. As explained in item 14 above, matters concerning
the administrative funding for all TAA activities are addressed in program letters and other issuances of the Department
and will be addressed further in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.60 when it is published. No special funding category is contemplated for this item. Therefore, no change
is made in the final regulations.

Reemployment plans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NYDL commented that to require monthly reviews of individual reemployment plans, as implied in &sect;617.20(b)(13),
would not serve the worker in a constructive way, and to interview every adversely affected worker needlessly would
place an unreasonable burden on the agency when there is a minimum amount of funds available for staff costs. The PDLI
and the NJDL provided similar comments.

Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department concurs in the comments. It is not the Department's intent to have State agency staffs review individual
reemployment plans every 30 days, as is required for waivers of the training requirement. Therefore, the rule is modified
to provide for periodic review and updating of reemployment plans, as may be appropriate, in individual cases. The
review of waivers, which is required no less frequently than every 30 days under &sect;617.19(c)(1), is addressed
in a new clause (14) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.20(b).

Work in the ``foreseeable future''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The UAW, commenting on &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii), stated the proposed rule provides that training can be denied if
there is a reasonable prospect of suitable work within the ``foreseeable future.'' The statute does not include this
element, providing instead that there must be ``no suitable employment available'' to the adversely affected worker.
The UAW argues that under the proposed rule, a worker could be denied TRA because training was not approved due to foreseeable
work, even though the worker had no job to enter. The UCSP provided similar comments and recommended that the last part
of the rule be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This provision was incorporated in the regulations to preclude the approval of training when the worker is clearly
scheduled to be employed or recalled. For that worker, suitable employment is ``available'' if the employment may
occur in the foreseeable future. The purpose of including the provision in the rule is to give meaning to the first criterion
of section 236(a)(1) and help preserve limited training funds for use by workers who need such assistance to return
to employment. Labor-management agreements frequently provide for worker recall on a seniority basis. When recalls
are scheduled in the foreseeable future, workers clearly do not need training in order to return to employment. In
such situations, a waiver of the training requirement is appropriate and shall be issued by the State administering
agency. Therefore, no change is made in &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii) of the regulations. However, as explained in item
H. above, guidance is added in &sect;&sect;617.19 (b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) for use by State agencies on the
application of recall that will occur in the ``reasonably foreseeable future.''

Suitable employment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The AFL-CIO, commenting on &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii), pointed out that the term ``suitable employment'' means work
at no less than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage in such adversely affected employment. Since job benefits
such as health insurance and pension entitlement must be coupled with wages to determine the total compensation of
a position, this definition should be expanded to include ``and benefits valued at not less than 80 percent of those
provided in the worker's adversely affected employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The regulation uses the definition in section 236(e), and any change such as that suggested would require a change
in the law. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adversely affected wage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The MDLIR, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii), explained that suitable employment is defined in the proposed rule as work of a substantially
equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment and wages for such work at not less
than 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage in such adversely affected employment. The MDLIR asks why, since
there does not appear to be a change in the law, the regulation was changed from average weekly wage to average weekly
wage in adversely affected employment? In addition, the definition of average weekly wage in adversely affected
employment makes reference to partial separation which, for separations on August 23, 1988 or later, will no longer
establish TRA eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department agrees that the definition of ``average weekly wage in adversely affected employment'' is used appropriately
only in the definition of ``partial separation,'' and the definition of ``suitable work'' in section 236(e) does
not include the reference to adversely affected employment. Therefore, to fully accord with the statute, the phrase
``in such adversely affected employment'' is removed from &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii).

Training cost limit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The UAW, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.22(b), pointed out that the Conference Committee rejected a proposed $4000 per worker limit on training
costs, stating that ``it is inappropriate to establish a ceiling on training and related costs for individual workers
since such costs may vary significantly from one region of the country to another and from one worker dislocation to
another.'' The Department cannot give the States the authority to do indirectly what the Congress decided it would
not let the Department do directly. The UAW recommended that this proposal should be dropped. The UCSP provided similar
comments. The MESC also commented that it is contradictory to require States to establish a single maximum amount
and then indicate that States should take into consideration the type of occupational training, duration of training,
etc. The different types of training and varying durations render a single maximum cost meaningless. By applying
&sect;617.22(a)(6)(iv)(B), there will be sufficient cost control. Section 617.22(a)(6)(iv)(B) requires comparison
of training similar in quality, content and results at different training facilities, and approval of the lowest
cost training. Also, the ODHR recommended that more guidelines are needed in order to define the ``maximum amount
allowable for the total costs of training.'' Specifically, ODHR is concerned with overcoming inequities in setting
an amount both for individuals in a rural area without training facilities and for individuals in an urban area with
training facilities. The ODHR asked if it is the intent for the maximum amount allowable, because the cost of subsistence
or mileage is part of the cost of training, to limit the kinds or duration of training for individuals in rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department agrees with the comments and is amending this section by eliminating the requirement that States
establish, annually, a maximum amount allowable for the total cost of training for each worker. While the Congress
did not establish a national ceiling for the costs of training for individual workers, the Conferees did state in the
Conference Report that they expected the Secretary of Labor to set forth guidelines for State administering agencies
to provide approved training at the lowest reasonable cost for the particular type of training in that region consistent
with the objective of assisting import impacted workers to obtain suitable skills to return to work as quickly as possible.
The 1988 Amendments clearly provide that State administering agencies shall approve training for individual workers
at the lowest reasonable cost which will lead to employment and will result in training opportunities for the largest
number of adversely affected workers. This means that State administering agencies should avoid approving training
for occupations that require an extraordinarily high skill level relative to the worker's current skills level and
for which total costs of training, including transportation and subsistence, are excessively high. While the final
regulations eliminate the requirement for States to establish a maximum amount allowable for the total costs of training,
they continue to provide that States approve training at the lowest reasonable cost for the particular type of training
in that region that will lead to employment and will enable the worker to obtain employment within a reasonable period
of time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Child care
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The WESD, commenting on &sect;617.22, stated it believed that child care is equally important as transportation
and subsistence to include as a cost of training. The WESD recommended that child care be included under the definition
for supportive services, as is transportation and subsistence. The WESD states that the 1981 Amendments do not permit
self-financed training and require TAA or other Federal, State, or private sources to ``pay the full costs of the training.''
Washington contends that the lack of child care would, in fact, require self payment of training costs and it should
be included as part of the reasonable costs of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 236(b) authorizes transportation and subsistence expenses applicable to training. Child care is a supportive
service to be obtained for individuals under section 235 of the Act (and &sect;617.21(e)), and is not a training cost
in the TAA program. Funds for the administration of sections 225, 231 through 235, 243 and 244 of the Trade Act are appropriated
in the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations (SUIESO) account. The SUIESO account includes
funds for the administration of section 235 activities but not for the direct payment of supportive services for certified
individuals. Since child care is a supportive service authorized by section 235 to be provided if available under
``any other Federal law'', no TAA funds are appropriated for such services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's position is that the State administering agency, in carrying out its responsibilities under section
235 and &sect;617.21(e), should make every reasonable effort to secure for adversely affected workers covered by
a certification any supportive services, including child care, which are obtainable under any other Federal law,
to help individuals in training and to obtain employment. No change is made in the regulations, but &sect;617.21 is
amended to make clear that supportive services are to be provided under other Federal law and may include child care.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MESC, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.24(e), stated that this rule allows approval of training for which all, or any portion, of the cost of training
is paid ``from any other source''. The MESC points out that the rule does not sufficiently define acceptable funding
sources. Some limits are necessary. Acceptable funding sources should be limited to recognized employment and training
programs, including employer training funds. Such funding sources as friends, relatives, and fraternal organizations
should not be acceptable, but &sect;617.24(e) does not preclude them.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department concurs in this comment and has modified &sect;&sect;617.24(e)(2) and 617.25(b)(1) to clarify that
other funding sources may not include sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends. This
is consistent with the Department's prior position on this matter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equal monthly installments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MESC questioned the application of the requirement in &sect;617.25(a) that employers be paid in equal monthly
installments for on-the-job training (OJT) programs. The MESC stated that problems are associated with trainees
entering OJT programs in the middle of the month, trainees receiving raises in wages during the month, and trainees
working different hours. The MESC explained that it has attempted to satisfy the intent of the equal monthly payment
requirement by having the employer bill for the trainee's hours in training during the month, which results in approximately
equal monthly payments. The Governor of Idaho and the WESD presented similar comments on &sect;617.25. The Governor
stated that the proposed rule will require Idaho and possibly many other States to incur additional administrative
costs to pay for tracking OJT reimbursements. The WESD suggested that reimbursement to employers for actual hours
worked by the trainee, on a monthly basis, would eliminate overpayments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that the statutory provision requiring payments for OJT to be made to employers in equal
monthly installments is presenting problems in negotiating and reimbursing employers for OJT contracts. In negotiating
OJT contracts with employers, reasonable costs should be based on the achievement of a prescribed level of job skills,
rather than being based solely on the hourly wages of the worker. The hourly wages should serve only as a guide for establishing
OJT contract costs. A raise in the worker's wages implies increased proficiency of the worker and higher productivity,
and may not form the basis for increasing training costs. Once the cost of OJT for a worker is established, payments
can be made in equal monthly installments, with any required adjustment made in the final payment to the employer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What appears to be troubling to States in administering this provision is thinking of equal monthly installments
in terms of equal ``dollar'' amounts. Instead, it appears most reasonable to base the ``equal monthly installments''
on the number of hours of paid work during the month, multiplied by the agreed upon rate of payment. Although this would
not assure the same dollar figure for each month, it is nonetheless ``equal'' in the sense that the payment for each
month is computed at the same rate. This method would appear to ad-dress the concerns expressed in the comments received,
and may be accomplished under the present reading of &sect;617.25(a). For these reasons, no change is made in the regulations.

Pell and similar grants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ODHR, commenting on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.25(b)(4)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), stated the rule is clear that when the direct payment of the costs of training has been made under any other Federal
law, or the costs are reimbursable under any other Federal law and a portion of the direct costs has already been paid
under such other Federal law, payment of such training costs may not be made from TAA funds. The ODHR points out, however,
that grants, such as Pell Grants, are often paid directly to the institution to be applied toward tuition. The ODHR
feels this contingency should be addressed here and that these funds should be allowed in these cases in determining
costs payable from TAA funds for training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that complications are presented in considering appropriate TAA funding in the case of Pell
Grants and similar Federal educational assistance. Section 617.25(b)(4)(ii)(C) provides, in implementing section
236(a)(4)(C), that such federal educational assistance paid to the individual may not be taken into account in determining
payment of the costs of training from TAA or other funds, but such payments to the individual shall be deducted from
TRA under &sect;617.13(c)(2). Conversely, when such Federal educational assistance is paid to the training institution,
to the extent it is used for training costs otherwise payable from TAA funds, it must be taken into account in determining
the training costs payable from TAA funds, either alone or in combination with other funds. To clarify this matter,
the regulations at &sect;617.25(b)(4)(ii)(C) are modified; combination funding is otherwise addressed in more
detail in the completely revised &sect;617.25.

OJT approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AFL&hyph;CIO recommended that additional standards be added in &sect;617.25(a) concerning the approval of
on-the-job training agreements. Further, the AFL&hyph;CIO recommended that since employers available to provide
OJT under TAA have offered such training under JTPA, those who failed to meet JTPA requirements should be barred from
receiving TAA funds for such training. Such a requirement is clearly in keeping with the emphasis on coordination
of TAA program activities with the JTPA Title III program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements in &sect;617.25(a) are based on existing statutory language, and provide adequate protection
to workers from adverse effects under OJT training contracts. The Department agrees that contracts under the TAA
program for OJT should not be entered into with employers who failed to meet JTPA requirements. While &sect;617.25
(a)(9) and (a)(10) are intended to avoid such situations, the final rule is clarified to help ensure that employers
who violated a JTPA training contract will be denied TAA training contracts. The words ``or under any other Federal
law'' is added after ``this Subpart C'' in paragraph (a)(9) of &sect;617.25, with another addition at the end of paragraph
(a)(9) to make this point clear.

and announced it will shortly lift the re-straints on homework in the women's and children's apparel industry. While
this matter is not finally resolved due to court challenges, the TAA regulations have to anticipate the situation
of potentially extensive homework in these industries.

for the worker (including whether there is a reasonable prospect which is reasonably foreseeable that the individual
will be reemployed by the firm from which separated), and compatibility of the training for the purposes of the TAA
Program. In these respects, suitability of training for the individual is encompassed within the several criteria
in &sect;617.22 (a), and compatibility with the program is covered by the various provisions of subpart C of this part
which describe the types of training approvable under &sect;617.22(a) and the limitations thereon.

Whether training is feasible or appropriate at any given time is determined by finding whether, at that time, training
suitable for the worker is available, the training is approvable under subpart C of this part including the criteria
in &sect;617.22(a), the worker is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training and satisfactorily
complete the training, full funding for the training is available from one or more sources in accordance with &sect;&sect;617.24
and 617.25, the worker has the financial resources to complete the training when the duration of the training program
exceeds the worker's eligibility for TRA, and the training will commence within 30 days of approval.

Planned recall. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of determining whether the recall or reemployment of an individual is reasonably foreseeable (for
the purposes of this section and &sect;617.22), either a specific or general type of recall (as set out) shall be deemed
to be sufficient.

Specific recall. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A specific recall is where an individual or group of individuals who was separated from employment is identified and
notified by the employer to return to work within a specified time period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General recall. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A general recall is where the employer announces an intention to recall an individual or group of individuals, or by
other action reasonably signals an intent to recall, without specifying any certain date or specific time period.

Reasonably foreseeable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of determining whether training should be denied and a training waiver granted, because of a planned
recall that is reasonably foreseeable, such a planned recall includes a specific recall and also includes a general
recall (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section) if the general recall in each individual's case is reasonably expected to occur before the individual
exhausts eligibility for any regular UI payments for which the individual is or may become entitled. A general recall,
in which the timing of the recall is reasonably expected to occur after the individual's exhaustion of any regular
UI to which the individual is or may become entitled, shall not be treated as precluding approval of training, but shall
be treated as any other worker separation for these purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The duration of training suitable for the individual exceeds the individual's maximum entitlement to basic and
additional TRA payments and the individual cannot assure financial responsibility for completing the training
program,

An individual who has been furnished a written notice of waiver under paragraph (a)(2) of this section (or denial of
waiver under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) shall be subject to all of the requirements of &sect;617.17(a), which
shall continue until the individual is enrolled in a training program as required by paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of &sect;617.11.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver review and revocations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) State agencies must have a procedure for reviewing regularly (i.e., every 30 days or less) all waivers issued under
this section to individuals, to ascertain that the conditions upon which the waivers were granted continue to exist.
In any case in which the conditions have changed_i.e., training has become feasible and appropriate_then the waiver
must be revoked, and a written notice of revocation shall be furnished to the individual involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the periodic reviews required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, State agencies must have a procedure
for revoking waivers in individual cases promptly whenever a change in circumstances occurs. For example, a written
notice of revocation shall be issued to the individual concurrent with the approval of the training in which the individual
has enrolled (if such training is scheduled to commence within 30 days), and shall not be issued prior to such approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State agencies may incorporate a revocation section in the waiver form or on a separate revocation form. Any determination
under paragraph (c) of this section shall be a determination to which &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 apply. The information
included in a written notice of revocation issued under this paragraph (c) shall include all of the information required
for written notices issued under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) State agencies must develop procedures for compiling and reporting on the number of waivers issued and revoked,
by reason, as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and report such data to the Department of Labor as
requested by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State agencies are not required to forward copies of individual waiver and revocation notices to the Department
of Labor, unless specifically requested by the Department. However, each State agency shall retain a copy of every
individual waiver and revocation notice issued by the State, for such period of time as the Department requires. (Approved
by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1205&hyph;0016).

 This training activity is any training of the type normally conducted in a classroom setting, including vocational
education, and may be provided to individuals when the conditions for approval of training are met, as provided in
&sect;617.22(a), to impart technical skills and information required to perform a specific job or group of jobs.
Training designed to enhance the employability of individuals by upgrading basic skills, through the provision
of courses such as remedial education or English-as-a-second-language, shall be considered as remedial education
approvable under &sect;617.22(a) if the criteria for approval of training under &sect;617.22(a) are met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions for approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Training shall be approved for an adversely affected worker if the State agency determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There is no suitable employment (which may include technical and professional employment) available for an adversely
affected worker.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) This means that for the worker for whom approval of training is being considered under this section, no suitable
employment is available at that time for that worker, either in the commuting area, as defined in &sect;617.3(k),
or outside the commuting area in an area in which the worker desires to relocate with the assistance of a relocation
allowance under subpart E of this part, and there is no reasonable prospect of such suitable employment becoming available
for the worker in the foreseeable future. For the purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section only, the term ``suitable
employment'' means, with respect to a worker, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's
past adversely affected employment, and wages for such work at not less that 80 percent of the worker's average weekly
wage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The worker would benefit from appropriate training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This means that there is a direct relationship between the needs of the worker for skills training or remedial education
and what would be provided by the training program under consideration for the worker, and that the worker has the mental
and physical capabilities to undertake, make satisfactory progress in, and complete the training. This includes
the further criterion that the individual will be job ready on completion of the training program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of such training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This means that, for that worker, given the job market conditions expected to exist at the time of the completion
of the training program, there is, fairly and objectively considered, a reasonable expectation that the worker will
find a job, using the skills and education acquired while in training, after completion of the training. Any determination
under this criterion must take into account that ``a reasonable expectation of employment'' does not require that
employment opportunities for the worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of the approved
training. This emphasizes, rather than negates, the point that there must be a fair and objective projection of job
market conditions expected to exist at the time of completion of the training.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training approved by the Secretary is reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private
sources (which may include area vocational education schools, as defined in section 195(2) of the Vocational Education
Act of 1963, and employers).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This means that training is reasonably accessible to the worker within the worker's commuting area at any governmental
or private training (or education) provider, particularly including on-the-job training with an employer, and
it means training that is suitable for the worker and meets the other criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. It also
means that emphasis must be given to finding accessible training for the worker, although not precluding training
outside the commuting area if none is available at the time within the worker's commuting area. Whether the training
is within or outside the commuting area, the training must be available at a reasonable cost as prescribed in paragraph
(a)(6) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In determining whether or not training is reasonably available, first consideration shall be given to training
opportunities available within the worker's normal commuting area. Training at facilities outside the worker's
normal commuting area should be approved only if such training is not available in the area or the training to be provided
outside the normal commuting area will involve less charges to TAA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The worker is qualified to undertake and complete such training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) This emphasizes the worker's personal qualifications to undertake and complete approved training. Evaluation
of the worker's personal qualifications must include the worker's physical and mental capabilities, educational
background, work experience and financial resources, as adequate to undertake and complete the specific training
program being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evaluation of the worker's financial ability shall include an analysis of the worker's remaining weeks of UI
and TRA payments in relation to the duration of the training program. If the worker's UI and TRA payments will be exhausted
before the end of the training program, it shall be ascertained whether personal or family resources will be available
to the worker to complete the training. It must be noted on the worker's record that financial resources were discussed
with the worker before the training was approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When adequate financial resources will not be available to the worker to complete a training program which exceeds
the duration of UI and TRA payments, the training shall not be approved and consideration shall be given to other training
opportunities available to the worker.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Such training is suitable for the worker and available at a reasonable cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Such training means the training being considered for the worker. Suitable for the worker means that paragraph
(a)(5) of this section is met and that the training is appropriate for the worker given the worker's capabilities,
background and experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Available at a reasonable cost means that training may not be approved at one provider when, all costs being considered,
training substantially similar in quality, content and results can be obtained from another provider at a lower total
cost within a similar time frame. It also means that training may not be approved when the costs of the training are unreasonably
high in comparison with the average costs of training other workers in similar occupations at other providers. This
criterion also requires taking into consideration the funding of training costs from sources other than TAA funds,
and the least cost to TAA funding of providing suitable training opportunities to the worker. Greater emphasis will
need to be given to these elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining the reasonable costs of training, particularly in view of the requirements in &sect;617.11(a) (2)
and (3) that TRA claimants be enrolled in and participate in training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the purpose of determining reasonable costs of training, the following elements shall be considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) Costs of a training program shall include tuition and related expenses (books, tools, and academic fees), travel
or transportation expenses, and subsistence expenses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) In determining whether the costs of a particular training program are reasonable, first consideration must be
given to the lowest cost training which is available within the commuting area. When training, substantially similar
in quality, content and results, is offered at more than one training provider, the lowest cost training shall be approved;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (C) Training at facilities outside the worker's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal commuting area that involves transportation or subsistence costs which add substantially to the total costs
shall not be approved if other appropriate training is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allowable amounts for training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In approving a worker's application for training, the conditions for approval in paragraph (a) of this section must
be found to be satisfied, including assurance that the training is suitable for the worker, is at the lowest reasonable
cost, and will enable the worker to obtain employment within a reasonable period of time. An application for training
shall be denied if it is for training in an occupational area which requires an extraordinarily high skill level and
for which the total costs of the training are substantially higher than the costs of other training which is suitable
for the worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Previous approval of training under State law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Training previously approved for a worker under State law or other authority is not training approved under paragraph
(a) of this section. Any such training may be approved under paragraph (a) of this section, if all of the requirements
and limitations of paragraph (a) of this section and other provisions of Subpart C of this part are met, but such approval
shall not be retroactive for any of the purposes of this Part 617, including payment of the costs of the training and
payment of TRA to the worker participating in the training. However, in the case of a redetermination or decision reversing
a determination denying approval of training, for the purposes of this Part 617 such redetermination or decision
shall be given effect retroactive to the issuance of the determination that was reversed by such redetermination
or decision; but no costs of training may be paid unless such costs actually were incurred for training in which the
individual participated, and no additional TRA may be paid with respect to any week the individual was not actually
participating in the training.

to the ``14-day break in training'' provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;617.15(d), for purposes of receiving TRA payments. An individual's approved training program may be amended
by the State agency to add a course designed to satisfy unforeseen needs of the individual, such as remedial education
or specific occupational skills, as long as the length of the amended training program does not exceed the 104-week

Training programs that may be approved under &sect;617.22(a) include, but are not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) On-the-job training, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Any training program provided by a State pursuant to Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) Any training program approved by a private industry council established under the Job Training Partnership Act,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) Any program of remedial education, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any training program (other than a training program described in paragraph (c) of &sect;617.25) for which all,
or any portion, of the costs of training the worker are paid_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Under any other Federal or State program other than this Subpart C, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From any other source other than this section, but not including sources personal to the individual, such as self,
relatives, or friends, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second sentence of amended section 236(a)(1) of the Act provides that an adversely affected worker shall be entitled
to have payment of the costs of training approved under the Act paid on the worker's behalf, subject, however, ``to
the limitations imposed by'' section 236. The limitations in section 236 which are implemented in this section concern
the restrictions on approval of training which are related directly or indirectly to the conditions on training which
are approvable or on the funding of training costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On-the-job training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The costs of on-the-job training approved Subpart C of this part for a worker, which are paid from TAA funds, shall be
paid in equal monthly installments. Such costs may be paid from TAA funds, and such training may be approved under subpart
C of this part, however, only if the State agency determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No currently employed individual is displaced by such eligible worker, including partial displacement such
as a reduction in the hours of non-overtime work, wages, or employment benefits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Such training does not impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) In the case of training which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, written
concurrence has been obtained from the concerned labor organization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) No other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job for which such eligible worker
is being trained; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The employer has not terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced the work force with
the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring the eligible worker; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The job for which the eligible worker is being trained is not being created in a promotional line that will infringe
in any way upon the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (7) Such training is not for the same occupation from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the worker was separated and with respect to which such worker's group was certified pursuant to section 222
of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(8) The employer certifies to the State agency that the employer will continue to employ the eligible worker for at
least 26 weeks after completing the training if the worker desires to continue such employment and the employer does
not have due cause to terminate such employment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The employer has not received payment under this Subpart C or under any other Federal law for any other on-the-job
training provided by such employer which failed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this
section or such other Federal law; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The employer has not taken, at any time, any action which violated the terms of any certification described in
paragraph (a)(8) of this section made by the employer with respect to any other on-the-job training provided by the
employer for which the employer has received a payment under Subpart C of this part (or the prior provisions of Subpart
C of this part).

Other authority and restrictions on funding_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 236(a) contains several provisions which allow the costs of a training program approved under the Act to be
paid_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Solely from TAA funds,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Solely from other public or private funds, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Partly from TAA funds and partly from other public or private funds,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
but also precludes the use of TAA funds or funds under another Federal law where such use of funds would result in duplication
of payment of training costs. Those authorities and restrictions are spelled out in paragraph (b) of this section:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 that, private funds may not include funds from sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 (i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (5)(E) of section 236(a) of the Act specifies one of the types of training programs approvable under the
Act, as including a program (other than a training program described in section 236(a)(7) (paragraph (b)(5) of this
section)) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of the training program are paid_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Under any Federal or State program other than the Act, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) From any source other than TAA funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (E) of section 236(a)(5) of the Act thus authorizes prearrangements between cooperating State agencies
administering the TAA program and the authorities administering any other Federal, State, or private funding source,
to agree upon any mix of TAA funds and other funds for paying the costs of a training program approved under Subpart C
of this part. Any such prearrangement must contain specific commitments from the other authorities to pay the costs
they agree to assume.

 (i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is related to section 236(a)(5)(E) in providing that the costs of a training
program approved under the Act are not required to be paid from TAA funds to the extent that such costs are paid under
any Federal or State program other than the Act or from any source other than the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Although paragraph (6) of section 236(a) of the Act is expressed in terms of the costs not being 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be paid from TAA funds, it authorizes the mixing of TAA funds and funds from any other Federal, State or private source.
Therefore, sharing the future costs of training is authorized where prior costs were paid from another Federal, State
or private source, but this does not authorize reimbursement from TAA funds of any training costs which were incurred
and for which payment became due prior to the approval of the training program under Subpart C of this part. In utilizing
the authority under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sharing training costs, prearrangements shall be entered
into as required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section before any TAA funds are obligated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Paragraph (6) of section 236(a) contains a special restriction on the authority derived thereunder to use TAA
funds in sharing training costs. Therefore, before approving any training program under Subpart C of this part, which
may involve sharing of the training costs under the authority of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the cooperating
State agencies for the TAA program shall require the worker to enter into a written agreement with the State under which
TAA funds will not be applied for or used to pay any portion of the costs of the training the worker has reason to believe
will be paid by any other governmental or private source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) of the Act (paragraph (3) of section 236(a) before August 23, 1988) continues to
provide, as it did before the addition of paragraphs (5)(E), (6), and (7) to section 236(a), that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) When the costs of training are paid from TAA funds under subpart C of this part, no other payment for such costs of training
may be made under any other Federal law; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) When the payment of the costs of training has already been made under any other Federal law, or the costs are reimbursable
under any other Federal law and a portion of the costs has already been paid under such other Federal law, payment of
such training costs may not be made from TAA funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) also requires that: The provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and (A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law
which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the identical costs incurred in training the adversely
affected worker under the TAA Program, even if such other use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion
of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Although the prohibition on duplicate payments in the first part of section 236(a)(4) remains fully implemented
in this section, the second part of section 236(a)(4) on the sharing of costs from TAA funds and other Federal fund sources
is modified by the explicit provisions of paragraphs (5)(E) and (6) of section 236(a), as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)
and (b)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When the direct costs of a training program approvable under subpart C of this part are payable from TAA funds and
are also wholly or partially payable under another Federal law, or under any State law or from private, nongovernmental
sources, the TAA Program agencies shall establish procedures which ensure that TAA funds shall not be utilized to
duplicate funds available from another source, but this preclusion of duplication does not prohibit and shall not
discourage sharing of costs under prearrangements authorized under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (4) of section 236(a), paragraph (b)(4) of this section continues to prohibit
duplicate payment of training costs, which is consistent with the general prohibition expressed in subpart C of this
part, against any use of TAA funds to duplicate payment of training costs in any circumstances. Paragraph (b)(4) of
this section also continues to prohibit taking into account, in determining whether training costs are payable from
TAA funds, any payments to the worker under any other Federal law which may have the effect of indirectly paying all

 Paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act provides that a training program shall not be approved under the Act if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under the Act, or from

 Paragraph (7) of section 236(a), which is implemented in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, reinforces the prohibition
in &sect;617.22(h) against approval of a training program under subpart C of this part if the worker is required to
pay a fee or tuition. The provisions of paragraph (b) and paragraph (h) of this section shall be given effect as prohibiting
the approval under subpart C of this part of any training program if the worker would be requested or required, at any
time or under any circumstances, to pay any of the costs of a training program, however small, from any TAA funds given
to the worker or from any other funds belonging to the worker from any source whatever. Aside from this stringent limitation,
however, paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act implicitly authorizes training approved under this subpart C
to be wholly or partly funded from nongovernmental (i.e., employer, union or other private) sources.

 Effective on November 21, 1988, in general, enrollment and participation in, or completion of, a training program
approved under subpart C is required as a condition of entitlement to basic TRA. Amendments to sections 231(a)(5),
231(b), and 231(c) of the Act incorporate this new requirement, replacing the job search program requirement which
remains in effect through November 20, 1988. Continuation of the job search program requirement through November
20, 1988, and installation of the training program requirement on and after November 21, 1988, is required of all applicants
for basic TRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility period for basic TRA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Effective on August 23, 1988, and with respect to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations,
and decisions on appeals) issued on or after that date, the eligibility period for basic TRA is changed from the prior
law. Prior to the OTCA amendments, section 233(a)(2) provided that the eligibility period for an individual was a
fixed 104-week period that immediately followed the week with respect to which the individual first exhausted all
rights to regular benefits after the individual's first qualifying separation. Under section 233(a)(2) the new
eligibility period is movable, and is the 104-week period that immediately follows the week in which the worker's
most recent total qualifying separation occurs under the same, single certification. Under the effective date provisions
of the OTCA, section 233(a)(2) applies to all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions
on appeals) issued on and after August 23, 1988. Further, the law to be applied in making any such decision is the law
as in effect on the date such a decision is made. These interpretative rules apply in all cases, regardless of whether
the total qualifying separation occurred before, on, or after August 23, 1988, except as noted in paragraph (e)(3)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The major significance of the change in section 233(a)(2) is that, effective for all decisions (i.e., determinations,
redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) issued on or after August 23, 1988, it applies to the ``most recent''
total qualifying separation. This means that, after the first qualifying separation before August 23, 1988, or the
first total qualifying separation on and after August 23, 1988, with each subsequent total qualifying separation
of an individual under the same certification the individual's eligibility period must be redetermined as the 104-week
period that immediately follows the week in which such subsequent separation occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 1430(g) of the OTCA requires that the new eligibility period not be applied with respect to any total qualifying
separation occurring before August 23, 1988, if as a result of applying section 233(a)(2) the individual would have
an eligibility period with an earlier expiration date than the expiration date of the eligibility period established
under the prior law and based on a first qualifying separation which occurred under the same certification before
August 23, 1988. Therefore, for decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals)
issued on or after August 23, 1988, for a worker who had a first qualifying separation under the same certification
before August 23, 1988, it must be determined what the individual's eligibility period is based upon the prior law,
and, if the individual also had a subsequent total qualifying separation, what the individual's eligibility period
is based on the amended law. Only if the subsequent total qualifying separation occurred before August 23, 1988, and
the expiration date of the new eligibility period ends on the same date or a later date than the expiration date of the
old eligibility period may the new eligibility period be applied to the individual, and in that event it must be applied;
if the new eligibility period would end on a date earlier than the ending date of the eligibility period based on the
worker's first qualifying separation, section 1430(g) operates to preclude the application of amended section
233(a)(2).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Computation of the weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA do not change under the 1988 Amendments in the OTCA. They
must continue to be based upon the first benefit period which is related to the worker's first total or partial separation
under the same certification regardless of whether such first separation occurs before, on, or after August 23, 1988.
Upon the occurrence of a second or subsequent separation under the same certification which is a total qualifying
separation under this part 617, the individual's eligibility period will be 104 weeks after the week of such second
or subsequent (total qualifying) separation, but no change will be made in the weekly or maximum amounts of basic TRA
as computed in relation to the first separation. Therefore, for any decision (i.e., determination, redetermination,
or decision on appeal) issued on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after August 23, 1988, whenever an individual files a new TRA claim it will be necessary to determine whether the individual's
most recent separation was a total qualifying separation, and, if so, whether the individual had a prior partial or
total separation within the certification period of the same certification which was a first qualifying separation.
If such most recent (total qualifying) separation occurred before August 23, 1988, and was not the individual's first
qualifying separation, then:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The eligibility period will be the 104 weeks beginning with the week following the week in which the most recent
total qualifying separation occurred 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 104 weeks after the first exhaustion of regular UI following the first qualifying separation, whichever is longer,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The individual's weekly amount of basic TRA, as computed under &sect;617.13, and the individual's maximum amount
of basic TRA, as computed under &sect;617.14, are established or remain fixed as determined with respect to the individual's
first benefit period following the first separation which is within the certification period of the certification
covering the individual.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility period for additional TRA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One technical and one conforming change are made by the OTCA in section 233(a)(3) of the Act, but have no effect on the
26-week eligibility period for additional TRA as the statute has been interpreted and applied in the past. Therefore,
the 26-week eligibility period begins with the first week of training if the training begins after exhaustion of basic
TRA. Further, if the training begins before approval is obtained under this part 617, the 26-week eligibility period
begins with the week in which the determination of approval is issued, if there is any scheduled training session in
that week after the date of the determination.

Eligibility for TRA during breaks in training. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act, added by the OTCA, provides for the payment, under specified conditions,
of both basic and additional TRA during scheduled breaks in a training program, provided the conditions for such payments
are met as expressed in this part 617. By making this provision applicable to basic TRA as well as additional TRA, paragraph
(f) of section 233 of the Act changes the prior law for both. Previously, basic TRA was payable during training breaks,
but additional TRA was payable solely with respect to weeks of training. Under new section 233(f), both basic and additional
TRA are payable during training breaks, but only if the break does not exceed 14 days. Now, as under the prior law, weeks
when TRA is not payable will still count against the eligibility periods for both basic and additional TRA, and in the
case of additional TRA it will also count against the number of weeks payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act is effective with regard to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations,
and decisions on appeals) made on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of when the training was approved under section
236 of the Trade Act, or whether the training was approved or is approvable under section 236 as amended by the 1988 Amendments,
or when the break in training began or ended. In making any decision involving paragraph (f) of section 233 of the Act,
the law to be applied is the law as in effect on the date the decision is made.

Retroactive eligibility for TRA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Effective on August 23, 1988, section 1425(b) of the OTCA provides for an open-ended waiver of the time limit in
section 233(a)(2) on the eligibility period for basic TRA, and the 210-day time limit in section 233(b) on filing a
bona fide application for training in order to qualify for additional TRA. This waiver provision applies solely to
workers who experienced a total qualifying separation in the period which began on August 13, 1981 and ended on April
7, 1986. Other conditions must be met that are specified in section 1425(b) and in this part 617. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Altogether, nine conditions must be met for workers to obtain TRA payments under this special provision. (See
&sect;617.11(a)(3).) Further, this special provision applies solely to weeks which begin after August 23, 1988;
no retroactive payments may be made under this special provision. Finally, only the two specific time limitations
are waived, and all other requirements of the prior and amended law apply, including the first separation rule (relating
to computation of the weekly and maximum amounts of basic TRA payable), the 26-week eligibility period for additional

Section 239 also was amended by the OTCA, to require new terms and conditions in the section 239 agreements. This requires
new agreements to be executed between the States and the Secretary of Labor, and gives new emphasis to the contractual
nature of the obligations entered into by the States to administer the TAA Program in strict accordance with the Act
and the regulations and operating instructions issued by the Department.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Secretary's interpretation of federal law requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Secretary interprets section 3304(a)(1) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and section 303(a)(2) of the Social
Security Act to require that a State law provide for payment of unemployment compensation solely through public employment
offices or claims offices administered by the State employment security agency if such agency provides for such coordination
in the operations of its public employment offices and claims offices as will insure (a) the payment of benefits only
to individuals who are unemployed and who are able to work and available for work, and (b) that individuals claiming
unemployment compensation (claimants) are afforded such placement and other employment services as are necessary
and appropriate to return them to suitable work as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Such contact by claimants with public employment offices or claims offices or both, (1) as will reasonably insure

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 A. Claim filing_total or part-total unemployment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Individuals claiming unemployment compensation for total or part-total unemployment are required to file a claim
weekly or biweekly, in person or by mail, at a public employment office or a claims office (these terms include offices
at itinerant points) as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Except as provided in paragraph 3, a claimant is required to file in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. His new claim with respect to a benefit year, or his continued claim for a waiting week or for his first compensable
week of unemployment in such year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Any other claim, when requested to do so by the claims personnel at the office at which he files his claim(s) because
questions about his right to benefits are raised by circumstances such as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The conditions or circumstances of his separation from employment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claim(s) indicate that he may be unable to work or that there may be undue
restrictions on his availability for work or that his search for work may be inadequate or that he may be disqualified;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claimant's answers to questions on mail claims create uncertainty about his credibility or indicate a lack
of understanding of the applicable requirements; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The claimant's record shows that he has previously filed a fraudulent claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such circumstances, the claimant is required to continue to file claims in person each week (or biweekly) until
the State agency determines that filing claims in person is no longer required for the resolution of such questions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A claimant must be permitted to file a claim by mail in any of the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. He is located in an area requiring the expenditure of an unreasonable amount of time or money in traveling to the nearest
facility established by the State agency for filing claims in person; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Conditions make it impracticable for the agency to take claims in person; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. He has returned to full-time work on or before the scheduled date for his filing a claim, unless the agency makes provision
for in-person filing at a time and place that does not interfere with his employment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The agency finds that he has good cause for failing to file a claim in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A claimant who has been receiving benefits for partial unemployment may continue to file claims as if he were a partially
unemployed worker for the first four consecutive weeks of total or part-total unemployment immediately following
his period of partial unemployment so long as he remains attached to his regular employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Claim filing_partial unemployment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each individual claiming unemployment compensation for a week (or other claim period) during which, because of lack
of work, he is working less than his normal customary full-time hours for his regular employer and is earning less than
the earnings limit provided in the State law, shall not be required to file a claim for such week or other claim period
earlier than 2 weeks from the date that wages are paid for such claim period or, if a low earnings report is required by
the State law, from the date the employer furnished such report to the individual. State agencies may permit claims
for partial unemployment to be filed either in person or by mail, except that in the circumstances set forth in section
A 3, filing by mail must be permitted, and in the circumstances set forth in section A 2 b, filing in person may be required.

Requirement for Job Finding, Placement, and Other Employment Services Designed to Satisfy Secretary's Interpretation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Claims personnel are required to assure that each claimant is doing what a reasonable individual in his circumstances
would do to obtain suitable work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. In the discretion of the State agency: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The claims personnel are required to give each claimant such necessary and appropriate assistance as they reasonably
can in finding suitable work and at their discretion determine when more complete placement and employment services
are necessary and appropriate for a claimant; and if they determine more complete services are necessary and appropriate,
the claims personnel are to refer him to employment service personnel in the public employment office in which he has
been filing claim(s), or, if he has been filing in a claims office, in the public employment office most accessible
to him; or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All placement and employment services are required to be afforded to each claimant by employment service personnel
in the public employment office most accessible to him in which case the claims personnel in the office in which the
claimant files his claim are to refer him to the employment service personnel when placement or other employment services
are necessary and appropriate for him. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The personnel to whom the State agency assigns the responsibilities outlined in paragraph B above are required
to give claimants such job-finding assistance, placement, and other employment services as are necessary and appropriate
to facilitate their return to suitable work as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some circumstances, no such services or only limited services may be required. For example, if a claimant is on a
short-term temporary layoff with a fixed return date, the only service necessary and appropriate to be given to him
during the period of the layoff is a referral to suitable temporary work if such work is being performed in the labor
market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, claimants whose unemployment is caused by a labor dispute presumably will return to work with their employer
as soon as the labor dispute is settled. They generally do not need services, nor do individuals in occupations where
placement customarily is made by other nonfee charging placement facilities such as unions and professional associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants who fall within the classes which ordinarily would require limited services or no services shall, if they
request placement and employment services, be afforded such services as are necessary and appropriate for them to
obtain suitable work or to achieve their reasonable employment goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, a claimant who is permanently separated from his job is likely to require some services. He may need
only some direction in how to get a job; he may need placement services if he is in an occupation for which there is some
demand in the labor market area; if his occupation is outdated, he may require counseling and referral to a suitable
training course. The extent and character of the services to be given any particular claimant may change with the length
of his unemployment and depend not only on his own circumstances and conditions, but also on the condition of the labor
market in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Claimants are required to report to employment service personnel, as directed, but such personnel and the claims
personnel required to so arrange and coordinate the contacts required of a claimant as not to place an unreasonable
burden on him or unreasonably limit his opportunity to establish his rights to compensation. As a general rule, a claimant
is not required to contact in person claims personnel or employment service personnel more frequently than once a
week, unless he is directed to report more frequently for a specific service such as referral to a job or a training course
or counseling which cannot be completed in one visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Employment service personnel are required to report promptly to claims personnel in the office in which the claimant
files his claim(s): (1) his failure to apply for or accept work to which he was referred by such personnel or when known,
by any other nonfee-charging placement facility such as a union or a professional association; and (2) any information
which becomes available to it that may have a bearing on the claimant's ability to work or availability for work, or
on the suitability of work to which he was referred or which was offered to him.

Evaluation of Alternative State Provisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
If the State law provisions do not conform to the ``suggested State law requirements'' set forth in sections 5001 and
5002, but the State law contains alternative provisions, the Manpower Administrator, in collaboration with the
State agency, will study the actual or anticipated affect of the alternative provisions. If the Manpower Administrator
concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy the requirements of the Federal law as construed by the Secretary
(see section 5000 B) he will so notify the State agency. If he does not so conclude, he will submit the matter to the Secretary.
If the Secretary concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy such requirements, the State agency will be so
notified. If the Secretary concludes that there is a question as to whether the alternative provisions satisfy such
requirements, the State agency will be advised that unless the State law provisions are appropriately revised, a
notice of hearing will be issued as required by the Code of Federal Regulations, title 20, section 601.3.
