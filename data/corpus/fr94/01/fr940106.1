Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 10, 1990, Pratt &amp; Whitney applied for type certification of PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan
engines. The FAA has determined that the current foreign object ingestion requirements of &sect;33.77(a) for four
pound birds; and &sect;33.77(b) for one and one-half pound flocking birds, do not adequately represent the bird threat
encountered in service. A study of in-service bird ingestion events has indicated a need to modify the bird ingestion
requirements of this section to ensure design integrity and demonstrate an adequate level of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that additional safety standards must be applied to Pratt &amp; Whitney Model(s) PW4073 and
PW4048 turbofan engines to demonstrate that they are capable of acceptable operation after medium and large bird
ingestion. The applicable airworthiness requirements do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards
for type certification with respect to the new design criteria. This new design criteria assumes the actual bird threat
encountered in service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Type of Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the FAR, Pratt &amp; Whitney must show that the PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084
turbofan engines meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those
Federal Aviation Regulations are &sect;21.21 and part 33, effective February 1, 1965, as amended through August
10, 1990, Amendment 33&hyph;14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for the PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan engines because of its unique design
criteria. Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions under the provisions of &sect;21.16
to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice and
opportunity for comment, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification
basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action affects only PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4048 turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general applicability
and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these new design criteria on the engine.

The Proposed Special Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the Pratt &amp; Whitney Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan engines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In lieu of the requirements of FAR &sect;33.77(a) and (b), the following tests and analyses must be conducted, unless
compliance can be shown by alternate methods acceptable to the Administrator:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) It must be shown that the ingestion of a single large bird, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix A, will not
cause the engine to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) catch fire;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) release hazardous fragments through the engine casing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified under &sect;33.23(a);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) lose the ability to be shut down; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Alternatively, if compliance with the bird ingestion requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition
is not established, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with the containment requirements of &sect;33.94(a)
constitutes a more severe demonstration than the requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition. The engine
type certification documentation will then be endorsed to reflect this alternative compliance method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) It must be shown that the ingestion of medium birds, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix B, will not cause
the engine to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sustain more than a 25 percent thrust loss;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be shut down during the required run-on demonstration prescribed in Appendix B;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Exceed any engine operating limitations to the extent that the engine cannot comply with this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) It must be shown that engine spinner impact by one large bird and by the single largest medium bird, under the respective
conditions prescribed in Appendices A and B, will not affect the engine to the extent that it cannot comply with the
requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b of this special condition.

Appendix B_Medium Bird Ingestion Test Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The ingestion test shall be conducted with the engine stabilized at rated takeoff thrust for the test day ambient
conditions prior to the ingestion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The test shall be conducted to simulate a flock encounter, with all birds ingested within approximately one second,
and using the more severe of the following bird weight/quantity combinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Six 1.5-pound and one 2.5-pound birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Four 2.5-pound birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Bird targeting shall be one 2.5-pound bird at the core primary flow path, and the remaining birds targeted at critical
fan rotor locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Bird ingestion velocity shall be the most critical velocity between V1 minimum through 250 knots.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 4, 1992, Rolls-Royce applied for type certification of Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;870&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines. The application for type certification of the Model RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;870&hyph;17 turbofan
engine was withdrawn and a new application for type certification of the Model RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17
was made on April 6, 1993. The FAA has determined that the current water and hail ingestion requirements of &sect;33.77(c)
of the FAR do not represent the inclement weather threat encountered in service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study of in-service inclement weather events has indicated a need to modify the water and hail ingestion requirements
of this section to ensure design integrity and demonstrate an adequate level of safety. This study indicated that
a potential flight safety threat existed for engines when operating in severe weather environments. Although current
requirements provide adequate validation of the engine's resistance to mechanical damage due to hail impact and
case contractions from water ingestion, the study showed that the current standards did not adequately address engine
power loss anomalies, such as rollback and flameout at lower than take off rated power settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that additional safety standards must be applied to Rolls-Royce Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines to demonstrate that they are capable of acceptable operation in severe weather environments.

Type Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the FAR, Rolls-Royce must show that Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those
Federal Aviation Regulations are &sect;21.21 and Part 33, effective February 1, 1965, as amended through August
10, 1990, Amendment 33&hyph;14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for Rolls-Royce Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines because of unique design criteria. Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions
under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice and
opportunity for comment, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification
basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action affects only Rolls-Royce Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA
for approval of these new design criteria on the engine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the Rolls-Royce Model(s) RB211&hyph;Trent&hyph;875&hyph;17/&hyph;877&hyph;17/&hyph;884&hyph;17
turbofan engines.

In addition to the requirements of FAR &sect;33.77, the following tests and analyses must be conducted, unless compliance
can be shown by alternate methods acceptable to the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The most critical operating point(s) for water and hail ingestion must be determined by test, analysis, or other
acceptable methods, and must be based on the threat levels defined in Table 1 and Table 2 of this proposal. The critical
point(s) determination must address the entire operating envelope of the engine. The critical operating point(s)
is defined as those operating conditions within the engine flight envelope at which an engine operability margin
is reduced to a minimum level.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace (Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above
the surface of the earth) at Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway
29 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above
ground level (AGL) is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this proposal is to
provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft
operating in visual weather conditions.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace to Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate NDB Runway 29 SIAP. Controlled airspace extending
from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action is
to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft
operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined area which would
enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The EPA is taking action to approve the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission State II State Implementation
Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP Supplement dated September 30, 1992, and Regulation V (31 TAC Section 115 Subchapter
C: Volatile Organic Compound Marketing Operations), as a revision to the Texas SIP for ozone. On November 13, 1992,
Texas submitted a SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the Clean Air Act, as amended (1990). This SIP revision
requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment
in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse. This revision applies to the Texas counties
of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Jefferson, Liberty,
Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller.

Under section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of
Stage II systems. The EPA issued technical guidance in November 1991, and enforcement guidance in December 1991,
to meet this requirement.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, on April 16, 1992, the EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret
the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what the EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that
requirement.

The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston/Brazoria ozone
nonattainment area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort
Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is
classified as serious and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The El Paso ozone
nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment
area is classified as moderate and contains the following four counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The
designations for ozone were published in the

 (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See
56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437.
Under section 182(b)(3) of the amended CAA, Texas was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for these areas
by November 15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, Governor Ann W. Richards submitted to the EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules
and a SIP Supplement dated September 30, 1992, which were adopted by the State on October 16, 1992. By today's action,
the EPA is proposing to approve this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory requirements
and for consistency with the EPA guidance. A summary of the EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, a more detailed
analysis of the State submittal is contained in a TSD, dated June 25, 1993, which is available from the Region 6 Office,
listed above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, States were required by November 15, 1992, to adopt regulations requiring owners
or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities.
The amended CAA specifies that these State rules must apply to any facility that dispenses more than 10,000 gallons
of gasoline per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer, any facility that dispenses more than
50,000 gallons of gasoline per month. Section 324 of the CAA defines an independent small business marketer. The State
has adopted a general applicability requirement of 10,000 gallons per month and has not included a lower applicability
for independent small business marketers. However, independent small business marketer which dispense less than
50,000 gallons have a provision for an extended compliance deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As more fully discussed in the EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR at 13514), the State has provided
that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be based on the gasoline throughput for each calendar month beginning
January 1, 1991. The State is interpreting this requirement to mean that if a facility exceeds the throughput limits
for any one month, the facility will be required to install Stage II. While the State is not calculating the average
volume of gasoline dispensed per month for the two year period preceding the adoption date, the EPA believes that the
State's method will require more gasoline dispensing facilities to comply with Stage II requirements. In addition,
the State has specified that the State II requirements apply to all gasoline dispensing facilities, including retail
outlets and fleet fueling facilities, with throughput rates as defined above. However, the State has exempted gasoline
dispensing equipment used exclusively for the fueling of aircraft, marine vessels, or implements of agriculture.
The EPA has determined that these limited exemptions are acceptable in the Texas Stage II program for the following
reasons. Historically, the Stage II program was intended to reduce refueling emissions for ``on-road'' motor vehicles.
These limited exemptions would not be considered to be on-road motor vehicles. Also, refueling systems of gasoline
powered vehicles such as aircraft, marine vessels, and implements of agriculture are normally designed with nonstandardized
equipment for which Stage II systems designed for on-road vehicle refueling facilities may not be compatible. The
acceptability of these limited exemptions does not preclude the State from requiring refueling vapor recovery systems
at such facilities at a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 324 establishes a statutory definition of an independent small business marketer, which is fully set forth
in the TSD. The State has adopted the statutory definition of independent small business marketer in its regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA finds the applicability requirements in the Texas Stage II rule to be acceptable.

II. Implementation of Stage II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAA specifies the time by which certain facilities must comply with the State regulation. For facilities that
are not owned or operated by an independent small business marketer, these times, calculated from the time of State
adoption of the regulation, are: (1) Six months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990,
(2) one year for facilities that dispense greater than 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month, and (3) two years for
all other facilities. The Texas Stage II rule time schedule sets compliance dates of May 15, 1993, November 15, 1993,
and November 15, 1994, respectively for the above three deadlines. Although Texas adopted its Stage II regulations
on October 16, 1992, the EPA believes it is appropriate to accept the adoption date to be November 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to approve the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the CAA states that the adoption
date must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, the
EPA defines the adoption date to be the date when the regulation and the rest of the SIP was required to be submitted to
the EPA on November 15, 1992. The compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin within the time schedule specified
by the CAA. Secondly, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause further delay in
the implementation of Stage II in Texas. Lastly, the Texas rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and the
EPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, the EPA believes
it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at the earliest time feasible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Texas program, independent small business marketers of gasoline, for which the monthly gasoline throughput
is less than 50,000 gallons per month, may petition, no later than November 15, 1993, the State's Executive Director
for an extension of the compliance deadline to December 22, 1998, or until on or more of the facility's gasoline storage
tanks are replaced and/or equipped with corrosive protection, which is required by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission. This extension provision for independent small business marketers of gasoline, for which the monthly
gasoline throughput is less than 50,000 gallons per month, is acceptable because the CAA does not require Stage II
systems to be installed on such facilities.

III. Additional Program Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the EPA's guidance, the State requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a 95 percent
emission reduction efficiency. The EPA has indicated three acceptable methods of demonstrating a 95 percent emission
reduction efficiency: (1) A method tested and approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB); (2) a testing
program that is equivalent to the CARB program, that will be conducted by the Program Oversight Agency or by a third
party recognized by the Program Oversight Agency, and submitted and approved by the EPA for incorporation into the
SIP; or (3) a system approved by CARB. The State has chosen to use option three, a system approved by CARB. The State requires
sources to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid blockage test and
a leak test prior to system operation and at least every five years or upon major modification of a facility (i.e., 75
percent or more equipment change).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to recordkeeping, the State has adopted those items recommended in the EPA's guidance and specifies
that sources subject to Stage II must make these documents available upon request: (1) A copy of the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order for the specific Stage II vapor recovery system installed at the facility,
(2) results of verification tests, (3) equipment maintenance and compliance file logs indicating compliance with
manufacturer's specifications and requirements, (4) training certification files, and (5) inspection and compliance
records. In addition, the State has committed in their SIP supplement to maintain a general compliance file, including
information such as facility name, address, phone number, owner/operator names, a State assigned reference number,
date of initial compliance with the regulations, number of pumps and monthly gasoline throughput. The State has also
established an inspection function consistent with that described in the EPA's guidance. The State commits to conducting
inspections of facilities including a visual inspection of the Stage II equipment and of the required records and
a functional test of the Stage II equipment. According to the Supplement, the State shall inspect each facility at
least one time per year with follow-up inspections at noncomplying facilities. Finally, the State has established
procedures for enforcing violations of the Stage II requirements, and has committed to establish a penalty schedule
in the SIP. A detailed draft penalty schedule has already been developed by the State. Administrative penalties may
be assessed of up to $10,000 per day per violation and civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day per violation. The EPA
finds the State's program for implementation and enforcement of the Stage II program to be consistent with the EPA
guidelines.

Rulemaking Action

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the EPA finds that the State has adopted a Stage II SIP in accordance with section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, as interpreted
in EPA's guidance, the EPA is proposing to approve the submittal as meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Regulatory Process

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 et. seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility
analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604). Alternatively,
the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small
entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions from the requirements of section three of Executive Order 12291 for a period
of two years (54 FR 2222). The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions.
The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request is
still applicable under Executive Order 12866.

RCRA section 3001(b)(3) (hereafter referred to as the Bevill Exemption) exempts, among other things, cement kiln
dust waste from regulation under RCRA subtitle C, pending completion of a Report to Congress and a subsequent determination
of whether such regulation is warranted. In RCRA section 8002(o), Congress directed EPA to conduct a detailed and
comprehensive study based on eight study factors (discussed below) and submit a Report to Congress on ``the adverse
effects on human health and the environment, if any, of the disposal and utilization of cement kiln dust waste''. RCRA
section 3001(b)(3)(C) then requires that EPA determine, within six months of the date of submission of the Report
to Congress, either to promulgate regulations for CKD under subtitle C or determine that subtitle C regulation is
unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bevill Exemption was added to RCRA on October 12, 1980, as part of the 1980 Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendment. In
response to the 1980 RCRA amendments, EPA published an interim final amendment to its hazardous waste regulations
to reflect the provisions of the Bevill Exemption (40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)). Since that time, cement kiln dust has remained
exempt from subtitle C of RCRA, meaning that this material has never been subject to hazardous waste regulations under
Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1989, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed suit against EPA for failing to complete the RTC as required
by RCRA. On June 19, 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree with EDF. In the proposed consent decree, EPA agreed
to complete the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust by April 30, 1993. The proposed consent decree was later modified
to extend the deadline for issuance of the Report to Congress to December 31, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA has completed its study of CKD waste and prepared the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust. In keeping with the
statutory requirements, the report addresses the following factors (hereafter ``study factors'') required under
section 8002(o) of RCRA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The source and volumes of such materials generated per year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Present disposal practices; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Potential danger, if any, to human health and the environment from the disposal of such materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Documented cases in which danger to human health or the environment has been proved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Alternatives to current disposal methods; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The costs of such alternatives; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The impact of those alternatives on the use of natural resources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The current and potential utilization of such materials.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition, section 8002(o) directs the Agency review other Federal and state studies and actions (e.g., regulations)
to avoid duplication of effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency's approach in preparing the Report to Congress was to combine certain study factors for purposes of analysis
and to evaluate these study factors in a step-wise fashion. This evaluation process, hereafter referred to as EPA's
decision rationale, is a three-step methodology that was used in making the regulatory determinations for Mineral
Processing Special Wastes (56 FR 27305, June 13, 1991) and the four large-volume Wastes from the Combustion of Coal
by Electric Utilities (58 FR 42466, August 9, 1993). The decision rationale contributed to the development of the
proposed options for managing CKD waste. EPA is soliciting comment on how the decision rationale can be used in the
Agency's decision-making process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting review and discussion of EPA's analysis is organized into ten chapters in Volume II of the Report to Congress:
Methods and Findings. (Volume I is an Executive Summary.) The first chapter of Volume II briefly summarizes the purpose
and scope of the report, general methods and information sources used, and EPA's decision making methodology. The
second chapter provides a brief overview of the cement industry, including a description of CKD waste, the industry
structure and characteristics, the cement manufacturing process, the types of production processes used, and significant
process inputs (RCRA Study Factor 1). The third chapter discusses the generation and chemical and physical characteristics
of CKD (Study Factors 1 and 3). The fourth chapter outlines the range of CKD management methods employed at domestic
cement plants (Study Factor 2). The fifth chapter identifies and summarizes cases of potential and documented damages
to human health and the environment (Study Factor 4). The sixth chapter includes a discussion of EPA's risk assessment
in which the Agency examined inherent hazards posed by CKD, evaluated site-specific risk factors, and performed
quantitative transport, fate and exposure modeling (Study Factor 3). The seventh chapter summarizes applicable
federal and state regulatory controls. The eighth chapter investigates alternative waste management practices
and potential utilization of the wastes (Study Factors 5, 6, and 7). The ninth chapter discusses costs and impacts
under each of several regulatory and operational scenarios (Study Factor 8). The tenth and final chapter of Volume
II of the Report to Congress summarizes and analyzes the findings of EPA's evaluation of the above study factors and
presents a series of options the Agency is considering, based on these findings, concerning the management of cement
kiln dust.

C. Decision Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
After studying cement kiln dust, the Agency used the decision rationale to evaluate the findings of the study factors,
and to formulate a series of options being considered regarding the level of control needed for CKD. In Step 1 of the
decision rationale, the Agency first determined whether the management of CKD poses human health/environmental
problems and the potential for current practices to cause problems in the future. In Step 2, the Agency looked at waste
management practices and existing regulations to examine the potential for releases and exposure under current
practices. In Step 3, the Agency evaluated the costs and impacts associated with regulating this waste under Subtitle
C and, possibly, other regulatory scenarios.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The rationale for the order of questions is that cement kiln dust should first be considered to present risk to human
health or the environment or a potential risk under plausible mismanagement scenarios before the Agency considers
it for regulation under RCRA subtitle C. Second, before it considers regulating the waste under subtitle C, the Agency
should determine that current management practices and existing state and Federal regulatory controls are inadequate
to limit the risks posed by a waste. Then it should consider whether subtitle C regulation would be effective and appropriate.
Finally, the special statutory status of the waste requires that the Agency consider the impacts to the industry that
regulation under subtitle C would create in making a decision to regulate the waste as hazardous. Therefore, the decision
rationale allows EPA to systematically narrow its focus as to whether the waste may present significant risk of harm
and whether additional regulatory controls are necessary and desirable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tentative answers to the questions posed in its three-step decision rationale are discussed below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 1: Does management of CKD pose human health and environmental problems? Might current practices cause problems
in the future? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing evidence of damage to human health and the environment, performing a risk assessment, and reviewing
the results of laboratory analyses of waste samples, EPA has concluded that risks associated with CKD management
are generally low, however, there is a potential under certain circumstances for CKD to pose a danger to human health
and environment, and may do so in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data collected from state files and EPA site visits identify common CKD waste management practices, including management
in exposed, unlined piles, abandoned quarries, and landfills, that have caused, and may continue to cause, contamination
of air and nearby surface water and ground water. Management practices such as disposal in a water-filled quarry and
management in piles adjacent to grazing and agricultural fields or surface water bodies also pose a potential danger
to human health and the environment. In addition, risk modeling results supports the conclusion that CKD can potentially
pose risks to human health and the environment under certain hypothetical, yet plausible scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 2: Is more stringent regulation necessary or desirable? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reached no conclusions with respect to the need for more stringent regulation. EPA's preliminary analysis
of the effectiveness of State and Federal regulations and controls suggests that additional controls should be evaluated;
for example, controls for CKD management scenarios which potentially present high risks, if those scenarios exist.
While CKD is regulated under State and local laws, the specific requirements for CKD vary from state to state. In many
instances, minimal controls are applied to these wastes. Also, recycling technologies could be used as a means to
improve waste management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 3: What would be the operational and economic consequences of a decision to regulate CKD under subtitle C? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operational costs of CKD regulation are largely dependent on the management alternative selected. If CKD is managed
as a hazardous waste under RCRA subtitle C, facilities that manage their CKD through on-site land disposal are estimated
to incur significant compliance costs. However, the financial burden of compliance, even for waste dust generated
in kilns that burn RCRA hazardous waste, may be reduced, if facilities are able to adopt pollution prevention technologies
which recycle CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possible economic outcomes of a decision to regulate CKD under RCRA subtitle C cover a broad spectrum. An economic
analysis of innovative pollution prevention technologies (including alkali leaching, flue gas desulfurization,
and fluid-bed dust recovery), suggests that the potentially high compliance costs of CKD land disposal may drive
the industry toward more recycling of their CKD. However, at this early stage of their development, it is uncertain
that these recycling technologies can be widely adopted by the industry. Moreover, even if CKD is recycled, some facilities
may incur substantial disposal costs.

D. Regulatory Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This section presents a series of options the Agency is considering concerning the management of cement kiln dust
waste based on the findings of this Report. In accordance with RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C), EPA will make a regulatory
determination for cement kiln dust waste after submitting this Report to Congress, and after holding a public hearing,
and accepting and reviewing public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, cement kiln dust waste generally presents a low inherent toxicity, is only rarely characteristically
hazardous, and, in most cases based on risk modeling, does not present a risk to human health and the environment. However,
cement kiln dust waste may pose a potential threat to human health and the environment considering plausible worst
case conditions under certain hypothetical management scenarios (see Chapters 5 and 6). Major factors increasing
the potential for human health and environmental damages include proximity to potential exposure points such as
agricultural fields and surface water bodies, as well as the concentrations of key constituents of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the findings, and an initial evaluation of regulatory options, the Agency has not decided whether to retain
or remove the CKD exemption. The Agency considered a number of options which represent a wide range of scenarios that
would subject CKD to different management requirements and enforcement oversight. From these, the Agency has chosen
to highlight five, including three in which CKD would be managed under subtitle C, with the intent to focus public comment
from environmental groups, industry, and other interested parties regarding the most appropriate approach to manage
CKD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA notes that regulations for the management of CKD waste under subtitle C may not be warranted or appropriate if other
Agency-administered programs are better suited to address the concerns identified in this Report. Among the statutes
that may have authority to address the indirect foodchain risks associated with CKD are the Clean Water Act (stormwater
management regulations), the Clean Air Act (the program defining the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (which gives the Agency authority to issue appropriate regulations
to address the risks from hazardous chemical substances or mixtures). These alternative authorities are being explored
and a decision to pursue regulation of CKD under one or more of these statutes may form the basis for a decision that subtitle
C regulation of CKD may be limited or even unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether or not the Agency lifts the exemption, dust suppression and storm water management at facilities that burn
hazardous waste, as well as on-site CKD management practices at all other facilities would be subject to current and
potential future regulation under the Federal Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and where such provisions exist, all
applicable state laws and regulations. Damages at existing CKD disposal sites also could be addressed by RCRA section
7003 and CERCLA section 104 and 106, if the site posed an imminent and substantial danger to human health and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1: Retain the CKD Exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since CKD exhibits low inherent toxicity and poses minimal risk when evaluating the various exposure pathways using
average or best case conditions, it may be appropriate to retain the exemption for cement kiln dust waste, that is,
maintain the status quo. Under this option, CKD management would continue to be regulated by the States, if at all.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2: Retain the CKD Exemption, but enter into discussions with the industry, in which they voluntarily implement
dust recycling technologies, reduce waste, and monitor and control certain off-site uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since certain management scenarios may present risks when assuming plausible worst case conditions and pollution
prevention alternatives may be promising in certain instances, the Agency could enter into discussions with the
cement manufacturing industry to urge it to implement selected waste minimization/pollution prevention technologies
or implement, more environmentally protective management practices, including controlling certain off-site
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, some of the potential higher risk situations that have been identified in the hypothetical scenarios
relate to on-site CKD management and derive from CKD releases from waste piles or other points via wind-blown dust
or storm water runoff or a combination of the two. These contaminant release situations may be controllable (and at
some facilities are currently being controlled) at relatively low cost by careful location of the waste pile and active
use of conventional dust suppression and storm water management practices. The Agency would hold discussions with
the industry to encourage them to voluntarily agree to implement these practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception to the above conclusion would appear to be the 15 percent or so of cement plants where CKD waste is managed
in areas of karst topography or other areas characterized by flow in fractured or cavernous bedrock, where leachate
may directly percolate to groundwater with little or no attenuation. For some of these facilities, the groundwater
pathway may become of increased concern, depending on other site specific considerations. Again, EPA would discuss
with the industry opportunities to either use appropriate liners or relocate the CKD management unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 20 percent of current net CKD generation is used off-site for a wide variety of purposes, most of which according
to the Agency's risk assessment do not pose human health or other risks. However, the use of raw CKD containing higher
measured levels of certain metals and/or dioxins as a direct substitute for lime on agricultural fields and gardens
can concentrate toxic constituents in crops and animal products at levels of concern for human health. This use of
CKD, though not widely practiced at present, is otherwise not currently controlled, and may warrant further consideration
by the Agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency, under this option, could also develop guidance for States regarding site management, off-site uses,
and pollution prevention and waste minimization technologies. This guidance would assist States in reducing the
potential risks posed by mismanagement of CKD and recommend implementation of technologies that would promote recycling
of CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this option, CKD management would not be controlled by the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. However, since the
exemption for CKD remains in place, CKD generated in kilns that burn hazardous waste would still be subject to the two-part
test for residuals under 40 CFR 266.112. If CKD does not pass the two-part test, it would be treated to standards for
land disposal (40 CFR 268.43) and disposed in a subtitle C facility. Damages at existing CKD disposal sites would still
be addressed by RCRA section 7003 and CERCLA sections 104 and 106, if the site posed an imminent and substantial danger
to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3: Remove the CKD Exemption but delay implementation for some period of time (e.g., two years), that would allow
industry time to employ pollution prevention options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While CKD may not present risks when evaluating the various exposure pathways using average or best case conditions,
CKD may pose a potential danger to human health and the environment if managed in certain ways under a limited set of
exposure pathways assuming plausible worst case conditions. Also, damages to the environment resulting from poor
CKD management practices have been recorded and are continuing to occur at some facilities. For these reasons, removing
the Bevill exemption (codified at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)) may be appropriate. Accordingly, provisions of the Boiler
and Industrial Furnace rule (40 CFR 266.112) would no longer apply to hazardous waste-derived CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this option, on-site CKD management practices at those facilities with dust that exhibited any of the RCRA hazardous
waste characteristics, or CKD derived from the burning of listed hazardous wastes (see 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) would
be affected by the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. CKD disposal piles which are inactive on or before the effective date
of the Final Rule would be unaffected by the provisions of subtitle C, unless subsequently managed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By delaying lifting the exemption for some period of time (e.g., two years after the Regulatory Determination), industry
would be provided an opportunity to implement pollution prevention alternatives and thus, manage the hazardous
waste management costs they would incur. During this interim period between submittal of the Report to Congress and
the effective date of the Final Rule, the CKD exemption would still be in effect. The Agency believes that many of the
affected facilities would utilize the time to adopt pollution prevention technologies which would reduce, if not
eliminate the amount of hazardous CKD they generate or stop burning hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the exemption is removed, CKD generated from cement manufacturing facilities that burn RCRA hazardous wastes
would be RCRA hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The goal of avoiding subtitle
C compliance costs would provide an incentive for each facility to look for pollution prevention alternatives to
recycle their CKD and reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated. The Agency is requesting additional information
on the viability of the CKD recycling options discussed in the RTC and any other available pollution prevention or
recycling option not considered in the Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those facilities that do not burn hazardous waste would not generally be affected by removing the exemption unless
they generated characteristic RCRA hazardous waste. The Agency expects the number of non-hazardous waste burning
facilities affected by this option would be small, since CKD rarely exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste.
These facilities would have an incentive to control their cement manufacturing process to avoid generating characteristic
CKD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 4: Remove the CKD Exemption, and rely on existing hazardous waste rules to control cement kiln dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This option is similar to Option 3, except the exemption would be removed in accordance with RCRA section 3010(b).
(Under subtitle C of RCRA, wastes brought under regulatory control have up to six months from the Regulatory Determination
before they become subject to hazardous waste control.) Thus, CKD that is hazardous waste-derived or exhibits a RCRA
hazardous characteristic would be made subject to the provisions of RCRA subtitle C. Otherwise, this option is the
same as Option 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Option 5: Promulgate Regulatory Standards for the Management of CKD Waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated, the Agency's analysis of the risks associated with cement kiln dust suggest that by merely lifting
the exemption at 40 CFR 264.1(b)(8), certain pathways of potential concern under the hypothetical scenarios may
not be adequately addressed under Options 3 and 4, should EPA decide that subtitle C regulation is warranted for CKD
in the first instance. Specifically, EPA's risk assessment indicates indirect foodchain risks are of potential
concern from releases of CKD from disposal piles to nearby surface waters and crop lands and from the direct application
of CKD to croplands as a soil amendment assuming reasonable worst-case conditions. The Agency acknowledges, as discussed
in detail in Chapter 6, that these modelled risks, while plausible, are of probably minimal incidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, the likely regulatory result under Options 3 and 4 would be to make CKD generated by a kiln that burns
listed hazardous wastes itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The indirect
foodchain risks potentially identified in this Report, however, are not associated only with CKD generated by hazardous
waste burning kilns. As a result, EPA is also considering regulatory mechanisms that would specifically address
these risks, including promulgating regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD waste that would
provide adequate protection against these risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C) provides that EPA shall within six months of the RTC ``determine to promulgate regulations
under this subchapter *&blank;*&blank;* or determine that such regulations are unwarranted.'' The statute does
not describe the type of regulation that EPA should consider promulgating (if any), other than that such regulation
be under subtitle C of RCRA. For example, RCRA does not expressly direct EPA to determine whether to list CKD as hazardous,
as required for other wastes under the mandates in RCRA section 3001(c). Furthermore, RCRA section 2002(a) gives
the Administrator the broad authority to ``prescribe *&blank;*&blank;* such regulations as are necessary to carry
out his functions under this chapter.'' The Agency believes it has the authority where appropriate to promulgate
Federally-enforceable regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD. EPA could explore mechanisms
for imposing regulatory standards for CKD, e.g., under grant of rulemaking authority under section 3001(b)(3)(C).
Alternatively, EPA could consider conditioning the CKD exemption from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR
261.4(b)(8)) on compliance with appropriate management standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA could promulgate minimally burdensome management standards for cement kiln dust that would adequately control
the indirect foodchain risks, such as: (1) Requiring that dust piles be kept covered to control fugitive emissions
and institute surface water runoff and erosion controls; (2) maintaining groundwater protection, perhaps by requiring
that CKD piles be maintained on a non-earthen base or by requiring a liner; and (3) establishing risk-based concentration
thresholds for all constituents of concern (including 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) for CKD used
as a direct soil amendment. Additional or alternative standards may be appropriate, and EPA welcomes comments and
suggestions on this aspect of its options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the five options being considered by the Agency, Options 3, 4 and 5 would provide more control through implementation
of the provisions of subtitle C. The principal difference between Options 3 and 4 is the timing of the implementation
of the regulatory controls. Option 3 provides industry additional time to implement waste minimization/pollution
prevention options and more protective CKD management standards. Option 4 would bring CKD under subtitle C regulatory
control more quickly. Removing the exemption also would impose regulatory equity between CKD generated from kilns
that burn RCRA hazardous waste and residues from other incinerators that burn RCRA hazardous waste that do not have
such an exemption. Option 5 would provide management standards to control all CKD, and would be targeted to specifically
address only those risks of potential concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency did not evaluate the risk from the land application of agricultural lime, so it cannot determine whether
there is an increase in incremental risk when CKD is substituted. In any event, CKD-sewage sludge derived fertilizers
and soil amendments are considered safe for such uses as fertilizer and pose minimal risk because these final products
are required to be tested to assure they comply with all provisions of 40 CFR part 503, which are fully protective of
human health and the environment. It should be noted that if the exemption is removed, fertilizer that is derived from
CKD generated from a kiln that burns listed hazardous waste is itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule
(40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)); the extent of regulation, however, is limited (see 40 CFR 266.20(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it should also be noted that under current rules, if CKD is recycled, the resulting clinker is not automatically
subject to the provisions of subtitle C. By removing the exemption, however, clinker may be affected by the derived-from
rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) if the kiln burns listed hazardous waste, thereby becoming a hazardous waste. The Agency
has not yet fully analyzed available data on trace constituents in clinker. Based on our understanding of current
data, however, the Agency does not believe that clinker produced from kilns that burn listed hazardous waste generally
poses a hazard to human health and the environment. The Agency is, therefore, considering crafting appropriate regulatory
language for clinker. The Agency, however, is interested in receiving comment on this issue.

Summary of Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed revisions (58 FR 54702) include the creation of Area Committees and Area Contingency Plans; a National
Response Unit to assist in coordinating spill removal resources, personnel, and equipment; and U.S. Coast Guard
District Response Groups to assist On-Scene Coordinators and maintain Coast Guard response equipment. In addition,
the NPRM includes criteria and procedures for responding to discharges that result in substantial threats to public
health or welfare; procedures and standards for preventing, mitigating, and removing worst case discharges; and
a new provision addressing spills of national significance. EPA also proposed to revise subpart J of the NCP, which
provides for a Product Schedule that lists dispersants, bioremediation agents, and other miscellaneous oil spill
control substances. The subpart J revisions would reflect new dispersant effectiveness testing and acceptability
criteria.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We propose to revise the definition of end-stage renal disease to reflect that more than one dialysis treatment is
required for there to be a ``regular course of dialysis'' and to require that generally accepted diagnostic criteria
and laboratory findings must form the basis of the physician's certification of end-stage renal disease. The purpose
of this proposed revision is to eliminate any misinterpretation of the definition of end-stage renal disease. We
propose to do so by clarifying that only those individuals whose kidneys have failed and for whom the disease is expected
to be a lifelong affliction are eligible for Medicare end-stage renal disease benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also propose to amend the regulations to specify that Medicare entitlement is resumed for individuals who again
begin a regular course of renal dialysis treatments after a previous course is terminated (with or without a transplant),
and to add the same considerations for those who have a second transplant. Therefore, the purpose of these proposed
revisions is to conform the regulations more closely to the intent of sections 226A (c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Social
Security Act regarding resumption of entitlement to Medicare.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a disease which occurs from the destruction of normal kidney tissues over a long
period of time. The individual often does not experience any symptoms until the kidney has lost more than half of its
function. The loss of kidney function in ESRD is usually irreversible and permanent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Related Law and Regulations for Medicare Coverage of ESRD and the Definition of ESRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 226A(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides for Medicare coverage for certain individuals who
are medically determined to have end-stage renal disease. Once an individual is medically determined to have ESRD,
section 226A(b) of the Act specifies that one of two conditions must be met before entitlement begins. That is, a regular
course of dialysis must begin or a kidney transplant must be performed. Section 226A(b)(1)(A) of the Act provides
that entitlement begins with the third month after the month in which a regular course of renal dialysis is initiated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not give a definition of ESRD; however, the Medicare regulations in title 42 of the Code of Federal
Regulations do define the term. The definition of ESRD is given in two sections of the regulations. For purposes of
Medicare eligibility and entitlement, ESRD is currently defined in &sect;406.13(b) as that stage of kidney impairment
that appears irreversible and permanent and requires a regular course of dialysis or kidney transplantation to maintain
life. A parallel definition of ESRD also appears in &sect;405.2102 which defines ESRD as it relates to the conditions
for coverage that must be met by suppliers furnishing ESRD care to Medicare beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Potential Misinterpretation of the Current ESRD Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calendar year 1989, 21,200 individuals were certified by their physicians as having an irreversible, permanent
kidney impairment and obtained Medicare entitlement solely because of this certification. That is, they could not
qualify for Medicare on any other basis, such as age or disability status. In calendar year 1990, the number of similar
new beneficiaries was 22,800. Soon after obtaining Medicare eligibility, nearly 1 percent of these individuals
terminated their course of dialysis with a return of kidney function. We are concerned that the diagnosis and certification
of ESRD for these individuals was incorrect. The regulations in &sect;&sect;405.2102 and 406.13(b) define ESRD
as a condition that appears irreversible and permanent; Medicare entitlement on the basis of the patient's need for
dialysis is usually terminated only if the individual dies or receives a kidney transplant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any severe kidney condition (particularly acute kidney failure) may appear to be irreversible and permanent if the
diagnosis is based on only limited tests and criteria. We believe that certifications for the patients who terminated
dialysis may have arisen from a misunderstanding of the extent of the kidney failure which constitutes ESRD for which
the law grants Medicare entitlement. We believe that specifying that the diagnosis must be based on generally accepted
diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings may result in not enrolling in Medicare those patients whose renal disease
is not ``end-stage''. However, we do not wish to eliminate the word, ``appears,'' from the regulation since the law
recognizes that dialysis treatments may end in some ESRD cases.

C. Related Laws and Regulations for Termination of Medicare Entitlement and Resumption of Entitlement to ESRD Benefits

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 226A(b)(2) of the Act specifies that Medicare entitlement for individuals on the basis of ESRD terminates
with the end of the 36th month after the month of transplant or with the end of the 12th month after the last month of renal
dialysis treatments. Section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act specifically provides for beginning a new period of
entitlement when a kidney transplant fails or a course of renal dialysis begins again, whether during or after the
36 or 12 months, as applicable. Current regulations in &sect;406.13(f) address these situations by specifying that
entitlement does not end as scheduled if the treatment begins again during the applicable periods. The regulations
in &sect;406.13(g) deal with resumption of entitlement after termination of entitlement has occurred and require
the submission of a new application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the provisions in section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act ensure that resumption of entitlement to Medicare
will begin without the 3-month waiting period that usually applies in cases when Medicare entitlement is sought on
the basis of dialysis (except for certain cases involving self-care training).

II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Proposed Revision to ESRD Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We analyzed the payment records of patients who terminated dialysis shortly after becoming eligible for Medicare
based on a diagnosis of ESRD. Our records indicate an annual mean cost per patient of approximately $8,000, which is
significantly below the average annual cost of $40,000 for a patient who remains on dialysis. Because these individuals
were able to discontinue dialysis shortly after beginning a course of treatment and incurred only limited medical
costs, we believe that many of these patients may have been incorrectly certified as having ESRD as a result of physicians
misinterpreting the ESRD definition as it appears in &sect;406.13(b). We also find the current ESRD definition (&sect;406.13(b))
inadequate for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) eligibility and entitlement purposes because entitlement
to Medicare based on ESRD depends on the existence of ESRD, not on the sole fact that dialysis treatments are being given.
Therefore, in order to eliminate any possible misinterpretation, we propose to revise the definition of ESRD in &sect;406.13(b).
After the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* a regular course of dialysis'', we propose to add the word ``treatments''.
This revision would clarify that more than one dialysis treatment is required for there to be a regular course of dialysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to add to the end of the definition of ESRD, the phrase ``as evidenced by generally accepted diagnostic
criteria and laboratory findings''. We believe that requiring generally accepted diagnostic criteria and laboratory
findings as the basis for diagnosis of ESRD serves as a reminder to physicians that they must have medical evidence
to substantiate their certification of ESRD. We do not believe this addition to the definition would have a substantial
effect on most physicians since they already depend on such medical information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe it is necessary to add the word ``treatments'' or the phrase ``as evidenced by generally accepted
diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings'' to the definition of ESRD in &sect;405.2102, which defines ESRD as
it relates to the conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services. This is because that section does not establish
who is eligible or entitled to Medicare ESRD benefits, which is the purpose of this proposed rule.

B. Proposed Revisions to the Termination of Entitlement and to the Resumption of Entitlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act specifies the conditions for beginning a new period of entitlement when a
kidney transplant fails or a regular course of dialysis begins again. However, this section refers to those instances
when entitlement has not yet ended and specifies that Part A entitlement ``begins'' (although it may not yet have ended)
with the month when regular dialysis treatments begin again. The importance of ``beginning'' Part A entitlement
is that it offers the opportunity for those who do not have Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) entitlement to
enroll in Part B without waiting for the annual general enrollment period (January through March). Supplementary
Medical Insurance is a voluntary program available to most individuals age 65 or over and to disabled individuals
who are under age 65 and entitled to Medicare Part A. In addition, since Part A entitlement has not ended, we believe
that the intention is to re-enroll the individual in Part A with that month, without a new application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we propose to treat the situation where dialysis or transplant recurs during the 12-month or 36-month
periods as a resumption of entitlement. Accordingly, we delete from &sect;406.13(f) the reference to continuation
of entitlement, and instead revise &sect;406.13(g), which specifies the conditions for resumption of entitlement,
to include this situation where coverage resumes despite a previous course of treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to revise &sect;406.13(g) to state that entitlement would be resumed under any one of three conditions.
Using the language we propose to remove from paragraph (f), a new period of entitlement would begin if an individual
initiates a regular course of renal dialysis during the 12-month period after the previous course of dialysis ended,
and he or she would be entitled to resume Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B benefits effective with the
month the regular course of dialysis is resumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not mention the beginning of a new period of entitlement when a second kidney transplant occurs during
the 36-month period following the initial transplant, since there is never a waiting period for entitlement based
on a transplant. However, we believe that, by analogy, the provisions for beginning a new period of entitlement in
cases where a regular course of dialysis begins or recurs during the 36 months indicate that we should construe the
law as requiring resumption of entitlement and a new period of Part B enrollment in cases of re-transplantation that
occur without the beneficiary's resuming (or initiating) dialysis treatments. We, therefore, propose to revise
&sect;406.13(g) to state that entitlement would begin when an individual initiates a new, regular course of renal
dialysis, or has a kidney transplant, during the 36-month period after an earlier kidney transplant, and that he or
she would be entitled to resume Part A benefits and eligible to enroll in Part B benefits effective with the month the
regular course of dialysis begins or with the month the subsequent kidney transplant occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to make technical revisions to &sect;406.13(g) to clarify the other condition for resumption of entitlement.
That is, entitlement is resumed if an individual initiates a regular course of renal dialysis more than 12 months after
the previous regular course of dialysis ended or more than 36 months after the month of a kidney transplant, and the
individual is eligible to enroll in Part A and Part B benefits effective with the month in which the regular course of
dialysis treatment is resumed. If he or she is otherwise entitled to Part A benefits under the conditions specified
in &sect;406.13(c), and files an application, entitlement would begin with the month in which dialysis treatments
are initiated or resumed, without a waiting period, subject to the basic limitations of entitlement in &sect;406.13(e)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised definition of ESRD in &sect;406.13(b) and revisions to resumption of entitlement in &sect;406.13(g)
would also be used as the basis for eligibility for Medicare Part B. This is because, in accordance with &sect;407.10(a)(1),
an individual who qualifies for Medicare Part A on the basis of ESRD is also eligible for Medicare Part B.

When we publish these proposed requirements as a final rule, the Social Security Program Operations Manual System,
Part 6, ``HI''; the Medicare Part A Intermediary Manual, Part 3, ``Claims Processing''; the Medicare Part B Carriers
Manual, Part 3, ``Claims Processing''; and the Medicare Renal Dialysis Facilities Manual, would be revised to reflect
the changes made to the definition of ESRD and the resumption of entitlement.

V. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calendar year 1989, over 21,200 individuals were certified by their physicians as having an irreversible, permanent
kidney impairment, and obtained Medicare entitlement solely on the basis of this certification. In 1990, that number
was 22,800. As reported in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease's U.S. Renal Data System
Annual Data Report, approximately 1 percent of individuals receiving dialysis treatments during these years were
able to terminate their course of dialysis treatment because kidney function returned. This figure is consistent
with data that we maintain on the number of individuals whose Medicare eligibility terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We analyzed the Medicare payment records of beneficiaries whose sole reason for Medicare entitlement was ESRD, and
who discontinued dialysis (and thus, Medicare eligibility) within 2 years after enrollment. Our records indicate
that 70 percent of the individuals incurred annual costs of less than $10,000, with an annual mean cost per beneficiary
to the Medicare program of approximately $8,000. This is significantly below the average annual cost to the Medicare
program of $40,000 for a patient receiving regular dialysis treatments. Because these beneficiaries were able to
discontinue dialysis after incurring only limited medical costs, we believe that most of these patients may have
been incorrectly certified as having ESRD, which requires long-term maintenance dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Although the number of individuals who may have been incorrectly certified was less than 250 per year, they accounted
for nearly $2 million in annual Medicare program expenditures. These expenditures were unintended because the disease
did not reach ``end-stage'' in these individuals. As a result of this proposed revision, we estimate the projected
savings to the Medicare program for the next 5 calendar years to be as follows:

With regard to the portion of this proposed rule concerning resumption or continuation of entitlement after a terminating
event, we have no reason to believe, based on 13 years' experience, that more than one or two people would have had their
entitlement resumed earlier under the proposed revised regulation relating to that issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all physicians and dialysis
facilities to be small entities.

Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additional time burden or monetary requirements would be placed on physicians or dialysis facilities in order
to comply with the provisions of this proposed rule since physicians should already have appropriate laboratory
findings and generally accepted diagnostic criteria to confirm a diagnosis of ESRD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, changes in the resumption of entitlement regulations would have no effect on physicians or on dialysis
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result
in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or on the operations of a substantial number
of small rural hospitals. We are, therefore, not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise Onshore Oil and Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order No. 5 under 43 CFR 3164.1, originally issued February 24, 1989 (54 FR 8100), and made effective March 27, 1989,
for new facilities, August 23, 1989, for existing facilities measuring 200 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) or more per day
of gas, and February 26, 1990, for existing facilities producing less than 200 Mcf per day of gas. This proposed revision
would reorganize the Order to make it more logical in sequence, remove unnecessary provisions, resolve internal
inconsistencies discovered in the Order, and clarify certain provisions. These changes are based on several years
of experience implementing the Order, and on suggestions from the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Order No. 5, Measurement of Gas, implements and supplements requirements found in 43 CFR Part 3160 relating to the
measurement of gas produced under the terms of Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases, as well as gas produced
from State or privately owned lands when Federal and/or Indian leases receive a share of such production under the
terms of an approved agreement. The Order addresses gas measurement by orifice meter and gas measurement by other
methods acceptable to the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Gas measurement by electronic
flow computers, utilizing an orifice, which calculate volume using the equations specified by the American Gas Association
(AGA) Committee Report No. 3, may be implemented without prior approval if the minimum standards outlined in the Order
are adhered to.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several years of experience implementing the Order have revealed some areas where the organization of the Order can
be improved, and certain provisions that require amendment or clarification or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statement of the purpose of the Order in section I.B. is proposed to be amended to remove the reference to the assessments
and penalties imposed as a result of noncompliance or the failure to correct noncompliance, because the Order does
not set forth such assessments and penalties. The purpose statement also is proposed to be amended to include the purpose
that measurements be accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no amendments proposed in the definitions included in the existing Order. However, one new definition (meter
uncertainty) would be added in this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section III.A. on Required Recordkeeping is proposed to be amended by adding requirements for the retention of data
generated by electronic flow computers. The revised Order would set forth specifically the kinds of data required
to be retained, without prescribing an exhaustive list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article III. would be reorganized in the proposed Order. Two new sections would be added to cover minimum standards
specific to the secondary element of the orifice meter and to allow the use of other types of secondary elements, and
to cover other requirements not specific to orifice meters or the secondary element. Requirements included in section
C. on orifice meters are proposed to be moved, and in some cases amended, as part of the new section D. on secondary elements
or section E. on other requirements, and several new requirements have been added as part of section C. and new section
D. These changes are stated in table form below.

The automatic exemption from some requirements for meters measuring 100 Mcf per day or less on a monthly basis would
be expanded to include 3 additional standards. These added exemptions would include the existing requirement that
the static element be sized to make the pen that records the static pressure operate in the outer 2/3 of the chart range
for the majority of the flowing period, the new requirement that electronic flow computers be installed, operated,
and maintained to achieve an overall meter uncertainty of plus or minus 3 percent, and the new requirement for inspecting
meter tubes every 5 years. Language has been added to the Order identifying the applicable standards for the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following requirements proposed to be amended in revised Order No. 5 are discussed below in the order they appear
in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.5. (formerly C.8.) is proposed to be amended purely for clarification. It is the difference between the internal
diameters of the meter tube pipe and the orifice fittings that is to be within AGA tolerance limits, not the diameters
themselves, as the existing Order seems to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.6. (new) is added to ensure that the meter tubes conform with AGA Committee Report No. 3. Proper meter tube condition
is essential for accurate measurement. It is intended that all meter tube inspections would be conducted within the
first 5 years after the effective date of the final rule, and every 5 years thereafter. Meters measuring 100 Mcf per
day or less on a monthly basis would be exempt from this new requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.8. (formerly C.10.) is proposed to be amended for precision in stating the requirement. As stated in this rule,
orifice plates would be required to be inspected during calibration of the secondary element.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
III.C.10. (formerly C.12.) is proposed to be amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the requirement that, when leaks are detected, the meter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting shall be determined and recorded ``as found,'' and ``as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left'' after the meter is calibrated. This part of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is duplicated by the linearity test in requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.3. of the proposed Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.13. in the existing Order would be removed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Order because it is duplicated by the linearity test in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement III.D.3. of the proposed Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.C.11. (formerly C.21.) would be amended by revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action to provide for the submittal of a report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLM. The form called for in existing requirement C.21. is now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Minerals Management Service, not to the BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the operator would be required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a report to the BLM showing what corrections were made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.1. (formerly C.7.) would be amended by removing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision allowing consideration of a variance for sales or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation meters measuring between 200 and 500 Mcf per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision duplicates the general provision for a variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Article IV. of the Order. The requirement for the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an indicating thermometer would be removed because when using an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating thermometer the temperature is not a true average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flowing temperature. All meters measuring more than 100 Mcf per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day are required to have a temperature recorder. Meters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring 100 Mcf per day or less are required to use either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recorder or an average flowing temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.2. (new) would ensure that the accuracy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recording device is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.3. (formerly C.15.) would be amended for clarification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to require the recording of readings before and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments are made. The words ``of the element range'' would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to make it clear what the 0 and 100 percent refer to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.4. (new) would be added to require calibration equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be more accurate than the equipment being calibrated. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing equipment is not more accurate than the equipment being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrated, the inherent uncertainty in the metering equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.5. (new) would be added to require documentation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification or recertification of calibration equipment to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the authorized officer at the time of calibration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.6. (formerly C.17.) would be amended to allow meters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measure 100 Mcf or less per day to be inspected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrated semiannually rather than quarterly. Experience has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown that quarterly inspections and calibrations of meters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring such low volumes are neither cost effective nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to assure an acceptable degree of accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.7. (formerly C.18.) would be amended to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators to notify the authorized officer of the BLM well in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance of calibrations to enable the planning of inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.8. (formerly C.19.) would be amended by changing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to ``measuring equipment'' to ``recording device'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform with changes in other requirements. The current Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that an adjustment be made whenever a volume error of 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or greater occurs. It is proposed to change this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to ``more than 1 percent'' because volume errors of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 2 percent on higher volume wells are very significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in most instances, it will be the policy of the BLM not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pursue volume errors of less than 200 Mcf per month, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost of doing so would exceed the value of any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royalty that might result. The requirement that the meter be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted to zero error would be removed because this is part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the linearity test requirement in Section III.D.3. For the sake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of simplicity, the abatement period would be stated as 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only rather than also stating the alternative ``prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of calibration.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.10. would be added combining several requirements from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing Order, as explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.10.a. (formerly C.4.) would be revised to clarify what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is meant by the outer 2/3 of the chart range. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to sizing the orifice would be removed because doing so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not the only alternative available to the operator to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the differential pen in the outer 2/3 of the chart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
III.D.10.b. (formerly C.5.) would be revised to clarify what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is meant by the outer 2/3 of the chart range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.10.c. (formerly C.14.) would be amended by revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action. It would no longer require recordation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``as found'' and ``as left'' readings, which are meaningless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.D.11.a., b., and c. (new) would be added as requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Electronic Flow Computers (EFCs). The requirements for EFCs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be no more stringent than those for chart recorders. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current static pressure, differential pressure, and temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be displayed on a continuous basis, and the EFC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to have a back-up power source capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining data collected for a minimum of 35 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III.E.3. and 4. (formerly C.25. and 26.) would be amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make them read as requirements rather than as descriptions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, as they appear to do in the existing Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other editorial changes have been proposed to correct errors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing Order and cross-references that must be changed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the proposed reorganization of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby determined that this proposed rule does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land Management has determined that this proposed rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 516 Departmental Manual (DM), Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the proposal would not significantly affect the 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant effect on the human environment and that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that it will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same reasons. The rule codifies industry standards that apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all entities in the industry, regardless of size. The Order would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not require a substantial amount of additional information or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring. Some additional equipment may be required in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, but the total cost of these changes would not approach the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold specified in the Executive Order. Costs to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not increase at all as a result of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department certifies that this proposed rule does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent a governmental action capable of interference with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutionally protected property rights. There would be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking of private property without due process. Failure to abate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations could result in assessments under the Mineral Leasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and/or penalties under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act, and possibly lease cancellation if the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continues, but not without due process. Therefore, as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the proposed rule would not cause a taking of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in section 1(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirement(s) contained in Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3160 that relate to this Order have been approved by the Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order is established pursuant to the authority granted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary of the Interior under various Federal and Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral leasing statutes and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act of 1982. This authority has been delegated to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Land Management and is implemented by the onshore oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas operating regulations contained in 43 CFR part 3160. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3164.1 thereof specifically authorizes the Director to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue Onshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessary to implement or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement the operating regulations and provides that all such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Orders shall be binding on the lessees and operators of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and restricted Indian oil and gas leases which have been, or may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hereafter, be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is found at: section 3162.4&hyph;1, Well records and reports; section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3162.4&hyph;2, Samples, tests, and surveys; section 3162.7&hyph;1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposition of production; section 3162.7&hyph;3, Measurement of gas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and subpart 3163, Noncompliance, Assessments, and Penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One purpose of this Order is to establish requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standards for the accurate measurement of gas by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods authorized in 43 CFR 3162.7&hyph;3, i.e., measurement by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orifice meter or other methods acceptable to the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer. Accurate gas measurement ensures that the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government, the general public, State Governments that share in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proceeds, and Indian mineral owners receive the royalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due, as specified in the governing oil and gas leases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another purpose of this Order is to establish abatement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods for corrective action when noncompliance with the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards is detected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Order also serves as notice to any party cited for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance that it may request from the authorized officer an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the abatement period for any violation, provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the request for extension is applied for and granted prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the expiration of the abatement period previously allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order is applicable to all Federal and Indian (except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Osage) oil and gas leases. In addition, this Order is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all wells and facilities on State or privately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owned mineral lands committed to a unit or communitization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement that affects Federal or Indian interests, notwithstanding any provision of a unit or communitization
agreement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contrary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Required Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The operator shall keep all test data, meter reports, charts/recordings, or other similar records for 6 years from
the date they were generated, unless the operator is notified that an audit or investigation involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such records has been initiated. If the operator is notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an audit or investigation involving the records has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiated, the operator shall maintain the records until released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in writing from the obligation to maintain them. The authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may request, and the operator shall produce, such records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time within this period. For electronic flow computers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EFCs), this includes but is not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Field edits or volume adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Hourly average static and differential pressures, hourly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow temperatures, hourly sums of extensions calculated at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data point, hourly volumes, and the method used to obtain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summation of extensions, averages, and volumes. For the purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this Order, extensions are the square root of the product of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the differential pressure and static pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Subsequent edits or adjustments. If several changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made, only the original and the final readings shall be retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with any records submitted at the request of the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer, the operator shall provide all additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to compute volumes so that computations may be verified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All gas production shall be measured in accordance with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized method of measurement. As set out in 43 CFR 3162.7&hyph;3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas measurement authorized for gas produced from leases, unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, and communitization agreements subject to the jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bureau of Land Management, as such jurisdiction is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 43 CFR 3161.1, may be by orifice meter or other methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the authorized officer. The requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standards for gas measurement are set out below. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements for the primary element and chart recorder are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met, a meter accuracy of plus or minus 3 percent will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attained. However, given the complex components and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sophistication of electronic flow computers (EFCs), no ``cook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
book'' method can be established. Therefore, an uncertainty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of plus or minus 3 percent would be included for EFCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of this Order are based on the standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications published by the American Gas Association (AGA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and officially designated as ANSI/API 2530 and AGA Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report No. 3, second edition, 1985, hereafter referred to as AGA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee Report No. 3. The AGA-published standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications are considered to be appropriate for proper gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement by both the Department of the Interior and the oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas industry. The requirements set minimum standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to promote conservation of natural resources and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure proper measurement of gas production for sales and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation purposes, so that the Federal Government and Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral owners will receive the royalties due under governing oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas leases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All future sales and allocation facilities and sales or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation facilities in existence on the effective date of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order, unless covered by a valid variance, shall meet the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards prescribed in this Order; provided, however, that all gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced from or allocated to Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas leases wherein the gas is measured through sales or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation meters handling 100 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less on a monthly basis are exempt from the standards in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. C.1., C.2., D.10.a., D.10.b., and D.11.c. of this Order. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized officer may, where appropriate and necessary for proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement, work with the operators in designating consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas sales and/or allocation meter stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meter installations constructed in accordance with the AGA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee Report No. 3 standards in effect at that time shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically be required to retrofit if the standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised. The Bureau will review any revised standards and, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, will amend the Order through the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of these minimum standards is to ensure that when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment malfunctions occur that could result in inaccurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement, proper corrective actions are taken, the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer is notified, and a report is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to comply with these minimum standards will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered noncompliance and an incident of noncompliance (INC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be issued. Operators who discover noncompliance with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standards and take immediate corrective action will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued an INC. If the authorized officer or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative is present when an operator discovers a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
malfunction or uses incorrect procedures as specified in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order, an INC will be issued unless immediate corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is taken. Failure of equipment will not be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation. However, the incidents of noncompliance which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from equipment failure are considered violations. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partial list of such incidents follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to install equipment properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to repair or correct equipment malfunction properly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to submit report of alternate method of sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to submit required reports in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to adhere to the minimum standard procedures specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of improper equipment, when discovered, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a violation and a formal INC will be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of improper procedures will be considered a violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and when witnessed by the authorized officer or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative, immediate corrective action will be required. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event that proper procedures are then used as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Order, and prior to completing the operation, calibration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or proving, the violation will be considered as properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected. In this case, although the violation will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented in the agency files, no INC will be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure to take timely corrective action as required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet any standard in this article will be considered either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major or minor violation in accordance with the classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set out below for each standard, unless an applicable variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been granted or the standards have been otherwise modified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Article IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major violation, as defined in this Order, will generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an immediate shut-in of the metering device. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the non-recoupable loss is not significant or where damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the resource is likely to occur if a shut-in is required, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abatement period of 24 hours may be granted by the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer or his representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where abatement is required ``prior to sales or removal,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is required to be taken so that no gas can be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the measurement point until properly measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are minimum standards for the measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural gas using orifice meters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. For meters measuring more than 100 Mcf per day on a monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, the orifice to pipe diameter ratio (d/D), or the beta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio, with meters using ``flange taps,'' shall be between 0.15 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.70.

IV. Variances From Minimum Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An operator may request that the authorized officer approve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance from any of the minimum standards prescribed in Article 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. All such requests shall be submitted in writing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate authorized officer and shall provide information as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the circumstances warranting approval of the variance(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested and the proposed alternative means by which the related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard(s) will be satisfied. The authorized officer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after considering all relevant factors, shall approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested variance(s) if it is determined that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative(s) meets or exceeds the objectives of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard(s), or does not adversely affect royalty income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or production accountability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, approval may be given orally by the authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer before the operator initiates actions which require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance from minimum standards. The oral request, if granted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be followed by a written request not later than the fifth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business day following oral approval, and written approval will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authorized officer may also issue NTLs that establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified standards and requirements for specific geographic areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After notice to the operator, the authorized officer may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require compliance with standards that exceed those contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Order whenever such additional requirements are necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve protection of royalty income or production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability. The rationale for any such additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements shall be documented in writing to the operator.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is considering whether to undertake rulemaking to develop standards for vessel rebuild determinations.
In order to help it determine whether rulemaking is needed and the scope of the issues involved, the Coast Guard conducted
a public meeting on November 16, 1993. At the meeting, attendees discussed problems encountered under existing procedures
and possible solutions, and whether use of a negotiated rulemaking would be appropriate. The meeting attendees requested
that the Coast Guard conduct a second meeting to further discuss the issues. This notice announces the date, time,
and place of the second meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. app. 883), a vessel entitled to engage in the coastwise
trade by virtue of having been built in the United States which is later rebuilt outside the United States, loses its
eligibility to engage in the coastwise trade. Under 46 U.S.C. 12106, a vessel not eligible for the coastwise trade
cannot receive a Great Lakes endorsement on its Certificate of Documentation. In addition, under 46 U.S.C. 12108,
a fishing vessel which has been rebuilt outside the United States and which does not qualify for the rebuild savings
provision of the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987, is not eligible for a fishery endorsement
on its Certificate of Documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective January 1, 1994, the Coast Guard's regulatory standard for rebuild determinations will be found in 46 CFR
&sect;67.177. (See final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 issue of Monday, November 15, 1993, page 60256.) In accordance with that standard, a vessel is rebuilt when ``any considerable
part of its hull or superstructure is built upon or is substantially altered.'' A determination that a vessel has been
rebuilt, if the rebuilding was done outside the U.S., results in a permanent loss of the eligibility of the vessel to
engage in the restricted trades, with a commensurate loss in value. At the present time none of the problematic terms
contained in the regulatory standard are defined. As a result, the Coast Guard frequently receives requests for advisory
opinions that certain work to be performed on a vessel does not constitute a rebuilding. In support of a request for
a rebuild determination, the submitter will generally enclose extensive documentation addressing the character
and scope of the work to be performed including plans, drawings, contracts, work orders, and materials lists. Then
the submitter will attempt to show that the work will not build upon or ``substantially'' alter ``any considerable
part'' of the vessel's hull or superstructure. Often, the submitter will make comparisons between the before and
after area of the hull and superstructure; the weight and area of steel plate to be replaced or added; or the comparative
cost of the planned work to the value of the vessel. Unfortunately, the vessel representative sometimes does not submit
any documentation until after the work is performed only to have the Coast Guard determine that the vessel has been
rebuilt, with the disastrous consequence of loss of trading entitlements. In other cases, the work actually done
on the vessel differs from or exceeds the planned work, with possible adverse effects on the final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard is considering initiating rulemaking to develop standards for determining when work on a vessel constitutes
a rebuilding and to define the terms involved in rebuild determinations. However, to assist it to determine the scope
of the issues involved in the project and to receive suggested definitions and standards for consideration, the Coast
Guard conducted a public meeting before proceeding with the rulemaking process. At the meeting held on November 16,
1993, the attendees requested time to consider the information and ideas shared at the meeting and the opportunity
to submit written materials to the Coast Guard. In addition, the attendees requested that the Coast Guard schedule
a second meeting to further discuss the issues involved, including whether the use of negotiated rulemaking would
be appropriate. The Coast Guard agreed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to have sufficient time to review written submissions prior to the meeting, all materials should be received
by the Coast Guard on or before January 31, 1994. Attendees are encouraged to share written submissions with other
attendees. An attendance list with addresses for this purpose may be obtained by contacting the person identified

1. This action extends the deadline for filing reply comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;254,
8 FCC Rcd 7277 (1993), in which the Commission seeks comment on whether the public interest would be served by establishing
limits on the amount of commercial matter broadcast by television stations. The Commission adopted the Notice on
its own motion. Comments were due by December 20, 1993, and the deadline for reply comments was January 5, 1994.

2. The Center for the Study of Commercialism, the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federation of America,
and the Office of Communication of the United Church for Christ (the parties) request a 30-day extension of the reply
comment period in order to address adequately the matters asserted in the comments. The parties state that the reply
comment period extends over the seasonal holidays, providing insufficient time in which to prepare an adequate reply.
In addition, they state that their co-counsel, a clinical legal education program at a local law school, lacks the
staff to prepare reply comments during the school holiday.

The parties also state that an extension will allow the Commission to supplement the Notice. Specifically, they request
that two pending petitions for rulemaking, both of which concern the Commission's rules on commercial sponsorship
identification, be incorporated into this proceeding. However, we believe that the issues raised in the petitions
for rulemaking are best addressed separately by the Commission. Accordingly, we decline to extend the range of issues
addressed in this proceeding.

3. In light of the foregoing, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for an extension. Grant of the request will provide
the Commission a more substantial record upon which to base its findings. Therefore, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.283, the
deadline for filing reply comments is extended until February 4, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 3, 1991, the Regional Administrator for Region IX of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disapproved
certain water quality criteria contained in the Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta Estuary, that was adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board on May 1, 1991. These
criteria were disapproved because they failed to protect the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife
uses of the estuary. Under the authority of section 303 of the Clean Water Act, this document proposes a rule establishing
three sets of federal criteria to protect the designated uses of the estuary: salinity criteria protecting the Estuarine
Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses, a second set of salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity)
to protect the Fish Spawning (Striped Bass) designated use in the lower San Joaquin River, and a set of salmon smolt
survival index criteria to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the estuary.

 Section 303 of the Clean Water Act, as amended (hereinafter CWA or the Act), requires each state to adopt water quality
standards consisting of designated uses and instream water quality criteria to protect such uses for all waters of
the United States located within that state. Section 303(c) of the Act provides that states shall review and, if appropriate,
revise the water quality standards at least once every three years. Any new or revised standards adopted by the state
are to be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency). In
the event that EPA disapproves a state's standards, and the state does not make EPA's requested changes within ninety
(90) days of the disapproval, or if EPA determines at any time that revised or new standards are necessary to meet the
requirements of the Act, section 303(c)(4) of the Act states that the Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish
proposed regulations establishing water quality standards for the applicable waterbodies. The Administrator
shall promulgate any new or revised standards not later than ninety (90) days after publication of the proposed standards.
EPA's regulations for implementing section 303(c) of the Act are codified at 40 CFR part 131. Guidance for implementing
these regulations is contained in the Water Quality Standards Handbook (December 1983) and Technical Support Manual:
Waterbody Surveys and Assessments for Conducting Use Attainability Analyses (Volumes I, II and III).

EPA's proposal is part of a coordinated federal interagency response to the water management issues in the San Francisco
Bay and Delta. EPA has worked closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS), and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented approach
to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California. Other components of this interagency initiative
are being announced contemporaneously with EPA's proposal. These include USFWS actions on petitions to list the
longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail as endangered fish species under the Federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.
&sect;&sect;1531 to 1540 (ESA), the USFWS proposal of critical habitat for the Delta smelt under the ESA, and the NMFS
reclassification of the winter-run Chinook salmon as endangered under the ESA.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta estuary (hereinafter the Bay/Delta) is the West Coast's
largest estuary. It encompasses roughly 1600 square miles, and drains over 40 percent of California. The Bay/Delta
is the point of convergence of California's two major river systems_the Sacramento River system flowing southward
and draining a large part of northern California, and the San Joaquin River system flowing northward and draining
a large part of central California. These two rivers, together with a number of smaller rivers flowing directly westward
from the mountains, come together in a network of channels and islands, roughly a triangle 90 miles on each side, known
as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The rivers converge at the western tip of the Delta, forming an estuary as fresh
water mixes with marine water through a series of bays, channels, shoals and marshes and ultimately flowing into San
Francisco Bay and then to the Pacific Ocean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bay/Delta constitutes one of the largest systems for fish production in the country, supplying habitat for over
120 fish species. It also comprises one of the largest areas of waterfowl habitat in the United States, providing a
stopover for more than one-half of the waterfowl and shorebirds migrating on the Pacific Flyway. Within the boundaries
of the Bay/Delta is the Suisun Marsh, the largest brackish marsh on the West Coast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bay/Delta is also the hub of California's two major water distribution systems_the Central Valley Project (CVP)
built and operated by the USBR and the State of California's State Water Project (SWP). Most of the State's developed
water_75 to 85 percent_is used for irrigation purposes by agriculture, irrigating over 4.5 million acres throughout
the State. The Bay/Delta watershed also provides part or all of the drinking water supply for over 18 million people.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Located solely within the State of California, the Bay/Delta is subject under state law to the water quality control
jurisdiction of the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) and two regional boards, the Central
Valley and San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Under the California regulatory scheme, the State
Board's actions preempt regional board actions to the extent of any conflicts. Cal. Water Code &sect;13170. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1978, the State Board adopted and submitted to EPA a Water Quality Control Plan (hereinafter the 1978 Delta Plan)
containing a comprehensive set of water quality standards to protect the designated uses of the Bay/Delta. The 1978
Delta Plan included water quality standards for three categories of designated uses: municipal and industrial,
agriculture, and fish and wildlife.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1978 Delta Plan relied on a key set of criteria to protect fish and wildlife uses: the striped bass spawning and survival
criteria. These criteria were established to provide minimum salinity and flow conditions to protect the fishery
at levels that would have existed in the absence of the State and federal water projects (the so-called ``without projects''
level). The striped bass survival criteria were based on a statistical correlation between a Striped Bass Index (SBI)
(a measure of the relative abundance of young striped bass in the estuary) and two hydrological variables: (1) Delta
outflow (freshwater flowing through the Delta out to the ocean), and (2) Delta diversions (freshwater diverted out
of the Delta channels for consumptive uses in agricultural irrigation, municipal and industrial uses). Based on
this relationship, flow (measured in cubic feet per second (cfs) of Delta outflow) and salinity requirements at critical
points in the Bay/Delta were adopted as criteria. The SBI, although not a formal criteria, was used to measure and predict
the substantive environmental results of implementing these flow and salinity criteria. The 1978 Delta Plan emphasized
striped bass protection because of the economic importance and availability of scientific information on this species
in the Bay/Delta, but the Plan also indicated that it considered the striped bass standards to be a surrogate for protection
of other species.

The CWA and implementing regulations describe the two components of water quality standards as ``designated uses''
and ``water quality criteria'' (40 CFR 131.3(i)), whereas California uses the terms ``beneficial uses'' and ``objectives''.
It has been EPA's and California's longstanding practice to interpret these terms synonymously. To avoid confusion,
this proposal will use the federal terms ``designated uses'' and ``criteria''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to its obligations under section 303(c)(3) of the Act, EPA reviewed the 1978 Delta Plan in 1980. While EPA
approved the Plan, it was concerned that the 1978 Delta Plan standards would not provide adequate protection of striped
bass and the estuary's fishery resources. EPA therefore conditioned its approval upon a set of ``interpretations''
of the standards, including commitments by the State Board to review and revise the 1978 Delta Plan standards immediately
if there were measurable adverse impacts on striped bass spawning, or if necessary to attain ``without project''
levels of protection for the striped bass (as defined by an SBI value of 79). EPA also conditioned its approval on the
State Board's commitment to develop additional criteria to protect aquatic life and tidal wetlands in and surrounding
the Suisun Marsh. The State Board concurred with these interpretations in its letter to EPA dated November 21, 1980.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the years since the 1978 Delta Plan was adopted, these standards have not accomplished the intended goal of maintaining
the SBI at a long term average of 79, the 1978 Delta Plan's estimate of ``without project'' levels. Indeed, during the
1980's, the SBI averaged approximately 7.5, and in 1983 and 1985 reached all-time lows of 1.2 and 2.2. Some of the decline
in the SBI may be attributable to drought conditions in the late 1970's and again in the late 1980's. However, the highest
SBI values actually attained since the 1978 Delta Plan was adopted were only in the teens and 20's, a substantial shortfall
from the stated goal of 79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The precipitous decline in striped bass is indicative of the poor health of other aquatic resources in the estuary.
Several species have experienced similar declines, including chinook salmon (the winter-run of chinook salmon
is listed as a threatened species under the ESA, and is currently proposed for reclassification as endangered), Delta
smelt (recently listed as a threatened species under the ESA) and Sacramento splittail and longfin smelt (both the
subject of a recent petition for listing as endangered species). The California Department of Fish and Game (California
DFG) recently testified that virtually all of the estuary's major fish species are in clear decline. (CDFG 1992b,

As fishery resources continued to decline, EPA on several occasions expressed its concern to the State Board about
the need for standards to adequately protect these resources. Throughout the first and second triennial reviews
ending in 1981 and 1985, EPA urged the State Board to review and revise the 1978 Delta Plan in accordance with EPA's 1980
approval letter. At the conclusion of each triennial review, the State Board made no changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After its second triennial review, in a letter to EPA dated June 23, 1986, the State Board acknowledged that the 1978
Delta Plan standards were not adequate to protect the estuary's fishery resources. It then outlined the hearing process
it was planning for revising the standards. In response, and as part of its consideration of the State Board's second
triennial review, EPA, on June 29, 1987, sent a letter to the State Board stating that EPA could no longer approve the
striped bass survival standards (or the related provision allowing relaxation of the spawning standard in drier
years) because these standards did not adequately protect the designated uses. EPA recognized, however, that the
State Board had initiated new hearings to revise the 1978 Delta Plan standards. EPA therefore indicated that it would
await the results of the new hearings and approve or disapprove the revised standards after the State Board's submission
to EPA of a complete set of revised standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to EPA's review under the CWA, the 1978 Delta Plan also received intense scrutiny under state law in California
state court. This review culminated in a state appellate decision,

182 Cal. App. 2d 82 (1st Dist., 1986) (known as the ``Racanelli Decision'' after its author, Judge John T. Racanelli).
Among that decision's many holdings was the conclusion that the 1978 Delta Plan's water quality standards had been
impermissibly limited to those standards that could be enforced against only the SWP and CVP (instead of against all
water users). The court took notice that the State Board had proposed hearings to develop revisions to the 1978 Delta
Plan, and asked the State Board to remedy the Plan's shortcomings in those hearings.

Following the first phase of the new hearings, the State Board in November 1988 issued a draft Plan that included revised
salinity and flow standards to protect the fisheries and other designated uses. The State Board subsequently withdrew
that draft Plan, however, and issued a revised workplan that served as the basis for the State Board's present Water
Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (1991 Bay/Delta
Plan). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the revised workplan, the State Board, on May 1, 1991, adopted State Board Resolution No. 91&hyph;34,
formally approving the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. The Plan restated the specific designated uses that had been included
in the 1978 Delta Plan and related regional board basin plans. As restated, the designated uses included the following:
Agricultural Supply, Cold and Warm Fresh-Water Habitat, Estuarine Habitat, Fish Migration, Fish Spawning, Groundwater
Recharge, Industrial Process Supply, Industrial Service Supply, Municipal and Domestic Supply, Navigation, Contact
and Non-Contact Water Recreation, Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species,
Shellfish Harvesting, and Wildlife Habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan, which was submitted for EPA's review on May 29, 1991, amended certain salinity criteria and
adopted new temperature and dissolved oxygen criteria for specified locations in the estuary. The changes to the
criteria, however, were of minimal substance. The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan did not revise the earlier 1978 Delta Plan to
address EPA's longstanding concerns about adequate protection for the designated fish and wildlife uses of the Bay/Delta.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 3, 1991, EPA approved in part and disapproved in part the provisions of the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. EPA's
letter found that ``[t]he record *&blank;*&blank;* does not support the conclusion that the State has adopted criteria
sufficient to protect the designated uses'' of the estuary. The designated uses at risk, as defined by the State Board,
include Estuarine Habitat, and also Cold and Warm Water Habitat, Fish Migration, Fish Spawning, Ocean Commercial
and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, and Wildlife Habitat. In
addition to its general finding that the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan did not contain sufficient criteria to protect the designated
uses, EPA also disapproved the absence of salinity standards to protect fish and wildlife uses in the Suisun, San Pablo,
and San Francisco Bays and Suisun Marsh, the absence of scientifically supportable salinity standards (measured
by electrical conductivity) to protect the Fish Spawning uses of the lower San Joaquin River, and the absence of scientifically
supportable temperature standards on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers to protect the fall-run and winter-run
chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 303(c)(3) of the Act, the State Board had 90 days to make changes to the criteria disapproved by
EPA in its September 3, 1991 letter. The State Board made no such revisions during the 90 day period or at any subsequent
time. However, in the summer of 1992, the State Board, at the request of the Governor of the State of California, held
hearings for the purpose of establishing interim measures to protect the natural resources in the Bay/Delta estuary.
In keeping with the CWA's recognition that the states have primary responsibility for setting water quality standards,
EPA participated in these hearings_rather than proposing federal standards at that time_in the hope that the hearings
would result in state adoption of approvable standards and preclude the need for a federal rulemaking. EPA submitted
opening and closing statements to the State Board, and joined with NMFS and USFWS in submitting an Interagency Statement
of Principles. These statements recommended that the State Board adopt a habitat and ecosystem-based approach to
standards that would satisfy CWA requirements and meet the State Board's goal of reversing the decline of the estuary's
fish and wildlife resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

At the conclusion of these hearings, the State Board, on December 10, 1992, issued its recommended interim measures
in Draft Water Rights Decision (hereinafter D&hyph;1630). The Draft contained new water export limits and pumping
restrictions and ordered ``pulse flows'' to help transport young migratory fish through the Delta. It also imposed
water conservation measures on agricultural and urban users, and established a restoration fund financed by user
fees to pay for conservation efforts in the Bay/Delta. Although D&hyph;1630 proposed several changes in the operation
of the water facilities affecting the estuary that would be beneficial to its natural resources, EPA informed the
State Board in its comments dated January 13, 1993, that D&hyph;1630, if adopted, would not satisfy the requirements
of the Act. EPA noted that D&hyph;1630, a proposed water rights decision, did not purport to revise the State's water
quality standards at all, and therefore did not affect EPA's prior decision disapproving the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan.
Moreover, EPA noted that the measures in D&hyph;1630 were not tied to specific designated uses in the estuary (including
the Estuarine Habitat, Fish Spawning, and Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species uses), and that no attempt
had been made to assure that the designated uses would be protected. Accordingly, EPA found that D&hyph;1630 ``meets
neither the procedural nor the substantive requirements of the Clean Water Act.'' After the close of the comment period
for D&hyph;1630, the State Board, in response to a subsequent request by the Governor, declined to adopt D&hyph;1630.

In response to the State Board's failure to revise the criteria disapproved in EPA's September 3, 1991 letter, EPA,
pursuant to section 303 (c)(3) and (c)(4) of the Act, is proposing regulations establishing revised water quality
criteria which would in effect supersede and supplement the disapproved State criteria for purposes of the CWA.

B. Statutory Basis and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 303(c) of the Act requires that state water quality standards ``*&blank;*&blank;* be such as to protect the
public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of this Act. Such standards shall be established
taking into consideration their use and value for propagation of fish and wildlife. *&blank;*&blank;*'' Key concerns
of this statutory provision are the enhancement of water quality and the protection of the propagation of fish. The
ultimate purpose of water quality standards, as with the other sections of the Act, is to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. CWA section 101(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 303(c) of the Act, a water quality standard for a specific waterbody consists of two components: a designated
use for which a waterbody is to be protected (such as recreation, fish and wildlife, or agriculture) and a numerical
or qualitative water quality criterion which supports the designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act gives primary responsibility for the adoption of water quality standards to the states. After adopting its
initial water quality standards, a state is required, no less than every three years, to review those standards and,
if necessary, modify them. Under section 303(c)(1) of the Act, the results of these triennial reviews are to be submitted
to EPA for review and approval or disapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Water Quality Standards regulations at 40 CFR part 131 specify the requirements for water quality criteria.
States must adopt those water quality criteria that protect the designated use. Such criteria must be based on sound
scientific rationale and must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated use. For
waters with multiple use designations, the criteria shall support the most sensitive use. (see 40 CFR 131.11(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a state's criteria must be consistent with the state's antidegradation policy. The federal regulations
provide that, at a minimum, the state must maintain ``[e]xisting instream water uses [those existing in the waterbody
at any time on or after November 28, 1975] and the level of water quality necessary to protect the existing uses. *&blank;*&blank;*''
40 CFR 131.12(a)(1). In order to approve a state's water quality criteria, EPA must determine whether the state has
adopted ``water quality criteria [that are] sufficient to protect the designated uses.'' 40 CFR 131.6(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 303(c)(4) of the Act provides that the Administrator shall promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations
establishing a new or revised standard in either of two situations: First, when the Administrator has disapproved
a state standard under section 303(c)(3) and the state has not taken corrective action within 90 days; and, second,
in any case where the Administrator determines that a revised or new standard is necessary to meet the requirements
of the Act. Once promulgated, the federal regulations are applicable to the state's waters, and, if they are more stringent,
have the effect of supplanting and supplementing the state's standards. However, it is EPA's longstanding policy
that the federal regulations will be withdrawn if a state adopts and submits standards that in the Agency's judgment
meet the requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing California's implementation of its water quality standards program, EPA has considered the provisions
of section 101(g) of the Act, which restate the long-standing policy of Federal deference to state water allocation
functions: ``It is the policy of Congress that the authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its
jurisdiction shall not be superseded, abrogated or otherwise impaired by this [Act].'' The General Counsel of EPA,
in a Memorandum to Regional Administrators dated November 7, 1978, interpreted this statutory provision in the context
of the water quality standards program and concluded that ``EPA should therefore impose requirements which affect
water usage only where they are clearly necessary to meet the Act's requirements.'' See also Memorandum from Robert
M. Perry, General Counsel, to Frederic A. Eidsness, Jr., Assistant Administrator for Water, dated March 17, 1983
(considering interplay of section 101(g) and the guidelines under section 404(b)(1) of the Act). These positions
of the General Counsel are consistent with the existing judicial precedent interpreting section 101(g). The leading
case interpreting section 101(g) in light of the other mandates of the CWA,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the discussion above indicates, EPA has attempted to accommodate the State Board processes procedurally, generally
deferring to the State Board schedules for review and revision of its water quality standards, even though this State
process has continued for almost a decade and has frequently exceeded the Act's required triennial review requirements.
Similarly, EPA is in this proposal attempting to accommodate the State's interest substantively. Although the State
Board, in the 1978 Delta Plan, adopted explicit flow criteria, EPA is refraining from proposing direct revisions
to the flow criteria. Instead, EPA is proposing criteria that describe the habitat conditions necessary to protect
the designated uses of the Bay/Delta. The State Board still has full discretion to develop implementation measures
attaining those habitat conditions, and still retains full discretion over the allocation of water necessary to
achieve the criteria. Finally, EPA has fully considered the record developed in the State Board's 1992 hearings on
D&hyph;1630 and, to the extent possible, has incorporated the scientific information presented in those hearings
in the proposed criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Board's adoption of the 1978 Delta Plan, and of the revised Bay/Delta Plan in 1991, were intended to meet the
State's obligations to establish water quality standards under the CWA. Pursuant to its mandate under section 303(c)(3)
of the Act, on September 3, 1991, EPA disapproved several of the criteria contained in the State Board's plan. For the
reasons outlined herein and in EPA's letter of September 3, 1991, the Administrator finds that the water quality criteria
adopted by the State fail to protect the designated uses and the criteria proposed below would meet the requirements
of the Act. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 303(c)(3) and 303(c)(4) of the Act, the Administrator is proposing
the following water quality criteria applicable to California waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing three different sets of water quality criteria: Salinity criteria protecting estuarine habitat
in the Suisun Bay area, salmon smolt survival indices protecting salmon migration, and an electrical conductivity
criterion protecting striped bass spawning on the lower San Joaquin River. Each set of criteria is intended to protect
a particular designated use or set of uses in the Bay/Delta estuary. As discussed above, these designated uses were
originally established by the regional boards in the individual basin plans and by the State Board in its 1978 Delta
Plan, and were reaffirmed and restated in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. The discussion below describes each set of proposed
criteria in detail and outlines the scientific basis for the proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these proposed criteria, EPA has considered the scientific evidence and testimony presented during
the State Board's 1992 hearing process, as well as scientific information from other sources. In particular, EPA
has relied upon the recommendations of the USFWS, of Dr. Peter Moyle, Professor in the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries
Biology at the University of California at Davis and author of more than 100 articles and books on the ecology of the
inland fishes of California, and of a distinguished panel of scientists who participated in a series of workshops
sponsored by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed criteria are consistent with the Interagency Statement of Principles dated June 15, 1992 and submitted
to the State Board by EPA, USFWS, and NMFS during the Board's 1992 hearings. This Interagency Statement recommended
that the State Board develop a comprehensive habitat protection approach to restore and maintain the ecological
health of the estuary, and provided a framework for both interim and long-term standards. The Interagency Statement
also emphasized that there is a consensus among the three federal agencies that the existing scientific information
is sufficient to set criteria to protect the designated uses of the estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria proposed below are similar to those EPA has outlined in letters and statements to State and federal agencies,
including in the following: its September 3, 1991 disapproval letter to the State Board; its June 11, 1992 policy statement
and its August 24, 1992 closing statement submitted to the State Board's 1992 hearings; and its October 29, 1992 letter
to USFWS and NMFS. Throughout this process, EPA has carefully coordinated its actions and proposals with other State
and Federal environmental agencies to achieve a consensus on the water quality criteria necessary to protect the
estuary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan included ``Estuarine Habitat'' as a designated use for the Bay/Delta estuary. As
described more fully in the Water Quality Control Plan, San Francisco Bay Basin [2], December 1986, at II&hyph;4,
this Estuarine Habitat designated use is intended to provide ``an essential and unique habitat that serves to acclimate
anadromous fishes (salmon, striped bass) migrating into fresh or marine conditions. This habitat also provides
for the propagation and sustenance of a variety of fish and shellfish, numerous waterfowl and shore birds, and marine
mammals.'' Related fish and wildlife uses of the Bay/Delta estuary designated by the State Board include Ocean Commercial
and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, Fish Migration, and Wildlife
Habitat. To protect these designated uses, the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan included dissolved oxygen and temperature criteria
to protect chinook salmon, outflow and salinity criteria to protect striped bass, and salinity criteria to protect
the managed (non-tidal) areas of Suisun Marsh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the specific criteria adopted by the State Board clearly do not protect the integrity of the Estuarine
Habitat designated use. Although EPA had already many times noted the inadequacies of the 1978 Delta Plan, the 1991
Bay/Delta Plan made only minor adjustments to criteria protecting striped bass, salmon, and the managed portions
of the Suisun Marsh, and provided no criteria specifically addressing the Estuarine Habitat designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shortcomings of the State Board's criteria are reflected by the continued deterioration of the estuary's resources.
The SBI, used as a measure of the health of the 1978 Delta Plan's indicator species, has never attained its targeted
value of 79, and instead has plummeted to unprecedented low values. Recent testimony by the California DFG indicates
that virtually all of the estuary's major fish species are in clear decline (CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8).
As noted above in the recitation of the history of the Bay/Delta, many species relying on the estuarine habitat are
listed or are being considered for listing under the ESA. One recent report suggests that at least five of the estuary's
fish species (longfin smelt, spring-run Chinook salmon, Sacramento splittail, green sturgeon, and Red Hills roach)
qualify for immediate listing under the ESA (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992), in addition to the already listed winter-run
Chinook salmon and Delta smelt.

Gov. Wilson also outlined the kinds of measures necessary to protect the Bay/Delta: ``If we are to be good stewards
of our fish and wildlife, we must begin to mitigate these impacts by providing larger streamflows, greater Delta outflow,
restoration of spawning gravel and provision of fish screens and temperature control measures.'' In response to
Gov. Wilson's proposal, the State Board initiated the D&hyph;1630 process, the ``immediate goal'' of which was ``to
halt the decline and increase the protection of public trust resources where reasonable.'' (SWRCB 1992b). However,
as explained above, California abandoned the D&hyph;1630 process, and the State Board has yet to develop criteria
that adequately protect the Estuarine Habitat designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its disapproval letter of September 3, 1991, EPA formally found that the set of water quality criteria adopted by
the State Board in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan failed to protect the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife
uses of the estuary.

To be consistent with the Clean Water Act and the accompanying Regulations, the State's [criteria] must be sufficient
to protect Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses. The Estuarine Habitat use, which has been
formally approved by the State and EPA as part of the State's water quality standards, was established to provide ``an
essential and unique habitat that serves to acclimate anadromous fishes (salmon, striped bass) migrating into fresh

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the State Board's failure to address EPA's concerns either directly or in the D&hyph;1630 process, EPA is proposing
to supplement the State's criteria with additional salinity criteria to protect the Estuarine Habitat designated
use and related fish and wildlife uses of the estuary described above. EPA is emphasizing the Estuarine Habitat designated
use because of its importance to the whole spectrum of fish and wildlife uses in the estuary. This emphasis is consistent
with the Interagency Statement of Principles' recommendation that restoration efforts focus on habitat protection.
The discussion below describes the scientific basis for salinity criteria and presents EPA's conclusions as to this
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Developing Salinity Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing proposed criteria protecting Estuarine Habitat, EPA has considered the complex hydrological and
biological nature of the Bay/Delta estuarine system. Habitat conditions in the estuary change from month to month
and year to year primarily in response to precipitation upstream, reservoir operations, agricultural patterns
and export rates (Nichols et al. 1986). Many important environmental characteristics within the Delta and Bay respond
to changes in water availability, storage and use. The environmental characteristics of particular biological
importance include flow rates and volumes within river channels and the Bay, salinity and turbidity levels, water
temperature, and the degree of stratification of the water column. Correlations among all these variables are high;
thus, each is often a good indicator of the other. However, other factors such as wind, tidal stage, and antecedent
conditions influence the day to day values of each variable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When EPA disapproved the State's criteria on September 3, 1991, it suggested that the State could develop approvable
replacement criteria using a number of alternative methodologies: it could adopt additional salinity and temperature
criteria, adopt revised flow criteria, adopt biological criteria, or develop a combination of these or other scientifically-defensible
criteria protecting the designated Estuarine Habitat and fish and wildlife uses in the estuary. Upon the State's
failure to revise its criteria during the statutory 90 day period (or during the D&hyph;1630 process), EPA began developing
a federal proposal for criteria protecting the applicable designated uses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entrapment Zone
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The ``entrapment zone'' was the focus of EPA's initial consideration of water quality criteria due primarily to
its perceived importance to the food chain. The entrapment zone, where ocean water flowing landward at depth mixes
with freshwater flowing seaward at the surface (Kimmerer 1992), is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important
habitats within the estuary. Salinities are usually between 2 and 10 ppt, turbidity and phytoplankton densities
are high, and young fish of several species are most abundant in this zone. One of the most important aspects of the entrapment
zone is the localized high density of prey. The closest association of predator and prey with the entrapment zone is
shown by Delta smelt and its principal food item, the copepod 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eurytemora affinis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Moyle et al. 1992). Similarly, young striped bass and their principal food item, the shrimp 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neomysis affinis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, are found in the greatest abundance in salinities between 2 and 10 ppt. (Heubach 1969, Siegfried et al. 1979, Orsi
and Knutson 1979, Knutson and Orsi 1983, Orsi and Mecum 1986, Obrebski, et al. 1992). Many young fish require high food
densities in order to obtain sufficient food for growth (Moyle and Cech 1988), and it has been suggested that the density
of food in the entrapment zone may affect fish survival and abundance. However, no direct evidence of starvation has
been demonstrated for the declining fish populations of the estuary (Bennett et al. 1990, Moyle et al. 1992). The location
of the entrapment zone has also been shown to be important for organisms at lower trophic levels (that is, organisms
that are lower on the food chain). Phytoplankton densities are higher when the entrapment zone is within the relatively-shallow
Suisun Bay than when it is further upstream in deeper channels (Arthur and Ball 1980). Measurements of phytoplankton
growth rates show that shallow areas are ten times as productive as channel areas (Cloern et al. 1983).

In large part because of the relationship between fishery productivity and the entrapment zone described above,
EPA initially considered developing federal criteria designed to directly maintain and protect the entrapment
zone. However, as described below, discussions among the participants in a workshop convened by the SFEP suggested
that salinity criteria would be a more appropriate measure for protecting estuarine habitat.

San Francisco Estuary Project Workshop Findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SFEP is a five-year cooperative effort by over 100 representatives of public and private entities concerned about
the water quality and natural resources of the San Francisco Bay estuary. Funded primarily by EPA and the State of California,
the SFEP has developed a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan to protect the natural and consumptive water
uses of the Bay/Delta (SFEP 1993a). In 1991 and 1992, the SFEP convened a series of workshops to develop the scientific
rationale for an estuarine index that would measure the responses of estuarine biota and habitats to various conditions
of salinity and flow. The workshops involved approximately thirty scientists and policy makers with expertise in
estuarine ecology and water resource management, and included several of the world's most distinguished estuarine
scientists. The group focused its attention on the estuary between Carquinez Strait and the confluence of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers. The specific operations of the water projects (water exports, gate closures, etc.) were not
directly addressed by the group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The findings of the workshops were assembled in a final report, Managing Freshwater Discharge to the San Francisco
Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary: The Scientific Basis for an Estuarine Standard (SFEP 1993b) (SFEP Report).
All of the conclusions and recommendations in this report were endorsed by a consensus of the estuarine scientists
and managers who participated in the final workshop in August of 1992.

The SFEP Report defined ``consensus'' as follows: ``The term consensus is used to represent group solidarity on an
issue; a judgement arrived at by most of the scientists and managers present. In all cases, the consensus was unanimous
or nearly unanimous.'' SFEP Report, at p. 3. EPA recognizes that representatives from a number of the participating
organizations (the State Water Contractors, the California Department of Water Resources (California DWR), the
State Board, and the USBR) subsequently withdrew their names from the final SFEP Report. According to the Final Report,
the conclusions are based on the consensus that was achieved by the participants at the workshops.

Although the workshop group initially focused on the entrapment zone, they concluded that salinity would be a more
appropriate index for the development of estuarine standards. Salinity was selected for several reasons: It is of
direct ecological importance, it can be measured accurately and easily, and it integrates a number of important estuarine
properties and processes. In particular, it is closely associated with the abundance and distribution of species
at all trophic levels (SFEP 1993b). The workgroup further concluded that the placement of the 2 parts per thousand
isohaline

 should be used to develop estuarine standards.

An ``isohaline'' is defined as a theoretical or imaginary line in the estuary connecting all points of equal salinity.
For example, the phrase ``2

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
near-bottom isohaline'' means a line stretching across the Delta marking the positions where the salinity of the
near-bottom water is 2 parts per thousand. The position of an isohaline in an estuary changes dramatically during
the day because of rising and falling tides, which sometimes move the isohaline as much as 5 miles up or downstream during
a 24 hour period. By convention, a daily isohaline is measured at its daily mean position for the 24 hour period.

Because the difference between surface and near-bottom salinities is small and because the relationship between
them is reasonably well known, surface salinity could also be used. Near-bottom salinity is recommended, however,
because it is a more stable indicator. [Footnote in the original.]

In developing these conclusions, the workshop participants relied in part on a series of papers developed by Dr. Alan
Jassby of the University of California at Davis and Dr. Wim Kimmerer of BioSystems Analysis, Inc. These papers concluded
that the position of the 2 ppt isohaline is closely associated with the abundance of estuarine organisms at all trophic
levels, as well as with the supply of organic matter from phytoplankton production and riverine loading (phytoplankton
POC). The estuarine organisms include primary and secondary zooplankton consumers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neomysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crangon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a major group of benthic consumers in Suisun Bay (mollusks), bottom-foraging fish (starry flounder), and both
survival (striped bass) and abundance (striped bass and longfin smelt) of fish that feed in the water column. For each
of these organisms, with the exception of mollusks, abundance levels increase as the position of the 2 ppt isohaline
is located farther downstream (Jassby 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The SFEP's final report cautioned that these correlations are not proof of cause and effect relationships. That is,
the report did not attempt to identify the causal mechanism linking the salinity regime and the abundance of estuarine
organisms. Further, the report did not address other factors unrelated to water quality, such as overfishing, that
may also have an impact on abundance of certain aquatic resources. Nevertheless, salinity integrates a number of
important estuarine properties, is easy to measure, and is readily understood by all interested parties. The particular
value of 2 ppt near-bottom salinity was selected because it occurs near the upstream limit of marine salt penetration,
is higher than salinities derived from agricultural runoff, is close to the entrapment zone and is associated with
little stratification of the water column. The group concluded that the location of the 2 ppt isohaline, measured
as kilometers upstream from the Golden Gate Bridge, is the most appropriate index of habitat conditions underlying
the variability in biological resources (SFEP 1993b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These findings in the SFEP workshop reports are entirely consistent with other scientific work in the Bay/Delta.
For example, Dr. Peter Moyle testified to the State Board that nursery habitat (represented by areas of low salinity)
in Suisun Bay is now more important than it was historically due to the high risks of entrainment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 faced by fishes in the Delta. After discussing a variety of mechanisms that may be behind the declines of most aquatic
populations of the upper estuary, Dr. Moyle concluded that ``[w]hile the exact mechanisms that account for the importance
of having the [entrapment] zone in Suisun Bay (increased food supplies, physical concentration of organisms, association
with higher flows, etc.) are being debated, there seems little doubt that many fish species depend on this location
for their long-term survival'' (Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9). Dr. Moyle recommended that in wetter years
the zone of low salinity habitat should be located near Roe Island but that in drier years this requirement could be
shifted upstream to Chipps Island. In addition, the USFWS cited the importance of low-salinity habitat in Suisun
Bay in the January to June period in its 1991 proposal to designate critical habitat for Delta smelt under the ESA. 56
FR 50075 (October 3, 1991).

Strictly defined, ``entrainment'' is the displacement of fish or other aquatic organisms from their location in
one waterbody to another as a result of the operation of a water diversion. In the Bay/Delta, however, the term ``entrainment''
is generally used to refer to the destruction of fish or larvae at the intake mechanisms of the many water diversion
facilities in the Delta. Most entrainment occurs when fish or larvae are pulled into screens or pumps by the diversion
apparatus.

c. Ecological Significance of Salinity Levels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is selecting the 2 ppt isohaline as the basis for its proposed criteria in part because that isohaline incorporates
a whole range of factors relevant to the estuary's health, even though the operation of some of these factors is not
fully understood. Some species that show high correlations with the location of the 2 ppt isohaline are not abundant
in low salinity habitat and are probably responding to river flow or other correlated factors. However, salinity
in the 2 ppt range is clearly and directly important to a broad range of estuarine species and the location of this salinity
is strongly associated with the abundance and distribution of many of these species. The SFEP Report emphasized that
it is well established scientifically that salinity has direct ecological importance to many estuarine species
in this estuary and others throughout the world (SFEP 1993b). In fact, much of the distribution of estuarine species
can be explained by their association with specific salinity ranges and their ability to survive and reproduce within
certain salinity limits. The following sections summarize the best available evidence on the direct effects of the
location of low salinity habitat on the distribution and abundance of key species and habitats within the Bay/Delta
estuary. This scientific evidence provides substantial support for the need for the proposed salinity criteria
protecting the water quality necessary to sustain the ecological health of the estuary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypomesus transpacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are found today only in the upper reaches of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary. Early studies by the California
DFG of the two most abundant smelts, longfin smelt and Delta smelt, noted that changes in the historical location of
the entrapment zone would threaten populations of both species (Broadway 1979). In its initial notice of petition
findings for the listing of the Delta smelt as threatened under the ESA, the USFWS found that ``the annual export of
6 million acre-feet of water by Federal, State and private agencies has allowed the intrusion of higher salinity seawater
to the marshes. Because of higher salinities, the Delta smelt has lost spawning and nursery areas in Suisun Bay and
Suisun Marsh.'' 55 FR 52852, 52853 (December 24, 1990). The final rule listing Delta smelt as a threatened species
found that embryonic, larval and post-larval mortality rates increase as salinities in the western Delta increase
and the entrapment zone moves upstream. Delta smelt larvae survive and grow best when the entrapment zone occupies
a broad geographic area with extensive shallow areas. Delta smelt reproduction has probably suffered in recent years
because the entrapment zone has been located east of Suisun Bay. 58 FR 12854 (March 5, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal to list the Delta smelt as a threatened species, the USFWS identified critical habitat for the species
as requiring salinities less than 2 ppt in Suisun Bay from January through June. 56 FR 50075, 50079 (October 3, 1991).
When listing the Delta smelt as threatened, the USFWS deferred designation of critical habitat until October 1993.
In summarizing the factors affecting Delta smelt, the USFWS concluded that the biological characteristics of the
species made it very sensitive to perturbations in its reproductive habitat and larval nursery grounds. The final
listing notice further determined that Suisun Bay is the primary nursery habitat for this species and that the habitat
has been degraded because of higher salinities in the spring due to upstream freshwater diversions. 58 FR 12854, 12860
(March 5, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USFWS's conclusions were also supported by an interagency Delta smelt working group convened by the USFWS after
its proposal to list the species under the ESA. The working group included representatives of USFWS, EPA, USBR, California
DFG, and the California DWR. The working group developed several recommendations to increase abundance levels of
Delta smelt, including maintaining the 2 ppt zone in Suisun Bay during the Delta smelt's early months of life. The working
group's recommendation was that low salinity habitat be kept in Suisun Bay in all years; no attempt was made to adjust
the position of the zone to account for dry year conditions (USFWS 1992f, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USFWS's proposed critical habitat designation has been supported by a recently published paper by biologists
of the California DFG and the University of California at Davis. The authors concluded that Delta smelt are most abundant
in low salinity water associated with the entrapment zone. During the years preceding their decline, Delta smelt
were found most abundantly at sites where low salinity conditions coincided with shallow habitats. Since their decline,
low salinity conditions have been found in areas where little shallow habitat is available. The principal conclusion
of these authors was that ``[r]estoration of the Delta smelt to a sustainable population size is likely to require
maintenance of the [entrapment] zone in Suisun Bay and maintenance of net seaward flows in the lower San Joaquin River
during the period when larvae are present'' (Moyle et al. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Board's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan also acknowledged that the location of the 2 ppt isohaline is important for Delta
smelt, finding that ``existing knowledge suggests that salinities of 2 ppt or less are desired in Suisun Bay from March
through June.'' However, rather than adopting protective salinity criteria, the State Board suggested that protection
of low-salinity habitat would be dealt with as a ``flow'' issue in the subsequent scoping and water rights phases of
its proceedings (1991 Bay/Delta Plan, p. 5&hyph;44). As explained in more detail above, to date the State Board has
failed to adopt any additional standards since its 1991 Bay/Delta Plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Morone saxatilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) support one of the most economically important sportfisheries in the Bay/Delta estuary. The striped bass population
(and consequently the number of anglers) has plummeted since the early 1970's, with populations declining by as much
as 70 percent from historical levels (Stevens et al. 1985; White 1986; CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8). Although
striped bass populations exist elsewhere in entirely freshwater habitats, the species thrives only in estuarine
conditions (Talbot 1966), and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary low salinity habitat appears to provide important
nursery grounds (Wang 1986). Adult striped bass migrate upstream to spawn in fresh water. The planktonic larvae are
carried downstream and concentrate in areas of low salinity (Moyle 1976). When this low salinity zone is located in
Suisun Bay, survival of young bass is improved (Turner and Chadwick 1972). As a result, several parties have recommended
that the entrapment zone be maintained in Suisun Bay to improve striped bass year class survival (Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9;
USBR 1991, WRINT&hyph;USBR&hyph;2; USFWS 1992d, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;19; USFWS 1992e, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;20;
Moyle and Herbold 1989; Moyle, et al. 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other factors, including year-to-year variations in outflow and exports, have also contributed to the decline of
the striped bass population. California DFG has developed a model suggesting that export limitations also are necessary
to preserve the striped bass fishery. Accordingly, California DFG's recent recommendations to protect striped
bass have focused on reducing entrainment of fish, eggs and larvae in water pumps operated by the SWP and the CVP, rather
than on maintaining protective salinity conditions (CDFG 1992e, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;3; D&hyph;1630). However,
according to a series of papers developed for the SFEP-sponsored workshops, models that are based on the downstream
extent of low salinity habitat are at least as accurate in predicting striped bass abundance as the California DFG
model based on flows and exports (Jassby, in SFEP 1993b; CDFG 1992e, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;3). The studies cited above
suggest that, regardless of the effects of entrainment at the diversion pumps, low salinity nursery habitat in Suisun
Bay is important and that this habitat has sharply declined in recent years. Based on these studies, EPA believes that
salinity criteria in Suisun Bay are necessary to protect nursery habitat of the striped bass.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are now restricted to the lower reaches of the rivers flowing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the upper
regions of the San Francisco Bay complex, particularly Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh (Moyle 1976; Moyle 1980). Historically,
this species occurred throughout the lowlands of the Sacramento Valley, but diking and dredging have eliminated
96% of the wetland habitats this species appears to require (Meiorin et al. 1991). Currently, the population lives
largely in the shallow, low salinity habitat of Suisun Bay and Marsh but in early spring adults migrate upstream through
the Delta to spawn near the mouths of the rivers along the Delta's eastern edge (Daniels and Moyle 1983). Although this
migration pattern predominates for most of the splittail, lower concentrations of the species can be found in most
locations in the Delta throughout the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, fewer numbers of newly-spawned splittail have moved across the Delta, back to Suisun Bay. Recent
severe declines in regions in which splittail were formerly abundant resulted in the filing of petitions to list the
species as endangered under the ESA. 50 FR 36184 (July 6, 1993). The only other member of the genus, found in Clear Lake,
California, became extinct in the early 1970's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No physiological studies have been done to determine the specific salinity tolerances of the splittail, but it is
likely that high salinities restrict their downstream range. The scarcity of shallow habitats upstream and the increase
of salinity in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh have greatly restricted the habitat required by this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail recruitment displays a strong relationship to annual outflow (Daniels and Moyle 1983). The
exact mechanism that results in this relationship is unclear; years of higher outflow provide better cues to direct
successful migration upstream by adults, larger areas of flooded vegetation on which the adults can spawn (Caywood
1974), higher flows to transport the newly spawned young downstream, and larger areas of suitable habitat in Suisun
Bay and Suisun Marsh. Protection of historical habitat conditions in the Bay/Delta through the implementation of
the proposed salinity criteria should therefore provide indirect protection for all the needs of this species that
depend on outflow.

_Estuary dependent species. In addition to Delta smelt and striped bass, several other fish species are dependent
on brackish-water nursery habitat. The juveniles of these species, collectively referred to as ``estuary dependent
species'' by the California DFG, live predominantly downstream of the Delta within a salinity range of approximately
0 to 22 ppt, although the range varies somewhat by species. This habitat is larger than the nursery habitat for Delta
smelt and striped bass, but nevertheless has substantially diminished in size as water has been diverted and stored
for upstream uses.

Three of these species, bay shrimp (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crangon franciscorum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

), and longfin smelt (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spirinchus thaleichthys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), depend on brackish-water nursery habitat for a significant portion of their life cycles. Bay shrimp and starry
flounder are important components of commercial and sport fisheries, and their protection is important to maintain
the State's Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing designated uses, as well as the Estuarine Habitat designated use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bay shrimp is the largest shrimp species in the estuary, and has been the most numerous, except during recent prolonged
drought conditions, when abundance has been very low. It supports a commercial bait fishery in the Bay, and is an important
food source for the larger fish of the estuary. Reproductive adults and larvae are found in the more marine habitats
of Central San Francisco Bay and nearshore Gulf of the Farallones. Transforming larvae and early juveniles move into
the Bay from the nearshore ocean, and maturing juveniles are mainly found in warm, shallow, brackish water areas (2
to 22 ppt) of the estuary (CDFG 1992; WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starry flounder also use the brackish areas of San Francisco Bay as nursery habitat. After moving into the Bay as transforming
larvae from the nearshore ocean during the spring, young-of-the-year juvenile flounder (smaller than 70 mm) are
found primarily in warm shallows where salinities are less than 22 ppt (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). By the
second year of life (1+), the fish have moved out of fresh water completely and are concentrated in the brackish water
areas of the Bay. By the third year of life (2+) they have spread throughout the higher salinity areas, and many have
migrated out of the Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starry flounder supports both a commercial and recreational fishery in the San Francisco Bay area. Commercial catch
has varied between 486 thousand pounds in 1980 to a minimum of 40 thousand pounds in 1990. Although starry flounder
are a small component of the flatfish catch (2 percent by weight), they are second only to California halibut in price
per pound at the dock (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). Commercial passenger fishery total catch and catch per
unit effort in San Pablo Bay have declined dramatically since the mid-1970's. Abundance of starry flounder young-of-the-year
and one-year-olds (1+) has been consistently low since 1986, and older starry flounder (two years old and older) have
also declined in the Bay since the mid-1970's, based on Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel logs (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until recently, longfin smelt has been one of the most abundant fish species in the estuary. This species spawns in
freshwater, and larvae and juveniles smaller than 50 mm are predominantly found in brackish water with bottom salinities
less than 18 ppt. According to California DFG, water with less than 18 ppt salinity in the spring months of March through
June constitutes important nursery habitat for longfin smelt (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). Recent populations
of longfin smelt have been very low, and in 1991 the population reached the lowest number ever recorded since monitoring
was initiated in 1967. As a result, this species has been the subject of a petition for listing under the ESA. See Petition
for Listing Under the Endangered Species Act_Longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail, National Heritage Institute
(November 5, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are close correlations between the location of the near-bottom 2 ppt isohaline during winter/spring and annual
abundance indices of bay shrimp, starry flounder, and longfin smelt (Jassby 1992). Annual abundances are low when
the position of the near-bottom 2 ppt isohaline is upstream and does not move to and remain at a position near Roe Island
for any extended period of time. Under these circumstances, the brackish-water nursery habitat favored by these
species is primarily limited to Suisun Bay. Salinity data from California DFG studies indicate that when near-bottom
salinities are at or below 2 ppt near Roe Island in Suisun Bay, salinities downstream over the large shallow flats of
San Pablo Bay are characteristically less than 18 to 22 ppt (CDFG 1993). In years when the position of the near-bottom
2 ppt isohaline moves downstream at least as far as Roe Island in the spring, the area of low-salinity habitat expands
into the large shallows of San Pablo Bay and these species are more abundant. These areas of San Pablo Bay provide greatly
increased habitat within the salinity ranges preferred by juveniles of these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with striped bass, other factors are also likely to contribute to year-to-year variations in abundance of these
species, including the strength of net landward bottom currents (shrimp and flounder), coastal distribution of
reproductive adults and larvae (shrimp and flounder), and successful downstream transport and dispersal of larvae
and juveniles (smelt) (CDFG 1992, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6). However, brackish-water nursery habitat is essential
to the juveniles of these three species, and is a major factor in the strong correlation between the position of the
near-bottom 2 ppt isohaline and abundance. According to studies by California DFG, an index of brackish water habitat
is strongly correlated with abundance indices for these three species (CDFG 1992, figs 1&hyph;3, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;6).
EPA's proposed salinity criteria, by providing estuarine habitat conditions similar to the healthier reference
period of the late 1960's to early 1970's, should restore and maintain the brackish-water nursery habitat required
by these three species.

_Suisun Bay Tidal Wetland Species. The tidal wetlands bordering Suisun Bay are characterized as brackish marsh because
of their unique combination of species typical of both freshwater wetlands and more saline wetlands.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Suisun Marsh itself, bordering Suisun Bay on the north, is the largest contiguous brackish water marsh in the United
States. A large portion of the wetland habitat (approximately 44,000 acres) in this marsh is currently diked and managed
for waterfowl use and hunting. Approximately 10,000 acres bordering Suisun Bay are still fully tidal (Meiorin 1991).

There are currently no salinity criteria protecting the Estuarine Habitat, Wildlife Habitat, and other fish and
wildlife uses of the brackish tidal marshes of Suisun Bay. These large tidal marshes are distinct from the ``managed''
marshes in the Suisun Bay. EPA's approval of the 1978 Delta Plan criteria was explicitly conditioned on the State Board's
commitment to develop additional criteria for the tidal marshes and to protect aquatic life in the Suisun Marsh channels
and open waters. Because these conditions have not been met, EPA, in its September 3, 1991 letter on the 1991 Bay/Delta
Plan, disapproved the standards for Suisun Marsh and stated that the State Board should immediately develop salinity
objectives sufficient to protect aquatic life and the brackish tidal wetlands surrounding Suisun Marsh.

These tidal marshes provide habitat for a large, highly diverse, and increasingly rare ecological community. The
recent ``Status and Trends'' reports published by the SFEP listed 154 wildlife species associated with the brackish
marshes surrounding Suisun Bay (Harvey, et al. 1992), including a number of candidates for listing under the ESA.
These include the Suisun song sparrow (

), delta tule pea (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lathyrus jepsonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), Mason's lilaeopsis (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilaeopsis masonii

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and soft-haired bird's beak (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cordylanthus mollis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These rare species are all found exclusively in tidally inundated marsh.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the SFEP-sponsored workshops, a comprehensive literature review and intensive field surveys of marsh
vegetation were undertaken to document the responses of estuarine marsh communities to changes in the salinity regime
(Collins and Foin 1993). The study concluded that salinity levels in the tidal marshes play a major role in the distribution
and abundance of plant species. In addition, average tidal marsh salinity levels are related to the position of the
2 ppt isohaline, although local controls on salinity are important in some areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study also found that recent increases in salinity caused by a combination of upstream diversions and drought
have adversely affected the tidal marsh communities. As salinity has intruded, brackish marsh plants which depend
on soils low in salt content (especially the tules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus californicus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. acutus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have died back in both the shoreline marshes and in some interior marsh channel margins of the western half of Suisun
Bay. These plants have been replaced by plants typically growing in saline soils, especially cordgrass (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spartina foliosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This has been associated with erosion of the marsh margins, significantly reducing the tidal marsh acreage in some
areas. In addition, tules in the upper intertidal zone have been replaced by the smaller and more salt tolerant alkali
bulrush (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus robustus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These changes have significantly affected available habitat for a variety of wildlife that nest and feed in these
areas, including the Suisun song sparrow, marsh wren, common yellowthroat, black-crowned night heron, and snowy
egret (Collins and Foin 1993; Granholm 1987a; 1987b). The loss of habitat for the Suisun song sparrow is of particular
concern, since individuals of this species are found only in the already fragmented marshes bordering Suisun Bay,
occupy an established territory for their lifetime, and depend on tall tules for successful reproduction and cover
from predators (Marshall 1948).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there have been no studies of the direct effects of salinity on rarer plant species, these species are likely
to have the same salinity requirements as non-rare species residing in the same plant communities. Delta tule pea
and Suisun aster are associated with tules along the banks of tidal sloughs (CDFG 1991). Mason's lilaeopsis is also
found along tidal banks, associated with the more freshwater marsh species, including tules, and in the shade of riparian
shrubs such as willows (CDFG 1991). Suisun thistle and soft-haired bird's beak are found in the few remaining higher
elevation tidal marshes. All of these species are limited to marsh areas seasonally inundated with fresh to brackish
water, and depend on such conditions to varying degrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those brackish marsh plants depending on freshwater conditions, the most critical growth period is February
through June. If suitable lowlands were present upstream, increases in the estuary's salinity gradient would allow
brackish tidal marsh communities to migrate upstream. However, the floodplains and other lowlands suitable for
the evolution of tidal marshes are absent upstream of Suisun Bay (SFEP 1993b). As a result, increases in tidal water
salinity may significantly reduce the already severely limited freshwater and brackish marsh habitats, and will
threaten the natural diversity of the estuary's wetland communities. Maintaining historical levels of low-salinity
habitat in Suisun Marsh is therefore essential to protect Estuarine Habitat, Wildlife Habitat, Rare and Endangered
Species, and other uses designated for protection by the State's water quality standards.

Preliminary considerations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section discusses three issues that affect EPA's proposal: the proper level of protection for designated uses,
the basis for choosing the locations for measuring the proposed criteria, and the proper time period for maintaining
the proposed criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Level of Protection. One of the key recommendations of the SFEP-sponsored workshops was that environmental goals
for the estuary would be most effective if expressed in terms of restoring conditions to those that existed at specific
historical periods. If a certain level of ecosystem restoration is selected as a goal, then the relationship between
abundance and the location of the 2 ppt isohaline (and the amount of water necessary to achieve that isohaline) can
be used as a basis for setting standards that will achieve those goals. (SFEP 1993b).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This historically-based approach is consistent with EPA's National Program Guidance for Biological Criteria for
Surface Waters (USEPA 1990). EPA's National Program Guidance recommends that aquatic communities in waterbodies
subject to anthropogenic disturbance be assessed in comparison to similar, but unimpaired waterbodies (a reference
condition). Although the Guidance discusses designation of a reference site to compare directly with an impaired
waterbody, analysis of historical records is also recommended. In the case of the Bay/Delta, a reference waterbody
is not available. Instead, reference conditions have been based on historical information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed salinity criteria reflect estuarine habitat conditions that existed prior to 1976. In the recent State
Board hearings, EPA, NMFS, and USWFS recommended standards that would restore habitat conditions to levels that
existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's (USFWS 1992g, WRINT&hyph;FWS&hyph;10).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 This period generally reflects conditions that occurred in the estuary before fish habitat and populations began
to experience the most recent significant declines, and therefore serves as a useful definition of a healthy fishery
resource. Land use patterns and upstream water developments had largely stabilized by the end of this period so that
increases in project impacts are the dominant change associated with the subsequent decline in fishery resources.
The reclamation of wetlands was largely complete by the 1920's, and the largest of the upstream developments, Shasta
Reservoir, was completed in the early 1940's.

This restoration goal is less protective than the ``without project'' goal targeted by the State Board as part of its
water quality standards in 1978. In the 1978 Delta Plan, the State Board adopted standards intended to achieve levels
that would have existed in the absence of the state and Federal water projects, and agreed to revise the standards if
necessary to achieve this goal. This ``without projects'' goal was never formally incorporated into the State's
water quality standards, and its continued validity as a stated goal is in question given the court's decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
State Water Resources Control Board, supra

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
) (reviewing the 1978 Delta Plan and rejecting the ``without projects'' approach). EPA continues to believe that
fully offsetting the impacts of water development should be the goal of long-term planning efforts by the State Board
and other agencies. However, because of the precipitous decline in the biological communities of the estuary in the
last decade, this goal is no longer reasonably attainable in the short term, given the existing physical facilities
and water project operations in the Delta. As a result, EPA, USFWS and NMFS have recommended that the State Board immediately
set standards sufficient to restore estuarine habitat conditions to those that existed in the late 1960's and early
1970's, and to establish a long-term goal of fully offsetting the impacts of water development (USFWS 1992g, WRINT&hyph;FWS&hyph;10).
This long-term goal is consistent with the goals of the recently-enacted Central Valley Project Improvement Act
(Title 34 of P.L. 102&hyph;575, 106 Stat. 4600) (Central Valley Project Improvement Act), which include programs
to mitigate the adverse effects incurred as a result of the construction of the CVP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ideally, EPA would use the late 1960's to early 1970's habitat conditions as both the targeted level of protection
and the historical reference period. However, to better reflect the natural variability of wet and dry years, EPA
is proposing criteria that vary according to the ``water year type''. The water year type concept is already fully
integrated into the operations of California water management, and the State Board's classification of years into
one of five categories (wet, above normal, below normal, dry, and critically dry) is accepted as the standard water
year type classification scheme.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period of the late 1960's to early 1970's, however, contained no dry or critically dry years and only one above normal
year. Thus, in order to provide an adequate representation of the different water year types, EPA is proposing the
use of the period 1940 to 1975 as the historic reference period. An examination of the historical record reveals that
this 35 year period was one of fairly consistent hydrological conditions. The period is bracketed by major hydrological
changes_the construction of Shasta Dam immediately before this period, and the extended drought and increased water
exports beginning immediately after this period in 1976.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including the longer 1940&hyph;1975 period as the historical reference period allows better estimation of the salinity
regime for different water year types than would use of only the late 1960's to early 1970's. Given that the hydrological
conditions were fairly consistent throughout the longer 1940&hyph;1975 period, EPA believes this longer historical
reference period serves as a better long term indicator through all water year types of the habitat conditions existing
in the recommended target years of the late 1960's to early 1970's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of the historical salinity regime is presented in appendix II. Salinity records extend back only
to 1967, whereas daily flow estimates are available from October 1929. Using models created by California DWR relating
flow and salinity allows reconstruction of the salinity regimes in the historical reference period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basis for locations selected. Three locations for the proposed 2 ppt isohaline were selected to correspond to protection
of three different types of estuarine habitat in different water years. Together, the use of these three locations
will maintain the natural variability in salinity levels that characterize the historical data set at medium to lower
flow levels (those substantially within the control of upstream diverters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Roe Island.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 2 ppt isohaline occurs at or below Roe Island at times of high outflow accompanying storms with uncontrolled runoff,
as well as at times of high water releases from upstream dams. These flows carry many young fish from the Delta downstream
into Suisun Bay. Because the entrapment zone will consistently be near the broad shallows and large marsh areas of
Suisun Bay, the young fish and other organisms associated with the zone will be distributed into these diverse and
productive habitats, greatly increasing the extent and value of their available habitat. This location will also
maximize the inputs of production from Suisun Marsh and the shallows of Suisun Bay into the entrapment zone, and will
provide greatly increased areas of medium to low salinity nursery habitat for estuary dependent species in San Pablo
Bay.

Chipps Island. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The downstream end of Chipps Island marks the upstream end of Suisun Bay. As noted above, low salinity habitat in Suisun
Bay has been well documented as an important nursery area for Delta smelt, striped bass, and other estuarine species.
Suisun Bay also represents the farthest upstream extent of large areas of shallow habitat. These shallow habitats
are more productive than deeper channels (Cloern et al. 1983), and horizontal flows across these shallows bring food
sources into the entrapment zone. For some species, particularly Delta smelt, shallow areas near the entrapment
zone are a preferred habitat (Moyle et al. 1992), perhaps as a refuge from predation. When the average salinity at Chipps
Island is less than 2 ppt, organisms associated with this habitat will be in or near the shallow habitats of Suisun Bay
for half of each tidal cycle.

Confluence of Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers marks the point where organisms associated with low salinity
habitat are exposed to the detrimental conditions in the lower San Joaquin River. The higher mortalities and poorer
habitat conditions associated with the lower San Joaquin River have been documented at length in testimony to the
State Board (USBR 1992, WRINT&hyph;USBR&hyph;2; Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9). This location, then, provides
a suitable upstream limit for the 2 ppt isohaline. When average salinities at the confluence reach the 2 ppt level,
the organisms associated with low salinity habitat will have access to the shallow habitats downstream in Suisun
Bay only during the lower low tide point of the tidal cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Period of protection. Changes in water quality that have affected aquatic resources have been greatest during the
period from February to June. Under naturally-occurring hydrological conditions, flows in these months were often
very large while in summer flow rates declined and salinity in the delta increased. Upstream diversions have altered
this natural pattern by reducing peak spring flows and, in some years, increasing flows during the late summer and
fall months. The changes in summertime water quality (towards lower salinity) occur during a season when most of the
fish species have already completed their spawning or migration (Monroe and Kelly 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The abundance and reproductive success of almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper estuary depend
strongly on conditions during the months from February through June (Stevens 1977; Daniels and Moyle 1983; Stevens
and Miller 1983; Moyle and Herbold 1989; Herbold et al. 1992; SWC 1992, WRINT&hyph;SWC&hyph;1). These species survive
and reproduce more successfully when Suisun Bay has large areas of low salinity habitat (less than 2 ppt), San Pablo
Bay has large areas of medium to low salinities (less than 18 to 22 ppt), river outflows are high, bottom currents are
strong, temperature is low, and the areas of greatest turbidity are downstream of the Delta. Because of the combination
of drought conditions and high levels of water exports, these conditions have occurred very rarely in recent years.
Therefore, EPA's proposed criteria center on these five months.

and at the Sacramento/San Joaquin River confluence from February through June. The criteria replicate the average
number of days on which the 2 ppt isohaline occurred at or downstream from each of these locations during the historical
period 1940&hyph;1975, inclusive, classified by water year type. Because no critically dry years occurred in the
period from 1940 to 1975, the required number of days for critically dry years is based on an extrapolation of the data.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria are measured using a 14-day moving average. The use of a 14-day moving average allows the mean
location to be achieved despite the varying strength of tidal currents during the lunar cycle because any 14 day period
will include the full range of spring and neap tidal conditions.

Numbers indicate required number of days (based on a 14-day moving average) at or downstream from each location for
the 5-month period from February through June. The water year classifications are identical to those included in
the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan for the Sacramento River Basin. Roe Island salinity shall be measured at the salinity measuring
station maintained by the USBR at Port Chicago (km 64). Chipps Island salinity shall be measured at the Collinsville
station, and salinity at the Confluence shall be measured at the Mallard Slough station, both of which are maintained
by the California Department of Water Resources. The Roe Island number represents the maximum number of days, based
on the adjustment described below.

In a wet year, the 2 ppt isohaline must be maintained at or downstream of the Confluence at least 150 days during February

Adjusting the Roe Island standard to reflect intra-year storm variability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the proposed criteria at Roe Island are intended, in part, to replicate low salinity habitat conditions
resulting from spring storm events. Storm events in the spring provide many benefits to aquatic resources of the estuary.
Large areas of flooded vegetation provide ideal spawning for some species, high flows transport many planktonic
larvae downstream, and translocation of low salinity habitat allows wide dispersion of many species which reduces
predation (and perhaps competition) and replenishes otherwise isolated areas. In addition, the variability in
salinity over a wide range is thought to be an important tool in preventing the buildup of molluscan species and, thus,
ensures that more food will accumulate in the entrapment zone (Nichols 1985; Nichols and Pamatmat 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria at Roe Island, unadjusted, would fully protect low salinity habitat, but would not accurately
reflect the historical natural variability in runoff and precipitation. The distribution of storm systems within
the October to April wet season varies greatly year-to-year. In some years, all storm events are concentrated in early
winter, whereas in others the storm events are evenly distributed or concentrated in the spring. This natural historical
variability is reflected in the proposed salinity criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without some form of adjustments, salinity criteria at a fixed downstream location would also result in more flows
through the estuary than might be necessary to maintain water quality (that is, the ``water costs'' would be unnecessarily
high). The flows necessary to hold the 2 ppt isohaline at a particular location in the estuary are substantially less
than the flows needed to move that isohaline downstream to a different position. In the Bay/Delta, these higher flows
used to move the isohaline could come either from natural storm events or from controlled reservoir releases. The
proposed standard provides for an adjustment of the Roe Island standard to more closely replicate natural spring
storm cycles. This adjustment will avoid adverse impacts on species (such as the winter-run salmon) dependent on
upstream reservoir conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the criteria of number of days for a given year type at Roe Island would not apply unless and until
the average daily salinity at Roe Island attains the 2 ppt level through natural uncontrolled flows. Following the
occurrence of such an event, the 14 day average salinity at Roe Island must not exceed 2 ppt for the number of days specified
in Table 1. Therefore, the number of days listed under Roe Island represents the maximum of the number of days that may
be required. In effect, this adjustment provides that the additional water needed to move the isohaline downstream
to Roe Island will come from natural storms rather than from reservoir releases or export restrictions. This approach
better reflects the natural variability in timing and quantity of runoff and significantly reduces the water supply
impacts of the proposed criteria relative to criteria that do not account for this variability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the CWA, the states have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects
that the State Board would implement these salinity criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements
included in water rights permits issued by the State Board. Consistent with the mandates of section 101(g) of the CWA,
the State Board has full discretion in determining the source of water flows necessary to meet these criteria. EPA
has intentionally drafted its proposed criteria to be measured at or downstream of the confluence of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers. This allows the State Board maximum latitude in choosing a mix of flow conditions and export
restrictions in both river basins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the State Board has full discretion to develop an implementation plan for these criteria in the manner it
chooses, EPA and the other federal agencies involved in water resource management issues in the Bay/Delta (USFWS,
NMFS, and USBR) urge the State Board to spread the burden across as broad a spectrum of water users as possible. The economic
analysis prepared in conjunction with this proposal suggests that spreading the burden results in substantially
lower costs than does imposing the burden on a particular geographical area or a narrowly defined group of water users.
This is not just a matter of fairness. The federal agencies' preliminary discussions with water project managers
indicated that increasing the pool of contributors substantially increases the operational flexibility of the
water system, and thereby reduces the total impact of meeting the proposed criteria. For that reason, the federal
agencies hope the State Board will continue the concept it adopted in its proposal for D&hyph;1630, and will allocate
the burden of meeting these criteria across the broad range of the state's water users.

The State's designated uses for the Bay/Delta include Cold Freshwater Habitat to sustain aquatic resources associated
with a coldwater environment, and Fish Migration to protect those fish which migrate through the estuary. The migratory
fish species associated with the cold-water environment in the Bay/Delta are chinook salmon (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) and steelhead trout (

).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there are four distinct populations of salmon in the Sacramento/San Joaquin river systems, each named
for the season of their migration upstream as adults. The fall-run population is now the most numerous; in recent years,
typically 90 percent of all Central Valley spawners are fall-run fish. Increased hatchery production of fall-run
fish has resulted in stable spawning returns of fall-run fish passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam on the Sacramento
River; however, wild fall-run chinook abundance is low and is decreasing. The Sacramento River system still supports
small winter-run, spring-run and late fall-run populations, but these populations have all declined dramatically
in recent years (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7). The winter-run population is now listed as threatened
under the ESA. The spring-run population has recently reached low enough levels to be recognized as a species of special
concern by the State of California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steelhead trout are also cold-water migratory fish within the Sacramento River System. They have suffered a 90 percent
decline since the late 1960's, and are supported largely by hatchery production (CDFG 1992a, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;14).

The San Joaquin River system supported both fall and spring runs until the 1940's when Friant Dam was built. The dam
prevented the spring-run fish from reaching cool upstream areas suitable for summer rearing, so the spring-run disappeared
and presently there is only a fall-run population. Recently, the San Joaquin population has been highly variable,
reaching very low levels in times of drought, and responding quickly to higher wet year flows. Inadequate stream flows,
water developments, poor water quality, water diversions, and habitat deterioration have had varying degrees of
impact. Continuing high levels of water diversions from the San Joaquin River and tributaries, and high exports out
of the South Delta, in concert with the recent extended drought have caused major impacts to all San Joaquin tributary
runs. Population levels are extremely low, and the 1991 brood year may only produce a total of 100 to 300 returning adults
in 1994 when these adults return to spawn at the end of their three year life cycle (CDFG 1992c, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;25).

Salmon and steelhead populations are subject to increased mortality when exposed to high temperatures and when diverted
out of the main channels of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers into less suitable habitat. Those fish diverted from
the main channels are also subject to increased mortality as water exports at the State and Federal pumping plants
in the south Delta increase. USFWS tagged smolt
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 studies between 1984 and 1989 found that smolts migrating out of the Sacramento River system in the spring survived
on average approximately 3.4 times better in the Sacramento main channel than in the interior (central) Delta. Results
from studies carried out in the spring of 1985 to 1990 showed on average approximately 2 times better survival in the
main channel of the San Joaquin River than in Old River, a secondary channel. Higher temperatures affect smolt mortality
both in the main channel and in the central Delta. For example, the recent (1992) USFWS results from spring tagged smolt
releases into the central Delta showed that mortality was approximately 21/2 times greater at 67 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

State and federal legislators have recognized the serious threat to the continued existence of migratory fishes
in the Bay/Delta. In 1988, the California State legislature mandated a restoration goal of doubling natural salmon
and steelhead production by the year 2000, and required development of a plan to meet this goal. Salmon, Steelhead
Trout, and Anadromous Fisheries Program Act; codified at Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect;6900 et seq. (West 1991).
In response to this mandate, California DFG published the Central Valley Salmon and Steelhead Restoration and Enhancement
Plan in 1990 (CDFG 1990a). California DFG recommended that the State Board adopt an objective of maintaining the survival
rate of salmon smolts passing through the estuary at the ``without projects'' historical level, and listed specific
actions for the consideration of the State Board to implement this objective. Also, Congress recently enacted the
Central Valley Project Improvement Act, which requires that a program be developed and implemented to ensure that
natural production of anadromous fish in Central Valley rivers and streams will be ``sustainable at levels at least
twice the average levels attained during the period 1967&hyph;1991.''

In order to protect fall-run salmon, the 1978 Delta Plan included minimum flow objectives (below those set for striped
bass) and mandated gate closures to help keep fry out of the central Delta when flows were above 12,000 cubic feet per
second (cfs) during the period January 1 to April 15. In addition, gate closures through May, designed to protect striped
bass, have also provided protection for out-migrating salmon smolts. These measures were considered inadequate
by the fisheries agencies (USFWS, NMFS, and California DFG). At the 1987 Water Quality Control Plan hearings, these
agencies recommended flow objectives based on 1940 historical flows (without project levels) that would have significantly
increased protection for fall-run salmon. Similarly, in the 1988 Draft Water Quality Control Plan (SWRCB 1988),
the State Board staff recommended objectives for Sacramento fall-run salmon based on average spring flow conditions
from 1930 to 1987, and for San Joaquin fall-run salmon based on flow conditions from 1953 to 1987. However, this Plan
was not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan established additional criteria designed to protect salmon. The State Board set new temperature
criteria of 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F at Freeport and Vernalis from April 1 through June 30 and September 1 through November 30 to protect Cold Fresh-Water
Habitat for fall-run salmon. The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan also set a temperature criterion of 66
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F at Freeport from January through March to protect winter-run salmon. EPA disapproved these criteria because
the evidence in the State Board's submittal did not demonstrate that they would be sufficient to protect cold-water
habitat for these species. Based on the supporting evidence in the State Board's submittal and the Central Valley
Salmon and Steelhead Restoration and Enhancement Plan (CDFG 1990a), EPA recommended that the State Board adopt a
65 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F criterion, or an alternative that is scientifically defensible. EPA also disapproved the State's temperature
criteria because they were subject to ``controllable factors'' (that is, temperature criteria were to be met only
if they could be attained using a limited set of implementation measures). With this limitation such criteria are
unlikely to be protective, especially since the State Board specifically prohibited the use of reservoir releases
to reduce temperatures in the Delta (SWRCB, 1991).

EPA believes that the State should continue to work on developing scientifically-defensible long-term temperature
criteria sufficient to protect cold-water habitat for salmon migrating through the estuary. Temperature has been
consistently used nationwide as a basis for water quality criteria, and there is strong scientific evidence that
temperature affects survival of salmon smolts as they move through the Delta (Kjelson, et al., 1989; USFWS 1992a,
WRINT-USFWS&hyph;7, USFWS 1992b and USFWS 1992c, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;8). However, EPA acknowledges that specific
temperature criteria are difficult to establish and implement presently in the Delta because historic temperature
levels have been highly variable and respond quickly to ambient air temperatures, and because there is insufficient
information on the effectiveness and feasibility of various methods of lowering temperature. It is likely that there
are short time periods (on the order of days to a few weeks) during which efforts at temperature control could be successful
and provide increased smolt survival. However, existing models predicting changes in temperature in response to
water project operations use a monthly temporal structure and only provide results as monthly means. Thus, these
models cannot be used to analyze measures that could provide improved conditions over shorter periods of time. In
addition, management of reservoir releases to provide benefits to salmon both in the Delta and in the upstream reaches
has not been thoroughly assessed (Kelley, et al. 1991; Mann and Abbott 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies to develop improved reservoir and river temperature models with a shorter time-step and improved predictive
capability for the entire Sacramento system are just beginning under the auspices of Trinity County, the University
of California at Davis, and the California DFG. These studies will also include a direct analysis of the effect of temperature
management alternatives on salmon populations. Additional work to develop effective temperature models has been
mandated by section 3406(g) of the recently-enacted Central Valley Project Improvement Act. It should be possible
to use information from these studies to set temperature criteria in the near future, and EPA will continue to work
with the State to develop specific temperature criteria for the Delta. However, at this time, EPA is not proposing
temperature criteria to replace those criteria disapproved in EPA's September 3, 1991 letter, and is instead proposing
the salmon smolt survival criteria described below.

c. Proposed Smolt Survival Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because at this time EPA has not developed an adequate scientific basis for precise temperature criteria, EPA is proposing
``smolt survival criteria'' to protect the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated uses in the Bay/Delta
estuary. These criteria are based on a smolt survival index that quantifies and predicts the survival of salmon migrating
through the Delta. The index can be used to determine whether the Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat uses
are impaired in the Bay/Delta. When applied in criteria, the index measures and can control the condition of the resource
at risk by directly assessing and limiting the loss of salmon smolts within the Delta due to a variety of impaired water
quality conditions. The use of this index is consistent with the integrated approach envisioned by the National Program
Guidance for Biological Criteria for Surface Waters (USEPA 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Smolt Survival Models. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The smolt survival indices are based on USFWS models described in Kjelson et al. (1989), USFWS (1992a) (WRINT-USFWS&hyph;7)
and USFWS (1992b). These models are summarized more fully in Appendix III. The models are empirical; that is, they
are in large part based on the results of experiments measuring and comparing smolt survival under a number of different
physical conditions of varying migration pathways, water temperatures, flow rates, and rates of exports from the
Delta. The models underlying the salmon smolt survival criteria are complex; additional information about the methods
used in constructing the Sacramento and San Joaquin indices is contained in Appendix III and the administrative record
to the proposal. For the Sacramento River system, the proposed salmon smolt survival criteria are based on the most
recent model (USFWS 1992b) for predicting migration success for the Sacramento River fall-run population, and rely
on the relationship between smolt survival and three factors: temperature, diversion out of the mainstem Sacramento
River, and export rates. The San Joaquin model is based on experimental data, and relies on the relationship between
salmon smolt survival and river flows, diversion into Old River, and export rates. Consistent with the implementation
recommendations of USFWS, NMFS, and California DFG, the San Joaquin model assumes that a barrier will be in place at
the head of Old River during the peak migration season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verifying the models used to generate the salmon smolt criteria is a continuing process using code-wire tagged smolt
studies conducted by the USFWS (USFWS 1992b, 1993). Although these models represent the present state-of-the-art
in Bay/Delta salmon fisheries management, EPA anticipates that the models will continue to be verified, updated
and refined each year by USFWS to reflect additional data collection results, and believes that continuing verification
is necessary to assure that outmigrating smolts are protected. In the event that USFWS modifies its models, recommended
index values, or recommended implementation measures, EPA intends that the criteria will be amended accordingly
in the next triennial review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In developing the goals or target index values for its proposal, EPA is relying primarily on the goal of restoring habitat
conditions to those existing in the late 1960's and early 1970's, as recommended in the Interagency Statement of Principles.
Strict adherence to this recommendation would suggest using the index values associated with that historical period
as the target index values. These values are included in Table 2, which provides estimated index values for different
historical periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of their recent expert testimony to the State Board, USFWS estimated these historical survival indices under
different conditions (USFWS 1992c, WRINT-USFWS&hyph;8). The Sacramento River historical values are based on an
early version of the Sacramento River model (Kjelson et al. 1989). There would be minor changes in the estimates using
the most up-to-date model (USFWS 1992b). For example, recalculating the Sacramento River value for the 1956&hyph;1970
historical period yields a mean of the five-year types of .37, compared to the .36 indicated in Table 2.

For a number of reasons, however, strict adherence to the late 1960's and early 1970's target is inappropriate. Salmon
fisheries, especially on the San Joaquin River, were already somewhat degraded during that historical period, and
the degradation has been more severe in drier years. This is demonstrated in Table 2, above, which provides estimated
historical survival index values for the relevant period. This Table shows that the decline in the survival index
was more pronounced in critical, dry, and below normal water years than in wetter years. Accordingly, to protect salmon
from falling to dangerously low population levels, and more nearly mimic the natural historical response of smolts
migrating through the Delta to year-to-year changes in hydrology, EPA is proposing more protective target values
in drier years and less in wetter years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the Sacramento River system, EPA believes salmon smolt migration will be protected if the long-term average survival
over all water year types replicates the target historical period values. Protection at the late 1960's to early 1970's
level in the wetter years is not necessary if better protection is afforded migrating smolts in the drier years. On
the San Joaquin River system, however, the drop in survival has been more severe in drier years, the runs are smaller
and more at risk, and the overall survival index was less than in the Sacramento system during the target historical
period. For that reason, in order to protect the Fish Migration designated use on the San Joaquin, EPA is proposing
index values that afford both better protection in drier years and overall index values that are higher than in the
historical late 1960's to early 1970's period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve this level of protection and to address this bias in the historical reference period index values, EPA is
proposing the use of target values derived from the recommendations and analyses carried out by the Delta Team of the
Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee. This interagency group consists of representatives from the USFWS, California
DFG, California DWR, NMFS, and USBR. Its reports (Five Agency Delta Salmon Team, 1991a, 1991b) represent a consensus
on the most effective and feasible implementation measures to protect downstream migrant salmon smolts in the Delta.
In preparing its recommendations for the 1992 State Board hearings, USFWS reviewed recommendations from the Five
Agency Delta Salmon Team in its salmon smolt model, and presented a set of index values and corresponding operational
recommendations to the State Board (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7; USFWS 1992c). These index values, which
are intended to be consistent with the fisheries agencies recommended target index values that would restore habitat
conditions and salmon populations to those characteristic of the late 1960's to early 1970's (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7;
USFWS 1992c, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;8; CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8), are shown in Table 3. The values for
the Sacramento River index differ slightly from those presented in the 1992 State Board hearings because these Table
3 values are based on the most recent version of the Sacramento River model.

Finally, in arriving at index values for its proposal contained in Table 4, EPA has adjusted the index values of Table
3 to meet concerns over potential closure of the Georgiana Slough. As discussed below, EPA has been engaged in consultations
with USFWS and NMFS under the ESA about possible effects of EPA's water quality standards actions on threatened and
endangered species. During the course of these consultations, it was suggested that one of the measures the Five Agency
Chinook Salmon Committee had recommended as an effective protective measure for salmon smolts_putting a temporary
barrier at the head of Georgiana Slough_may have deleterious effects on the Delta smelt and other native aquatic life
in the central Delta, and possibly on adult salmon returning upstream. For that reason, EPA has recomputed the index
values (see Table 4) to reflect model results if the Georgiana Slough were left open. Lower exports, particularly
during times of peak San Joaquin salmon outmigration, were incorporated as an additional feasible and effective
implementation measure benefiting salmon, in part to compensate for the additional mortality associated with keeping
Georgiana Slough open. EPA believes that these adjustments still provide protection consistent with the goal of
restoring habitat conditions to those existing in the late 1960's to early 1970's (mean Sacramento River survival
index of .37), while also taking into account achievable implementation measures. The recomputed index values in
Table 4 are included as EPA's proposal.

To protect both Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat designated, EPA proposes that the specific smolt survival
criteria in Table 4, above, be adopted for the Bay/Delta. As explained above, the proposed Sacramento River criteria
are modified from the USFWS indices in Table 3. The San Joaquin River criteria are the same as Table 3. The Sacramento
River criteria provide overall protection at approximately the 1956&hyph;1970 historical level (.37 mean survival
index). The San Joaquin River criteria provides better protection than the 1956&hyph;1970 historical level (.27
mean survival index). Both sets of criteria provide better protection than the 1956&hyph;1970 historical period
in drier years, and less protection in wetter years. These criteria should provide more consistent smolt survival
and help avoid situations where extraordinary measures are necessary to preserve runs, particularly in the San Joaquin
River tributaries. Water year type designations are identical to State Board classifications (SWRCB 1992a).

d. Implementation Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under the CWA, the States have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects
that the State Board would implement these criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements
included in water rights permits issued by the State Board. EPA believes that the State Board would have a number of
possible implementation approaches for achieving the salmon smolt survival criteria. In the recent State Board
hearings, USFWS recommended a series of implementation measures (based on the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee
proposals) designed to achieve the smolt survival indices recommended in the joint statement by USFWS, NMFS and EPA.
For the Sacramento River, these included closure of the Delta Cross Channel from April through June, closure of Georgiana
Slough from April 15 to June 15, and minimum Sacramento Flow at Rio Vista of 4000 cfs from April through June. For the
San Joaquin River, these measures included requiring a range of flows from 2,000 to 10,000 cfs at Vernalis from April
15 to May 15; requiring minimum flows of 1000 cfs at Jersey Point from April through June, except from April 15 to May
15, when higher flows from 1000 to 3000 cfs would be required; and placing a full barrier in upper Old River from April
through May. Total water exports would be curtailed to a range from 6000 cfs in wet years to 2000 cfs in critically dry
years from April 15 to May 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the USFWS models, these particular measures will achieve the proposed smolt survival indices in Table 3.
However, as discussed earlier, EPA has incorporated into its proposed target index values changes to the recommended
implementation measures based on concerns about the effect of these measures on other aquatic resources. Given the
nature of the index itself, however, there is substantial flexibility in how the target values can be achieved. For
example, if flows are increased above the recommended levels in the San Joaquin River, the associated export limits
could also be increased while achieving the same level of protection. Reductions in Sacramento River temperatures
would also provide significant benefits. Although temperature controls were not included in the USFWS recommendations,
they are an important variable in the USFWS model, and may be the most significant factor affecting smolt survival
in the Sacramento River system. Implementation measures affecting temperature may therefore be an effective means
of attaining the smolt survival criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also evidence that short-term operational changes implemented at peak migration times coincident with
critical periods of high ambient air and water temperature may provide significant benefits (Kelley, et al, 1991).

(CDFG 1990) include screening Georgiana Slough and screening the Delta Cross Channel. A sound barrier (a device generating
subsurface sound that discourages fish from entering the Slough) at Georgiana Slough is currently under study and
may also be a useful implementation measure. As new methods are developed to increase smolt survival, their benefits
can be assessed, and their contribution toward meeting and/or revising the criteria taken into account.

Given this potential flexibility, EPA believes that establishing smolt survival indices as Fish Migration and Cold
Fresh-Water Habitat criteria would give the State Board maximum latitude in choosing a set of implementation methods
that will attain protection of the designated migration and coldwater fisheries uses. As such, these proposed criteria
are consistent with the mandates of section 101(g) of the CWA, as discussed above, and accommodate the State's interest
in allocating its water supplies in a way that maximizes the many values important to the State. Furthermore, the proposal
of these criteria is consistent with the authority in CWA section 303(c)(4), which authorizes EPA to propose revised
or new standards to meet the requirements of the Act.

e. Protection of Other Salmon Runs and Life Stages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the smolt survival indices were developed using tagged fall-run fish during the time of their outmigration,
EPA is proposing the use of these indices only for fall-run outmigrants. For winter-, late fall-, and spring-run salmon,
as well as steelhead, there is no direct information about the factors that affect survival, although it is likely
that many of the same factors, with the exception of temperatures during the colder months, are also affecting the
juveniles of these populations as they migrate through the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Measures implemented by the USBR and SWP as a result of the Biological Opinion for winter-run salmon issued by NMFS
under the ESA afford some protection for other runs, in addition to protection for the winter-run salmon population
itself. NMFS, Biological Opinion on Central Valley Project, 1992 Operations (February 14, 1992). In addition, EPA
has been consulting with NMFS to assure that the implementation of EPA's proposed standards will not jeopardize the
winter-run Chinook salmon population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Juvenile spring-run salmon and steelhead move through the Delta during the same period as winter-run and fall-run
salmon, and should be protected in the Delta by measures taken for these other runs. Late fall-run salmon, however,
outmigrate in fall and early winter, and are currently not fully protected during their passage through the Delta.
Protective criteria for this run should be developed by the State Board in the near future to ensure that this run is
protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Younger salmon, or fry, also enter the Delta, particularly when rainstorms stimulate the movement of fry out of the
tributaries and into the lower Rivers and Delta. Some protection for these fry is afforded by the current State Board
standards requiring closure of the Delta Cross Channel gates when flows are higher than 12,000 cfs. However, closure
of the Cross Channel gates alone may not be protective enough, since fry can be swept into the central Delta through
Georgiana Slough and upstream to the export pumps when there is reverse flow in the lower San Joaquin River, especially
during times of high export. For that reason, Delta habitat conditions for fry may need to be addressed by the State
Board in the future.

f. Protection of Other Migrating Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Species other than salmonids seasonally migrate into and out of the Delta for spawning and as juveniles. These species
include striped bass, Delta smelt, longfin smelt, white and green sturgeon, American shad and Sacramento splittail.
With the exception of temperature, the factors that lead to successful migration of salmonid smolts are also important
for successful migration of the juveniles of these species into the lower embayments. Therefore, EPA's proposed
salmon smolt survival criteria, although specifically addressing fall-run Chinook salmon, will also help protect
migration of these other migrating species.

a. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In California, striped bass spawn primarily in the warmer freshwater segments of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.
Protection of spawning in both river systems is important to ensure the genetic diversity of the population as well
as to increase the size of the overall striped bass population. Adults spawn by migrating upstream from the San Francisco
Bay or from the Pacific Ocean (Stevens 1979; Wang 1986). The precise location and time of spawning appear to be controlled
by temperature and salinity (Turner 1972a; Turner and Chadwick 1972). According to the California DFG, striped bass
spawn successfully only in freshwater with electrical conductivities less than 0.44 millimhos
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per centimeter electroconductivity (mmhos/cm EC), and prefer to spawn in waters with conductivities below 0.33
mmhos/cm. Conductivities greater than 0.55 mmhos/cm appear to block the upstream migration of adult spawners (Radtke
and Turner 1967; SWRCB 1987; CDFG 1990b, WQCP&hyph;DFG&hyph;4).

The salinity problems addressed by the isohaline criteria outlined above are caused primarily by salt water intrusion
and are traditionally measured by ``parts per thousand''. In contrast, salinity conditions upstream in freshwater
are generally affected by dissolved salts from upstream water runoff. The salinity content of freshwater is traditionally
measured by its electroconductivity or ``EC'' standardized to 25 C (specific conductance), and is expressed in terms
of millimhos per centimeter electroconductivity or ``mmhos/cm EC''.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Sacramento River, adults migrate to spawning sites upstream of Sacramento until they encounter the appropriate
warmer temperatures for spawning. Because of the higher volume of water in the Sacramento River and the particular
constituents and volume of nonpoint source discharges into the river, salinity does not appear to be a serious limitation
on spawning at any location along the river. In years of higher spring river flows, with correspondingly lower water
temperatures, bass can spawn further upstream and later in the April-June period because the warmer temperatures
that induce spawning occur later (Chadwick 1958). Migration and spawning in the Sacramento River are therefore not
adversely affected by salinity. In the smaller and shallower San Joaquin River, however, the earlier occurrence
of warm temperatures causes the peak spawning period to occur earlier than in the Sacramento River; the San Joaquin
peak usually occurs in April or May rather than in May or June (Chadwick 1958). Migrating bass seeking the warmer waters
encounter excessive upstream salinity caused primarily by runoff. This salinity can block migration up the San Joaquin
River, thereby reducing spawning, and can also reduce survival of eggs (Farley 1966; Radtke 1966; Radtke and Turner
1967; Turner and Farley 1971; Turner 1972a, 1972b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Board's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan established objectives of 1.5 mmhos/cm EC at Antioch and 0.44 mmhos/cm EC at
Prisoners Point in April and May. EPA disapproved these objectives, in part, because they are not adequate to protect
spawning habitat in the reach farther upstream between Prisoners Point and Vernalis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1987 State Board hearings, California DFG testified that striped bass formerly spawned farther up the San Joaquin
River, but that this has occurred less frequently in recent years because of increased salinity levels (CDFG 1987).
Salinity in the San Joaquin River increases upstream of Prisoners Point due to reduced freshwater inflow and agricultural
return flows. Thus the absence of salinity criteria above Prisoners Point effectively establishes a barrier to adult
migration and spawning farther upstream on the San Joaquin River (Turner 1972a,b). California DFG also suggested
that there was a danger of losing the part of the population that spawned in this area if high salinities prevent spawning
or decrease survival of newly spawned eggs (CDFG 1987; SWRCB. Phase I Hearing Transcript, LXXV, VII 111:3&hyph;14).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan, the State Board described several alternative water quality standards that would have
extended the protection of spawning conditions upstream of Prisoners Point, including one alternative very similar
to the one EPA is proposing today. However, the State Board deferred adoption of revised standards, apparently because
of concern that improved spawning conditions would lead to greater losses of young to entrainment at the State and
Federal pumping plants. As indicated in its September 3, 1991 letter disapproving certain State criteria, EPA believes
that the State Board can, in developing its implementation measures, address the impact of the pumps on this spawning
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also disapproved the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan spawning criteria because they were not based on sound science. The State
Board explained that the 1.5 mmhos/cm EC criteria at Antioch was intended to protect spawning habitat upstream of
Antioch (near Jersey Point), not at the Antioch location itself. The State Board acknowledged that ``the use of 1.5
[mmhos/cm] EC at Antioch appears not to be generally appropriate, and proposed that a thorough review of this [criteria]
be undertaken at the next triennial review'' (1991 Bay/Delta Plan, p. 5&hyph;32). EPA found this indirect and unproven
approach of setting criteria downstream in hopes of attaining different criteria upstream deficient, and disapproved
it. EPA's proposed criteria would correct this deficiency by establishing the scientifically-defensible criteria
at Jersey Point, the actual point of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Board also acknowledged that the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan spawning criteria did not protect the spawning reach
in the lower San Joaquin River, but instead only at two locations: Jersey Point and Prisoners Point (1991 Bay/Delta
Plan, p. 5&hyph;30). As a result, the State Board directed California DFG to study how a specific habitat zone of 0.44
mmhos/cm EC could be established in the entire reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners Point ``to make certain that
the State Board develops water quality objectives that are based on sound scientific data'' (1991 Bay/Delta Plan,
p. 5&hyph;33). EPA agrees, and is proposing criteria to assure that the entire reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners
Point should be protected.

b. Proposed Criteria

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its September 3, 1991 letter and subsequent correspondence with the Board, EPA recommended salinity criteria
of 0.44 mmhos/cm EC in the lower San Joaquin River in the reach from Jersey Point and Vernalis. After further reviewing
the scientific evidence, EPA is proposing the following criteria:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The 14-day running average of the mean daily EC shall not be more than 0.44 mmhos/cm for the period April 1 to May 31 in
wet, above normal, and below normal years at the following stations: Jersey Point, San Andreas Landing, Prisoners
Point, Buckley Cove, Rough and Ready Island, Brandt Bridge, Mossdale, and Vernalis. In dry and critical water years,
the criteria are required only in the reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners Point, as measured at Jersey Point,
San Andreas Landing, and Prisoners Point.

These criteria will fully protect the historic spawning range of striped bass on the lower San Joaquin River, while
reflecting the natural variability in salinity levels in different water year types.

c. Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the CWA, the states have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects
that the State Board would implement these criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements
included in water rights permits issued by the State Board.

4. Compliance With Endangered Species Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has concluded that its promulgation of water quality criteria for the Bay/Delta may affect certain species protected
by the federal ESA. These include the winter-run chinook salmon (listed as threatened and proposed for reclassification
as endangered), the Delta smelt (listed as threatened), and the Sacramento splittail and longfin smelt (both the
subject of petitions for listing). There are also a number of listed and proposed species resident in Suisun Marsh.
Under section 7 of the ESA and accompanying regulations, EPA is required to consult with NMFS (on the winter-run chinook
salmon) and USFWS (on the other listed and proposed species) to assure that the water quality criteria promulgated
by EPA do not jeopardize the continued existence of these species or adversely affect their critical habitat. 50 CFR
402.14 and &sect;402.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has worked closely with NMFS and USFWS over the past two years to meet its obligations under the ESA. The federal
agencies have recognized the need to take an integrated ecosystem approach to the Bay/Delta rather than a fragmented,
species-by-species approach. To that end, the EPA, NMFS, and USFWS issued a joint proposal to the State Board's 1992
hearings on interim measures recommending that the State Board adopt an immediate goal of restoration of habitat
conditions to those characteristic of the late 1960's and early 1970's. By targeting this level of protection, the
agencies intended to establish habitat conditions that would protect and preserve the entire range of fish and wildlife
uses in the Bay/Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria proposed in this notice follow this approach to habitat protection within the Bay/Delta watershed.
Pursuant to 50 CFR &sect;&sect;402.14, EPA has initiated formal consultations with USFWS and NMFS on the potential
effects of its action on endangered and threatened species. The agencies have agreed to finalize these consultations
before EPA promulgates water quality standards in the Bay/Delta.

D. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires EPA and other agencies to assess the potential costs and benefits of all significant
regulatory actions. Significant regulatory actions are those that impose a cost on the economy of $100 million or
more annually or have certain regulatory, policy, or economic impacts. Today's proposed rule meets the criteria
of a significant regulatory action set forth in section 3(f) of the Executive Order. The regulatory analysis for this
proposed rule is presented in ``Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Proposed Water Quality Standards for the
San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta'' (see Section F for the availability of this and other documents).
This draft RIA was submitted to OMB for review as required by the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's action is the proposal of water quality standards and this action explicitly does not include a proposed implementation
plan. The implementation plan has not yet been developed by the State. Therefore, this draft RIA analyses a range of
possible implementation scenarios. Importantly, the analysis illustrates that the level of costs for the same level
of environmental benefits varies significantly depending on assumptions in implementation scenarios. Specifically,
mechanisms for economically-efficient allocation of water or for the widespread distribution of responsibility,
such as water transfers and/or a drought water bank, result in the most cost-effective scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is committed to working with the State on an implementation plan and welcomes additional information and analysis
on the economic costs and benefits of its proposals. EPA is interested in both improved information and policies and
programs to minimize the economic impacts upon water users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft RIA evaluated the costs and benefits of the combined federal proposals, including EPA's proposed water
quality standards and USFWS's actions under the ESA. The primary method of implementation is assumed to be increased
Delta outflow resulting in reduced water supplies to urban and agricultural water users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, critical habitat designation may result in additional costs by possibly limiting sand and gravel operations
and affecting marina operations. Benefits are to the Delta ecosystem as a whole, species diversity, and commercial
and recreational fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Assessment of Costs and Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft RIA shows that the costs to both agricultural and urban water users would depend upon how water supplies are
allocated to implement the proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The primary method for implementing the combined federal proposals will be increases in Delta outflow. Current
estimates of the additional outflow developed by the California DWR are 540,000 acre-feet on average and 1.1 million
acre-feet in critically dry years.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The analysis uses an initial distribution of water supply reductions between agricultural users (80% of the
reductions) and urban users (the remaining 20%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of three scenarios analyzed are presented in the draft RIA and are briefly summarized here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Agricultural impacts are influenced by improved irrigation efficiency, crop shifting opportunities, the
size of the affected region and opportunities for water trading between agricultural districts. A range of these
options was modeled, except for irrigation efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A middle range distribution of supply impacts (Scenario 2) that includes water trading between agricultural
districts results in producer surplus losses (net revenue losses) of $20 million dollars on average. If trading is
limited (Scenario 1), impacts are estimated to be $44 million on average. Scenario 3 illustrates the lowest cost option,
distributing the water supply reductions throughout the Central Valley, resulting in producer surplus losses estimates
of $8 million on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Economic impacts were estimated for critically dry years and indicate larger economic impacts, because lower
cost options are already used up in drought years. Scenario 1, where trading is limited, estimates $147 million in
costs in critically dry years. Scenario 2, where trading is facilitated among agricultural districts, reduces those
impacts by nearly half to $87 million in impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential impacts on the urban users were more difficult to estimate, given the less-established analytic information
base. Three scenarios were developed to project the economic impacts based upon different assumptions and implementation
choices. Key implementation choices analyzed include the availability of transfers, drought water pricing, a drought
water bank and increased water reclamation. Additional water management choices include increased conservation,
conjunctive use and other demand management programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Water transfers and an efficient drought water bank are key to minimizing impacts on urban users, given increased
environmental needs. In the least-cost scenario, (Scenario 3) impacts on urban users were projected to be $25 million
on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under Scenario 2, where reclamation meets urban supply needs along with a combination of drought water pricing
and a more limited drought water bank, impacts are approximately $50&hyph;54 million on average. Under Scenario
1, where no drought water bank exists, impacts are projected at $80 million on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The economic impacts of the proposals are highest in drought years, when fewer supplies are available to meet
increased urban and environmental needs. Estimation of consumer surplus losses for Scenario 3 projects a continuation
of the 1991 drought water bank resulting in economic costs of $70 million in a critically dry year. A combination of
a more limited drought water bank and drought water pricing results in consumer surplus losses of $184&hyph;223 million
for Scenario 2. Scenario 1, where no drought water bank exists, results in consumer surplus losses of $450 million
in a critically dry year. However, EPA projects that these losses are not likely given the support for a drought water
bank as a drought management option. Further, consumer surplus losses do not measure water bill increases in the drought
case because consumers have demonstrated in drought periods that they change their water use practices rather than
pay higher rates. Accordingly, an undetermined portion of these estimates is the value of inconvenience and changes
in behavior during drought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the draft RIA also estimated employment impacts for agriculture associated with the implementation
of these proposals. The direct employment effects were estimated to be a reduction of 99 person-years on average,
but 1926 person-years in a critically dry year for Scenario 2 (water trading allowed between agricultural districts).
If water trading between agricultural districts is limited, employment impacts are estimated to be higher, with
828 person years on average and 3282 person years in a critically dry year. These estimates are not predicted employment
changes (e.g impacts that would effect the actual unemployment rate) because they do not account for a full labor market
equilibrium analysis.

Assessment of Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Background: The Bay/Delta estuary constitutes one of the largest habitats for fish and wildlife in the United States.
The estuary supports more than 120 fish species and provides a stopover or home for more than half of the waterfowl and
shorebirds migrating on the Pacific Flyway. Suisun Marsh, which is within the Bay/Delta estuary, supports many rare
plant and animal species. Maintenance of freshwater, estuarine, and wildlife habitat would preserve rare and endangered
species; permit fish migration; and provide opportunities for commercial ocean fishing and sport fishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualitative assessment: The combined proposed requirements will increase the protection of the estuarine habitat
in the Delta and will benefit the ecosystem overall. In addition, the combined proposal is expected to increase biological
productivity of such important resources as salmon, striped bass, and waterfowl; protect diversity of species,
such as Delta smelt, longfin smelt and Sacramento splittail, that are unique to the Bay/Delta ecosystem; increase
commercial and recreational fishing opportunities; and increase opportunities for wildlife observation resulting
from restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits associated with the federal proposals are described qualitatively for most ecosystem benefits. Some fish
population increases were estimated and a portion of the commercial and recreational fishery benefits were monetized.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The benefits of the federal proposals are an increase in biological productivity and ecosystem health for
the Bay/Delta ecosystem. This increase includes protecting unique species from extinction. Bay/Delta species
that currently might qualify for listing under the ESA include the longfin smelt, spring-run Chinook salmon, Sacramento
splittail, green sturgeon, and Red Hills Roach, in addition to the already listed winter-run Chinook salmon and Delta
smelt. A potential benefit of the federal proposals is that the ecosystem health might improve to the point where unlisted
species need not be listed, or presently listed species could be delisted under the ESA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Well-established relationships between estuarine conditions and populations exist for many estuarine
species. The extent of the low salinity habitat in the estuary is closely associated with the abundance and distribution
of estuarine species at all trophic levels. Increased populations were estimated for salmon (increasing by approximately
90,000 salmon), striped bass (increasing by approximately 10 percent), and starry flounder. In addition, populations
of other game species of green and white sturgeon, bay shrimp, American shad and white catfish are expected to increase.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A portion of these population increases will accrue to the recreational or commercial fisheries. Not less
than $9&hyph;11 million annually were estimated, again with many benefits not estimated in dollar value. The majority
of these gains are in the commercial salmon fishery. Employment gains in the salmon fishery were estimated to increase
by 300&hyph;360 jobs annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Many other recreation activities, including hunting, boating, and nature appreciation are expected to be
enhanced by the proposed regulations; however, the estimated change in participation in these activities could
not be quantified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enhancing the natural environment of the Bay/Delta would have nonuse social benefits. Although these benefits
could not be quantified, it is believed that they constitute the largest portion of the total value to society of implementing
the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enhancing water quality in the Bay/Delta could result in other benefits associated with the avoidance of listing
additional species and associated increased flexibility in water management and the avoided costs of further collapse
of the ecosystem and its associated fisheries and dependent communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Costs and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monetized social costs and benefits of the federal proposals are not directly comparable in this analysis because
some use benefits to fisheries and non-use benefits of ecological improvement and species diversity cannot be estimated.
However, two conclusions can be drawn: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The implementation plan for the federal proposals has not yet been developed, thereby making it difficult
to project actual levels of economic impacts. However, it is reasonable to assume that cost-effective solutions
will be pursued that include a flexible approach to meeting Delta requirements. Thus, economic costs in the agricultural
sector are estimated to be $20 million on average and $25 million for the urban sector. However, the overall costs may
be lower than the total, given that at least some of the increases in urban costs will be payments to agriculture for
water transferred. The benefits are estimated to be $10 million from improved commercial fisheries, and unquantified
but important ecological, scientific, educational and existence values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Costs and benefits are difficult to compare directly in this case because of the non-marginal nature of ecosystem
protection and species protection. These benefits, including preventing the extinction of several candidate or
listed species and preventing the collapse of the Bay/Delta ecosystem, account for the majority of benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Given both the monetary estimates of benefits and the qualitative information on benefits not expressed in
dollar value, EPA believes that the proposal can be implemented in a cost-effective manner where a healthy estuary
and fisheries can co-exist with a strong agricultural and urban sector. Given all the available information, the
benefits are commensurate with the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Comprehensive analyses of the incremental response of costs and benefits to marginal changes in EPA's proposed
rule have not been prepared. However, EPA has developed in the draft RIA a method for roughly estimating incremental
changes in economic costs based on changes in the number of days of compliance with the proposed salinity criteria
at particular locations in the estuary. These estimates are based on the estimates of the flows necessary to maintain
the criteria at the target locations. For example, the difference in water supply impacts between a day of protection
at Chipps Island and a day of protection at the Confluence is 12,276 AF/year. These estimates of the difference in water
supply impact can be compared to the dollar value of that water, which the draft RIA estimates as being $90 per AF.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;601, et seq., requires EPA and other federal agencies to prepare an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IFRA). EPA's internal guidelines require that an IFRA include a profile
of the small entities and determine if the statutory authority allows consideration of alternative implementation
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the action does not allow consideration of alternative implementation actions. First, under
the Clean Water Act, water quality criteria must be based solely on science. Second, EPA is promulgating water quality
criteria that in effect supplement state criteria that fail to meet the requirements of the CWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Minimizing the impacts on small farms can be accomplished by developing the least costly implementation plan,
which distributes water supply reductions widely and facilitates trading between water districts. Given that allocation
of water at the farm level depends primarily on decisions at the irrigation district level, determining which size
farm would experience water supply impacts will also be difficult at the State level.

Written public comments are invited on all issues raised in this notice. EPA is especially interested in soliciting
public comments on the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA requests comments on the feasibility of setting water quality criteria based on a smooth function rather than
on the mean value for each water year type categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony at recent State Board hearings criticized the use of water year type categories. Because water year types
can change as the year progresses, criteria based on the historical mean for each water year type can cause major changes
in project operations and habitat conditions if a given year shifts from one water year type to another. For example,
a later season storm could cause the water year type to be reclassified from the below normal category to the above normal
category. This shift would increase the number of required days of compliance at Chipps Island from 119 to 144 days.
Such large and sudden changes are inefficient for water resource management and can harm aquatic resources by dewatering
or washing away newly spawned eggs. One formulation of the criteria that could provide for more gradual shifts is described
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California DWR, USBR, and others have suggested that a smooth function should replace the use of means for each water
year type category. Use of these smooth function equations would result in the same average number of days required
for each year type but would involve higher numbers in wetter years within the category and lower numbers for the drier
years within each category. Incorporation of a smooth function would likely ease the actual operational procedure
to meet the criteria and would avoid the relatively large scale changes in operations that might come from a shift in
the determination of year type as spring progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has discussed the use of a smooth function criteria with water project operators and the State Board, and has thus
far received a very positive response. Because it is a new approach that has not received substantial scrutiny in California,
EPA's proposal above relies on the traditional water year type classification. However, if public comments do not
raise any significant issues preventing its use, EPA would be inclined to use the smooth function criteria as an alternative
to the water year type classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below describes one possible approach to the construction of a smooth function criteria, and compares
the potential effects of those functions with the traditional water year type criteria. Because no critically dry
years occurred in the reference period it is necessary to extrapolate from the four year types for which there are data
to the critical year type. Fortunately, there is a very high correlation among the four points (Figs. 1 and 2). These
extrapolations allow the required number of days at Roe and Chipps Islands in each year type to be described as a pair
of smooth functions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This equation produces a wide range of required number of days within most year types and in all but wet years would involve
a range of about thirty days. Use of the equation would result in little variance within wet years.

The relationship between number of days at Port Chicago and Sacramento Basin Index (Figure 3) yields differences
of required number of days within year types of as much as 40 days in dry years. With the difference in flows required
to sustain the isohaline at Port Chicago (29,000 cfs) and Chipps Island (12,000 cfs), the theoretical difference
in water costs within a year type could be substantial. The actual costs are likely to be lower, however, because flows
sufficient to trigger the standard are often followed by a considerable period of elevated flows sufficient to meet
the required number of days. These differences are likely to be fully realized in dry and critical years when conditions
in the Delta are fully controlled by the projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relationship between number of days at Chipps Island and Sacramento Basin Index (Figure 4) yields very small ranges
about the mean for all but critical years. However, use of a smooth function is justified because of the open-ended
nature of critical years. The driest year on record had a Sacramento Basin Index of 3.1, but the index theoretically
could approach 0. This wide span of possible index values in the critical year type is best handled by the smooth function
described. The smaller flows this standard entails (12,000 cfs at Chipps and 5,800 cfs at the confluence) and the small
range of values within all but critical year types yields smaller differences in water costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, a smooth function to determine the number of days of compliance would result in the same average number
of days for each year type, but would more accurately reflect differences within these categories. Hence, small adjustments
could be made in project operations as the water year progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of a smooth function addresses, to some extent, the issue of adjusting habitat protection requirements in
extended droughts. The present identification of year type is based on the Sacramento River Index. That index combines
three variables: (1) Precipitation in the April through September period when flood control requirements are reduced
and more precipitation can be held in reservoirs, (2) the index of the previous year which partly reflects the amount
of carry-over storage, and (3) precipitation in the October through March period. The index weights these three factors
in a 40:30:30 ratio. For the purpose of protecting estuarine habitat, the precipitation in February to June and the
amount of carry-over storage may be more important than precipitation in the rest of the year. EPA is requesting comments
on the possibility of modifying the Sacramento River Index for purposes of developing the salinity criteria as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The criteria could calculate an index weighted more toward the previous year's Sacramento River Index and the
February through June precipitation. A 40:40:20 ratio or even 50:50:0 index might be a more appropriate basis for
the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The criteria could start each February with a baseline set of requirements and add or subtract days at each of the
two downstream sites based on how conditions in each month differ from the average conditions for that month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA is including a 14 day rolling averaging period in its proposed salinity criteria. As discussed above, the 14
day period was included to assure that the range of spring to neap tidal conditions was included in the averaging period.
Accounting for the effects of tidal influences is important, especially for the downstream compliance location
at Roe Island. During its discussions of this proposal with the operators of California's major water projects, it
was suggested that a 28 day rolling average or other averaging period may be more appropriate, so that the entire tidal
cycle is included. EPA's preliminary review of this suggestion indicates that it would be an appropriate device for
accounting for tidal influences, and would not have any detrimental impact on protecting the designated Estuarine
Habitat use. Therefore, if public comments do not raise any significant issues, EPA would be inclined to use a 28 day
averaging period. EPA, therefore, is requesting comments on the following alternative approaches to the averaging
period: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The proposed criteria could be measured using a 28 day rolling average, thereby lengthening the averaging period
to encompass the full range of tidal strengths and giving an overall effect of the tidal cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The criteria could measure compliance with a rolling average but allow discontinuities in the averaging period.
Thus, days on which meteorological conditions interfere with achieving the 2 ppt criteria at Roe Island would be counted
instead as days of meeting the criteria upstream at Chipps Island. This approach could be applied only until all days
that are required at the upstream site are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. As a part of EPA's coordination process in developing this proposal, the Agency has discussed its proposed criteria
at length with the operators of California's major water projects. These operators, who will have substantial responsibilities
under any implementation plan developed by the State Board, raised a question about how compliance with the 2 ppt salinity
criteria should be measured. Under existing operational models, these operators would translate the proposed criteria
into a set of flow parameters, and would operate the system pursuant to those flow parameters so as to achieve the 2 ppt
salinity criteria at the targeted sites. However, because all models contain imperfections, it has been proposed
that the operators should actually model compliance at a site somewhat downstream of the targeted site so as to provide
a ``margin of error'' or a ``confidence interval''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's preliminary review of this issue suggests that use of a ``confidence interval'' of this kind is unwarranted,
for two primary reasons. First, the model that predicts the location of the 2 ppt isohaline based on flows is extremely
accurate. EPA's preliminary review of the model's accuracy during the five months covered by the proposed salinity
criteria, using historical data, found that the model correctly predicts the number of days for the isohaline position
more than 95 percent of the time. Second, the use of a 28 day averaging period, as described above, would adequately
address most of the variability associated with factors not included in the salinity-flow model. For these reasons,
EPA believes that the use of these proposed confidence intervals would require substantial additional flows through
the estuary without any corresponding ecological benefit to the Estuarine Habitat designated use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that the State Board will develop an implementation plan for these Estuarine Habitat criteria by changing
the volume and timing of water flows through the estuary. EPA believes that an implementation plan that relies on the
salinity-flow model, without making additional allowances for confidence intervals as described above, would
be acceptable for purposes of protecting the designated use. Further, EPA notes that the State's triennial review
provides a mechanism for regularly reviewing the adequacy of any implementation decisions concerning confidence
intervals for the proposed salinity criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comment from the public on this issue, and welcomes any evaluation on the merits of the use of this or other
forms of confidence intervals with the proposed criteria. Specifically, EPA requests comment on whether the proposed
criteria without the above confidence interval adjustment would be protective. Alternatively, would a confidence
interval based on an extended number of days of compliance at the targeted sites yield the desired level of confidence
without requiring the higher flows required by the confidence interval proposal outlined above? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Will these criteria be adequate to protect low-salinity habitat conditions in wetter years? The SFEP workshop
that developed the scientific rationale for an estuarine index based their conclusions on correlations between
mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline during appropriate months and the abundance of estuarine organisms at all trophic
levels. With the exception of mollusks, yearly measures of abundance increase either linearly or logarithmically
as the mean location of the 2 ppt isohaline moves down the estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has developed its proposed Estuarine Habitat criteria based on the number of days at particular locations in the
estuary, rather than a mean position over a series of months. These criteria have the advantage of being more easily
implemented, and more directly tie certain salinity ranges to certain geographic locations (such as the extensive
shallows of Grizzly Bay). However, basing the number of days on a certain historical period (such as 1940 to 1975) does
not mean that the mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline for these reference years will be achieved. By using the historical
period of 1940 to 1975 to define the number of days at each location, we are approximating the actual historical (late
1960's to early 1970's) mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline in drier years. However, EPA's criteria may not provide
overall conditions equal to those during the late 1960's to early 1970's. This is because the mean position of the 2
ppt isohaline in wetter years has been substantially downstream of the wetter year positions in the proposed rule
(see Table below).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
These wetter years are an important component of the natural hydrology; 40 percent of the last 50 years have been in
the ``wet'' category. They are years of very high productivity for the estuary, and are likely to provide a buffer for
times of low productivity, especially for those species living longer than one or two years. Such variability also
encourages diversity, such as the plant diversity in brackish tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay. While many of the
winter/spring flows during these years are presently considered ``uncontrollable,'' a number of new water projects
have been proposed that would capture part of these flows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One concern about the future development of these ``uncontrolled'' flows involves a possible decrease in the frequency
with which triggering conditions will occur. The level of protection afforded by the Roe Island standard would be
reduced if additional upstream water developments decrease uncontrolled wintertime flows, thus reducing the frequency
with which the standard is triggered. EPA welcomes comments on how this standard should be modified to reflect future
changes in upstream water development facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional concern about the protection of conditions in wetter years is that some wet years are much more productive
than others. By developing standards that can be met in all wet years some of the biological values associated with
exceptional years is not included. Part of the difficulty of developing criteria to protect the biological value
of these wetter years arises from the open-ended nature of the wet year category. Recent wet years include years as
different as 1983 and 1986. In 1983, precipitation, both rain and snow, was heavy throughout the winter and spring.
In 1986, on the other hand, a large tropical storm produced record-setting precipitation which lasted for a brief
period and fell almost entirely as rain. Although both these were wet years, 1983 had about three times the amount of
precipitation of 1986 and, because of the heavy snowfall, a much higher amount of water was available for use. Possible
ways to protect the value of wet year habitats include the use of triggered standards downstream of Roe Island or by
requiring more days at Roe Island in the wettest years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA welcomes suggestions on the proper level of protection that should be provided during these wetter periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One of the critical elements of EPA's proposal is the determination of the proper historical reference period for
developing target numbers of days when the 2 ppt isohaline is at a particular point in the estuary. As discussed above,
EPA is recommending a level of protection for the Bay/Delta similar to that existing during the late 1960's to early
1970's. To estimate the hydrological conditions during the late 1960's to early 1970's across the five water year
categories, EPA is proposing using the 1940 to 1975 period as the historical reference period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of years to include in the historical reference period can strongly affect the number of days when the 2 ppt
isohaline is at a particular point. Incremental changes in the number of days have corresponding incremental effects
on the water supply impacts of these proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the building of Shasta Dam, uncontrolled spring runoffs resulted in as many as 150 days when the 2 ppt isohaline
was located at or below Chipps Island, even in critical years, whereas in recent years there have been as few as 0 days.
In developing the proposed rule, EPA has used the period between October 1939 and September 1975 to represent the period
when the conditions in the estuary were sufficient to protect the designated fisheries uses. As explained above,
this span of years provides the greatest number of examples of each year type during the period after the massive changes
in hydrology due to the construction of the Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and the Friant Dam on the San Joaquin but
before the most dramatic recent declines in fishery abundance. Even so, the chosen historical reference period contains
no examples of critical years and only three examples of above normal years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One example of the variability of conditions within the chosen historical reference period involves the Chipps Island
location. There is a great deal of variability in the number of days the 2 ppt isohaline was at Chipps Island within each
of the drier year types in the historical reference period. Although the years with fewest days occurs later in the
period there are examples of later years with more days than earlier years. The following table gives the number of
days that the 2 ppt isohaline was west of Chipps Island for each dry and below normal year in the historical period. The
latest examples of dry years in the proposed reference period, 1964 and 1961, had the fewest days at Chipps Island.
These two dry years, however, were immediately preceded by a dry year (1960) with a number of days at Chipps Island substantially
greater than the historical mean, and the year with the third lowest number of days at Chipps actually occurred in 1947.
The absence of a strong pattern of decreasing days at Chipps Island over time was the principal basis for EPA's use of
as broad a historical period as possible, the full period from 1940 to 1975, as the historical reference period.

During the development of EPA's proposal, it has been suggested that the years 1964 to 1976 could be used as an alternative
historical reference period. This period almost literally replicates the intended late 1960's to early 1970's.
EPA has not chosen that period for two reasons. First, it is an extremely limited sample of the variation of conditions
within water year categories. Second, including the year 1976 is inappropriate, given that by 1976 the decline of
certain aquatic resources was already apparent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another suggested possibility is that use of the 1955 to 1975 time period may be a better indicator of conditions in
the late 1960's to early 1970's. The 1955&hyph;1975 period excludes water years before the CVP's pumping facilities
were operational, but still provides a larger sample across certain water year types than would using the 1965 to 1974
period alone. As the table above indicates, using this 1955 to 1975 period would decrease the number of Chipps Island
days from 116 to approximately 104 days during dry years, and from 119 to approximately 104 days during below normal
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not use this 1955&hyph;1975 period as the historical reference period because, as explained above, it believes
the 1940 to 1975 period provides a larger and more representative sample of hydrological conditions across all year
types similar to those in the late 1960's to early 1970's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the importance of this issue, EPA requests comments on the suitability of the above suggestions or of other historical
reference periods for the salinity criteria. EPA is especially interested in how the use of alternative periods could
provide a better estimate of the hydrological and ecological conditions in the estuary in the late 1960's to early
1970's. In addition, EPA is soliciting comment on alternative approaches to developing reference conditions for
water year types for which there are limited historical examples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. During the spawning season, several species appear to be carried through the Delta to Suisun Bay during periods
of elevated Delta flows caused by upstream storm events. The proposed Roe Island salinity criteria are partly intended
to protect the normal dispersal of these young fish throughout Suisun Bay over a number of tidal cycles. As explained
in more detail above, the proposed Roe Island criteria include a ``trigger'' that activates the criteria only after
natural hydrological conditions push the 2 ppt isohaline to Roe Island. EPA is requesting comment on this trigger,
including comment on the following specific questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would a trigger at some upstream site, such as Middle Ground, retain the desired link to storm events while ensuring
a more frequent triggering of the standard? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should the criteria be triggered only by storm events actually occurring in the February through June period?
This refinement would prevent the criteria from being triggered, for example, solely by a large storm occurring in
January, the runoff from which may keep the 2 ppt isohaline below Roe Island into February. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Should the trigger be stated as a single day when mean salinities are less than 2 ppt, or by a longer averaging period
(14 days, 28 days, etc.)?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(d) It has been suggested that the need for a trigger might be eliminated by setting a criteria at a location further
upstream. Both USFWS and USBR have suggested developing a criteria at Middle Ground (at roughly km 68). At this location
the criteria would be triggered in all but critical years and would thereby provide an increased level of protection
overall. Even though a Middle Ground criteria would require more days of protection than the Roe Island criteria,
the upstream location means that the water supply impacts would be less than for the Roe Island criteria in years when
the Roe Island criteria would have applied. It is likely that a shift of the downstream requirement from Roe Island
to Middle Ground would have higher water supply impacts on average but lower impacts in particular years. At the same
time, however, this shift in the downstream location would mean that the criteria would no longer be directly tied
to salinities in San Pablo Bay that have been identified as biologically important for starry flounder, longfin smelt,
and the shrimp,

Crangon franciscorum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Several participants in the State Board hearings stressed the importance of avoiding consecutive years of poor
habitat conditions for short-lived species, such as Delta smelt and longfin smelt. For example, Dr. Moyle recommended
that relaxations of the Roe Island standards to Chipps Island during dry and critical years be limited to two consecutive
years. Similarly, during the course of the Agency's discussions with USFWS and NMFS about the potential effects of
these proposed criteria on threatened and endangered species, a question was raised about whether the proposed criteria
would adequately protect the listed Delta smelt in an extended drought. Recent extended droughts in the Bay/Delta
watershed have lasted six or seven years, but there is scientific evidence that droughts as long as fifty years have
occurred and could happen again. Although droughts of this magnitude are unlikely, such a drought would have serious
adverse impacts on the estuary's fisheries resources, and especially on fishes with short life cycles such as the
Delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, water project operators have suggested that extended droughts impose special constraints on project
operations and deliveries, and have recommended that EPA propose relaxations of the Estuarine Habitat criteria
during extended droughts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comments on whether it is necessary to promulgate special criteria to deal with the issue of consecutive
dry or critical years or extended drought. EPA is particularly interested in comments on the biological requirements
of threatened and endangered fishes during these periods, and on the operational impacts of special protection measures
during these periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In this proposed rule, EPA is relying on the Estuarine Habitat criteria to protect the tidal wetlands bordering
Suisun Bay. Tidal wetlands provide habitat for diverse marsh, aquatic and wildlife species, as well as special status
species such as the Suisun song sparrow, Delta tule pea, black rail, clapper rail and soft-haired bird's beak. EPA's
proposed criteria have been developed to protect aquatic species and to provide salinity conditions similar to those
in the late 1960's to early 1970's. Therefore, many of the aquatic species that inhabit the marsh channels should be
better protected under our proposed criteria. In addition, the proposed Estuarine Habitat criteria are designed
to provide substantially better dry and critically dry year springtime conditions than the recent year conditions
that have caused adverse effects on the tidal marsh communities bordering Suisun Bay. EPA therefore believes that
these criteria will provide substantially better conditions in the marshes, but is soliciting comment as to whether
additional criteria are necessary to fully protect the marsh resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA does not believe that there is a sufficient scientific record at this time to establish specific numerical
salinity criteria for the tidal wetlands, it may be possible to set narrative criteria which could be developed into
numerical criteria in the near future as additional information becomes available. To be consistent with EPA guidance,
such narrative criteria should include specific language about conditions that must exist to protect a designated
use, and must be quantifiable so that numeric standards can be developed (USEPA, 1990). Examples of possible narrative
criteria for the Suisun Marsh are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``Water quality conditions sufficient to support high plant diversity and diverse wildlife habitat throughout
all elevations of the tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``Water quality conditions sufficient to assure survival and growth of brackish marsh plants dependent on soils
low in salt content (especially Scirpus californicus

 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus acutus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in sufficient numbers to support Suisun song sparrow habitat in shoreline marshes and interior marsh channel margins
bordering Suisun Bay.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA welcomes any information or recommendations on criteria to protect the Suisun Bay tidal marshes.

9. USFWS and NMFS have expressed concern that special measures may be necessary to protect Delta smelt in the event
of a late spawn. In particular, these agencies have suggested that if real-time monitoring indicates that peak Delta
smelt spawning occurs in late June or July, it might be appropriate to maintain the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay during
those months to assure that juveniles remain in the suitable rearing habitat in eastern Suisun Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comment as to whether and how these measures should be incorporated into water quality criteria,
and on the operational impacts of such criteria. In addition, EPA requests comment on how implementation of these
criteria would affect carryover storage requirements presently imposed on water projects for the benefit of the
threatened winter-run Chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. EPA is proposing salmon smolt survival criteria to protect the Cold Fresh-Water Habitat and Fish Migration designated
uses. These criteria would address EPA's concerns with certain temperature criteria contained in the 1991 Bay/Delta
Plan that were disapproved by EPA. As explained in more detail above, the Agency believes that it presently has an inadequate
basis to propose temperature criteria. Further, the adoption of salmon smolt criteria provides the State with more
flexibility in determining an implementation plan protecting the fisheries use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting comment as to whether an adequate scientific basis exists to propose a temperature criteria alone.
The Agency is especially interested in receiving comment as to whether a temperature criteria would provide better
protection for the designated uses than the proposed criteria, and whether a temperature criteria could be implemented
given the present operational flexibility in the estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. EPA welcomes any additional information on the effectiveness and feasibility of installing a barrier to fish
(including a sound barrier) at the head of Georgiana Slough. Results from USFWS coded-wire salmon smolt experiments
clearly demonstrate that migrating smolts survive poorly in the central Delta, and salmon smolt survival would be
higher if fish migrated down the main Sacramento River channel. Closure of Georgiana Slough is one of the implementation
measures that the Delta Team of the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee evaluated and recommended as a measure to
increase salmon smolt survival, and survival indices recommended by the fisheries agencies included this measure.
The major concerns over Georgiana Slough closure are: exacerbation of the reverse flow situation in the lower San
Joaquin River, degradation of water quality conditions in the Central Delta, and blocking of upstream migration
of adult salmon. It is likely that reverse flows would become less of a problem with a barrier in place in Georgiana Slough
if exports were balanced with San Joaquin River flows to continue to provide positive flows in the lower San Joaquin.
EPA would like more information on whether a balance could be achieved to provide some periods of time when a Georgiana
Slough barrier would be beneficial for salmon without causing detrimental effects on the other species and habitats
in the Delta. Since EPA's proposed salmon smolt survival index is a criteria to protect the outmigration of smolts,
and Georgiana Slough closure is a measure that would be beneficial for outmigrating salmon, EPA solicits comments
on whether the target index values in its proposal should be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. As explained in more detail above, EPA has based its proposed index values for the salmon smolt survival criteria
for the San Joaquin River on recommendations by the USFWS, NMFS and California DFG at the State Board's Interim Water
Rights Hearings for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. These recommendations include
placing a barrier at the head of Old River during migration of San Joaquin River system smolts through the Delta (April
1 until May 31). The Old River barrier was also recommended by the Delta Team of the Five Agency Chinook Salmon Committee,
and is one of the projects called for in the CVP Improvement Act. However, discussions with USWFS and NMFS carried out
during EPA's consultations under the ESA have raised questions about whether the barrier would adversely affect
reverse flows in the central Delta under certain conditions. EPA is therefore requesting comment on the following
issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would the proposed salmon smolt criteria index values on the San Joaquin need to be revised if the Old River barrier
is not built? In what ways? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should EPA promulgate alternative or additional criteria that would be effective in the event that the Old River
barrier is not constructed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. In addition to a barrier at the head of Old River, the USFWS implementation recommendations for the San Joaquin
also included certain export limits and flow requirements during peak migration periods. Export limits are also
an important measure for achieving protection for migrating smolts on the Sacramento River system, especially if
there is no barrier in place at Georgiana Slough, and are an element of the models used to generate the salmon smolt survival
indices on the Sacramento River. EPA is concerned that there may be implementation scenarios for the two rivers that
could result in detrimental conditions for migrating smolts even if the proposed index values are achieved. One such
possible scenario may occur if the State Board adopts USFWS implementation recommendations on the Sacramento River
(adjusted, as described above, to account for Georgiana Slough remaining open), but then operates the San Joaquin
River so as to just meet the proposed index values. In this case, our preliminary review indicates that the San Joaquin
River index value theoretically might be attained with lower flows than are protective for the salmon resources.
The USFWS has substantial evidence that San Joaquin River flows are a critical element for successful smolt migration.
Protection of migration for these runs is particularly important considering the low abundances and poor conditions
in the San Joaquin system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion above raises the possibility that the salmon smolt criteria for the San Joaquin River system may need
to be refined. We are therefore requesting comment as to whether the proposed index values should be revised to reflect
the interrelation between Sacramento River and San Joaquin River implementation measures recommended by USFWS.
In particular, should the proposed index values be revised to account for the possible effects of low flow scenarios
on the San Joaquin River?

14. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act requires that measures be taken to double the production of anadromous
fish species throughout the Central Valley watershed. EPA intends that its proposed criteria should support this
goal in the waters of the Bay/Delta estuary. EPA appreciates any information on whether the proposed criteria provide
the necessary protection to reach this goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Dr. Wim Kimmerer has developed a salmon population model for the Sacramento River Basin, CPOP, which includes
a regression model for the Delta based on the same USFWS data used to develop EPA's proposed criteria (BioSystems Analysis,
1989). This model is not divided into reaches, and uses all coded wire tag data from both ocean and trawl recoveries.
Significant independent variables include: proportion of flow remaining in Sacramento River, flow in the Sacramento
River, the interaction between these two, and temperature at Freeport. Dr. Kimmerer compares his analysis with the
USFWS analysis, and reports that his analysis outperforms the USFWS analysis and, in addition, that it better models
temperature effects on mortality. However, this model uses only pre-1989 data. EPA appreciates any comments on the
usefulness of this model in predicting Sacramento River smolt survival and setting criteria to protect Fish Migration
as a designated use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. A number of species in the Bay/Delta estuary appear to rely on estuarine conditions during the months of July to
January. These species include herring (primarily a Bay species), late fall-run salmon, and juvenile striped bass.
EPA welcomes any information on habitat conditions necessary for protection of these species, and on possible revisions
to the proposed criteria that could address these species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. EPA is concerned that changes in water project operations in response to the proposed criteria may have unforeseen
environmental impacts. EPA welcomes comments as to whether there are any operational scenarios for the CVP, SWP,
and/or other water users that would increase or decrease the ecological benefits of the proposed criteria. In addition,
EPA notes that, under the CWA, the state will conduct triennial reviews of these and other water quality criteria to
determine whether they are adequate to protect the designated uses. At those times, the state has the opportunity
to adjust criteria that are shown to be over or under protective of the uses. EPA welcomes comments as to the kinds of
information, such as biological resource monitoring data, that are or will be available to measure the effectiveness
of fish and wildlife criteria in the Bay/Delta.

Aquatic resources of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and upper portions of San Francisco Bay have undergone significant
declines over the past several decades. Species characteristic of the Delta and rivers, such as striped bass and salmon,
began to decline during the late 1970s. Prolonged drought, large diversions of fresh water, and dramatic increases
in populations of introduced aquatic species during the 1980s and 1990s brought a number of indigenous aquatic species
to extremely low levels. Species that spend more of their lives downstream of the Delta, including Delta smelt, longfin
smelt, and many zooplankton, maintained large populations through the 1970s, but declined sharply after the mid-1980s.
Declines in aquatic resources have led to curtailed fishing seasons, to petitions for endangered species status,
and general concern about the health of the estuarine ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern over the impacts of increased salinity produced from the combination of drought and high diversion rates
is not limited to aquatic communities. The few remaining fragments of brackish and freshwater tidal marshlands are
particularly vulnerable to increased salinity or to reduced variability in salinity. Under natural conditions,
these tidal marsh communities would move upstream with the changing salinity. But the flood plains and other lowlands
suitable for the evolution of tidal marshes are absent upstream. Tidal marshes provide important habitat for numerous
plants and animals of special concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large demands for water by the agricultural community and by California's burgeoning urban areas make it difficult
to allocate additional freshwater for the protection of dwindling aquatic and wetland resources of the estuary.
Management of the State's water resources necessitates a delicate balancing of needs, given the intense and growing
competition for water. If the freshwater needs of the estuary are to be considered seriously they must be based on sensitive,
straightforward, and diagnostic indicators of the responses of the estuarine ecosystem to patterns of freshwater
inflow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An extensive body of scientific evidence indicates that flows into, within, and through the estuary are extremely
important to organisms that depend on the estuary for at least a portion of their life cycles. However, the mechanisms
by which flows affect different elements of the ecosystem are not well understood. In the Bay/Delta Estuary, many
chemical and physical properties and processes are tightly linked to flow, including proportion of water diverted,
salinity at a given point, the longitudinal position of a particular salinity range, and alteration of the effects
of toxicants through dilutions. Any of these phenomena could be controlling a particular species, but each will also
vary with the other variables that are closely correlated with flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the complex configuration of the Delta and the estuary, combined with the complex withdrawal and diversion
network, preclude any simple, directly monitored measure of freshwater discharge to the estuary. Effective protection
and management of the estuary requires an index of the estuary's response to freshwater inflow that (1) Can be measured
accurately, easily and inexpensively; (2) has ecological significance; and (3) has meaning for nonspecialists.
Net Delta outflow, which is calculated from various measures and estimates of water inflow and use, has been a useful
tool but it does not satisfy all of these requirements. Because of the high correlations among the flow-related variables,
the choice of a suitable index does not need to be based on any presumed mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Francisco Estuary Project convened a series of technical workshops to evaluate the responses of estuarine
biota and habitats to various conditions of salinity and flow. The workshops involved approximately 30 scientists
and policy makers with expertise in estuarine oceanography and ecology, and in water and living resource management.
The group focused its attention on the Suisun Bay area, the portion of the estuary downstream of the confluence of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and upstream of Carquinez Strait. Internal Delta issues (such as gate closures,
water exports, and internal flows) or problems of downstream portions of the San Francisco Bay (such as urban and industrial
discharges) were not directly addressed by the group. No attempt was made to incorporate all management actions that
might benefit biological communities, nor to identify what level of environmental restoration and protection should
be set based on salinity and flow.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of freshwater needs of aquatic resources has caused conflict for a variety of reasons. Debate of scientific
issues is fundamentally different from other kinds of debate in that it should yield to scientific investigation.
Participants developed issue papers that delineated areas of scientific agreement. Several issue papers showed
that conditions in Suisun Bay largely reflected the abundance, recruitment, or survival not only of local species,
but also of habitat conditions for species upstream and downstream. A primary result of the issue papers produced
for this group was that almost all species studied increased in abundance as a simple function of increased outflow
and decreased salinity. The absence of a plateau or peak in the relationship of species abundances and outflow conditions
means that science alone cannot identify an optimal outflow. Furthermore, the similar response of species at all
ecological (trophic) levels argues strongly that the estuary should be managed using an ecosystem approach rather
than on a species by species basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical workshops concentrated on developing the scientific rationale for an estuarine index to measure the
estuary's response to different levels and patterns of freshwater input. Participants recognized that economic
and socio-political considerations should be accounted for at other points in the deliberations. The needs of society,
as well as the needs of the environment, should be considered in determining appropriate allocations of freshwater.
However, the premise of the workshops was that one should start with the best scientific and technical judgements
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many large-scale changes in the structure of the Delta have been proposed to facilitate water use and to reduce impacts
of water withdrawal on aquatic resources. There was general recognition by the group that the present Delta withdrawal
and distribution system is a major contributor to the declines of important species. The conclusion and recommendations
of the workshops are based upon the present water withdrawal and distribution system and would need to be re-evaluated
if any significant alterations to that system are considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusions and recommendations in this report were developed by the estuarine scientists and managers who participated
in one or more of the workshops. The complete list of participants and their affiliations are listed in Appendix D.
All conclusions and recommendations in this report were reviewed, voted on, and endorsed by a consensus of the estuarine
scientists and managers who participated in the fourth and final workshop in the series (26 August 1992). The term
consensus is used to represent group solidarity on an issue; a judgement arrived at by most of the scientists and managers
present. In all cases, the consensus was unanimous or nearly unanimous. The conclusions and recommendations are
arranged in a sequence that ``tracks'' the evolution of thinking of the participants. The conclusions and recommendations
reached by the group reflect the participants' best scientific and technical judgements, not necessarily the positions
of their affiliated agencies or organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following conclusions and recommendations are intended to provide guidance and information on how estuarine
standards could be developed and how different levels of protection of estuarine resources could be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The full justifications to these conclusions and recommendations are contained in technical papers that accompany
this report and in other documents prepared for the San Francisco Estuary Project. (Appendix E).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the complex nature of the freshwater delivery and distribution system in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta estuary, there is at present no single, simple, accurate measure of freshwater input to the estuary
that conveys information important to resource managers and to the public, and that is meaningful to those with special
concerns about how fluctuations in freshwater inflow to the estuary affect habitat and the condition of the estuarine
ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estuarine standards should be developed to be used in conjunction with flow standards. One set of standards should
be based upon an index of the physical response of the estuary to fluctuations in the input of fresh water. These standards
should have diagnostic value in providing, throughout the year, a level of protection to the estuary and to important
ecosystem values and functions consistent with environmental goals and objectives for the Bay-Delta estuary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estuarine standards to be used in conjunction with flow standards should be based upon an index that is simple and inexpensive
to measure accurately, that has ecological significance, that integrates a number of important estuarine properties
and processes, and that is meaningful to a large number of constituencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity should be used as an index for the development of some estuarine standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Justification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the first workshop (August 1991), participants identified and assessed a number of indices of the estuary's responses
to flow to use in managing freshwater discharge to the estuary. The preliminary, preworkshop, choice was the position
of the entrapment zone. This index was abandoned quickly, however. The entrapment zone is important to estuarine
ecosystem processes and functions, but at present there is no single, straightforward ``entrapment zone index''
suitable for monitoring the position or strength of the entrapment zone as a function of freshwater input.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity was selected as the most appropriate index because: (1) The salinity distribution is of direct ecological
importance to many species; (2) the salinity distribution is a result of the interplay of freshwater input, geometry
of the estuarine basin, diversion of fresh water in the Delta, and the tidal regime; and (3) salinity measurements
can be made accurately, directly, easily, and economically. Moreover, since most of the major concerns about reductions
in the freshwater input to the estuary are associated either directly or indirectly with the loss or alteration of
low salinity habitat, salinity is an ideal index for keeping track of the extent_both area and volume_of low salinity
habitat. The salinity distribution represents the response of the estuary to different combinations of river discharge,
diversions and withdrawals, tidal regime, and basin geometry.

Because the difference between surface and near-bottom salinities is small and because the relationship between
them is reasonably well known, surface salinity could also be used. Near-bottom salinity is recommended, however,
because it is a more stable indicator.

(5) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estuarine systems are characterized not only by short-term responses to the mean salinity at any given location,
but also by responses to longer-term seasonal, annual and interannual variability in salinity and other properties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent advances in scientific understanding indicate that this dynamic character of healthy estuarine ecosystems
is particularly true for the distribution and abundance of wetland vegetation, but also holds for other aquatic organisms.

The potential importance of variations in salinity on different time scales to the structure and dynamics of estuarine
ecosystems should be considered in developing salinity standards. Deviations from the patterns of salinity variability
in the historical data set could increase the risk of not achieving environmental goals and objectives even if mean

Justification

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is strong biological evidence from a number of estuaries throughout the world that variability in flow, in circulation
and mixing, in the salinity distribution, and in the distribution of other important properties and processes is
important in maintaining a healthy estuarine ecosystem. Therefore, variability in flow above the threshold needed
to meet the seasonal salinity standard is encouraged.

(6) Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Empirical statistical relationships were developed between a variety of estuarine properties and resources, and
the position of the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

U
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 isohaline and other flow-related variables. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The relationships developed are statistical relationships. They are not proof of cause-effect.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The relationships indicate clearly, however, that the position of the near-bottom 2

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 isohaline can serve as a powerful diagnostic indicator of the condition of biological ``units'' (communities, populations)
across a range of different trophic levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the information these relationships can provide, water managers will be in a far better position to regulate
freshwater discharge to the estuarine system to produce, on the average,

 predictable and desirable ecological responses of the estuary consistent with goals selected for the estuarine
ecosystem. If this strategy is followed, the probability of the desired ecological response will be enhanced and
the chances of undesirable ecological surprises in the estuary will be reduced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The salinity distribution should be monitored continuously at a series of at least six stations spaced approximately
five kilometers apart and located along the channel between about Emmaton and Carquinez Bridge. Measurements should
be made at least near the surface and near the bottom at each station. The data should be telemetered to a convenient
location for timely analysis and interpretation. These continuous monitoring data should be supplemented with
detailed surveys to map the distribution of salinity in three dimensions. The data should be readily available in
a timely way to all interested parties.

During the second and third workshops, and during intersessions between workshops, a systematic search was made
to select the most powerful tools of analysis to describe how diagnostic biological indicators respond to changes
in position of the near-bottom 2

at least a rudimentary understanding exists for the causal mechanisms underlying many of these relationships. The

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isohaline is important either because it is a direct causal factor or because it is highly correlated with a direct
causal factor (e.g., diversions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and diversion by the various water projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity standards should be keyed to the existing city, county, regional, state, and federal water diversion and
distribution system. Proposed changes to that system should trigger a re-evaluation of the salinity standards to
ensure that they will continue to provide the desired level of environmental protection while retaining as much flexibility
as possible in meeting the state's other needs for water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a broad class of models can be constructed, including mechanistic and statistical models that incorporate
both biological and physical parameters and other factors such as diversions, exports, and antecedent conditions,
efforts should be enhanced to ensure a consistent, long-term accurate measurement program to enhance these models
and to decrease the uncertainties in their application. The ultimate goal is to have a predictive model that incorporates
the position of the 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

(9) Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity standards should be based upon the best scientific and technical knowledge. A method is needed to summarize
and to advance the state of scientific and technical knowledge of the complex relationships between variations in
the position of the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

responses.

Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Salinity and flow-response matrices should be developed for different biologically important periods of the year.
The matrices should summarize the existing state of knowledge of the responses of a rich variety of estuarine organisms
and communities as well as estuarine properties and processes, to the location of the near-bottom 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
U
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 isohaline and associated freshwater discharge to the estuary. The estuarine properties and biological responses
initially identified for inclusion in these matrices are summarized in Exhibit A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Matrix Manager should be appointed to oversee the development of the summary matrices and to ensure quality control.
The Matrix Manager should orchestrate the analyses of relevant data and ensure that the results of the analyses are
cast into forms appropriate for the intended uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because estuarine habitat suitability and, therefore, estuarine ecosystem health are not simply a function of the
instantaneous salinity distribution, the entry in each response cell of the matrix, whenever possible, should be
based upon the development of functional relationships of estuarine properties to isohaline positions (and freshwater
input to the estuary) that incorporate lagged terms, seasonal variability, and other water management variables.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ideally, the input to each matrix cell would include a directory of the appropriate model, or models, that could be
used for prediction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed matrices are shorthand methods for keeping track of advances in the state of scientific knowledge and
for ensuring that the most up-to-date scientific knowledge is used in decision-making. They are not intended to be
used as isolated regulatory tools. They are a summary of the state of development of those tools, a guide to which tools
to use during different times of the year, and an index of where to find them. The responsibility for development of
the matrices and for periodically updating them should be institutionalized. One appropriate agency might be the
Interagency Ecological Studies Program.

The proposed matrices are an effective shorthand way of summarizing in a convenient format the status of a large amount
of data and information relating the responses of the estuary to fluctuations in freshwater inflow and to other water
management variables. The matrices are a useful vehicle for summarizing the biological benefits_using a broad array
of response indicators_of positioning the near-bottom 2

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 salinity isohaline at various distances upstream (inland) from the Golden Gate Bridge during different periods
of the year. The proposed matrices would provide the first quantitative and comprehensive summary of how the San Francisco
Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta estuary ecosystem responds to fluctuations in freshwater inflow to the estuary
(Delta outflow) and to the estuary's changing salinity regime. The matrices have further advantages. They will provide
managers, policy-makers and the public with: (1) a clear statement by the scientific community of the current status
of understanding of the effects of different freshwater discharge-diversion scenarios on the estuarine ecosystem;
(2) an identification of critical gaps in scientific knowledge that can be used to guide future research and monitoring
activities; and (3) a summary that is easily updated on a cell-by-cell basis as new knowledge is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The models upon which the matrices are based can serve as tools for regulatory agencies to use in incorporating the
environmental needs of the estuary into a set of management prescriptions for storing, releasing, and diverting
water for consumptive uses. Section of the level or degree of biological response to be achieved_the level of environmental
protection_is the responsibility of regulatory bodies acting in response to society's priorities.

Goals should be expressed in terms of desired conditions for some future time. Progress toward those goals should

depleted. Data from the Interagency Ecological Studies Program and the University of California at Davis indicate
clearly that species at every trophic level are now at, or near, record low levels in the Delta and in Suisun Bay. This
is not surprising considering the recent drought, the introduction of exotic species, and the increased diversion
of water.

large-scale reclamation of historical tidal marshlands. The results of these analyses would provide a valuable

1. Calculating Delta Outflow Over Historical Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Net Delta outflow at Chipps Island is estimated by performing a water balance at the boundary of the Delta. The water
balance involves adding the total Delta inflow and Delta precipitation runoff, then subtracting Delta channel depletions
and exports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Equation 1, below. DWR has estimated net Delta outflow for water years 1956&hyph;present with their flow accounting
model, DAYFLOW. A similar model, using a smaller number of measured flows, was used to estimate Delta outflow from
1929&hyph;1962. In the years of overlap the two models yield very similar results.

The four components used to calculate net Delta outflow are based on a variety of measurements. Most of the river inflows
are gaged or directly measured at some point before they enter the Delta. Local precipitation is derived by multiplying
the surface area of the Delta by the rainfall recorded at Stockton. Local precipitation is usually a trivial amount
of flow but within-Delta uses (called channel depletions) can be substantial. Prior to construction of Shasta Dam
and its regulation of Sacramento River flow, net Delta outflow was often negative during summer months because channel
depletions exceeded Delta outflow. The level of channel depletions in DAYFLOW are based on average monthly crop demands
for the acreage of each crop grown on Delta islands. Exports are directly measured at the point of diversion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the arithmetic nature of these estimates of Delta outflow, the estimated flows cannot reflect the impacts
of such factors as the spring/neap tidal cycles, wind, etc. that would affect the actual mean daily flow velocities
in the western Delta.

The daily estimates of net Delta outflow from October 1, 1939 to September 30, 1975 were used to calculate the frequency
with which the 2 ppt isohaline was downstream of each of the specified positions in each year. Isohaline position is
a function of net Delta outflow on a particular day and the isohaline position on the previous day, as specified in Eq.
2. (Kimmerer and Monismith 1993).

The proposed criteria were developed to reflect the average position of the 2 ppt isohaline in different water year
types, according to the classification adopted by the State Board (SWRCB 1991). First, for each year from 1940 to 1975,
the number of days on which the 2 ppt level was attained at each target location was tabulated. These totals were then
averaged across each water year type. Because no critical years were available for comparison during this historical
period, the average position of the 2 ppt isohaline in critical years was extrapolated from the other year types. The
extrapolation was performed by fitting a curvilinear model to the averages for the other year types. These extrapolations
are shown in Figures 1 and 2, above. The results of average number of days for each year type, along with the extrapolated
values for critical years, are presented in Table 1, above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No estimate of the location of the 2 ppt isohaline on October 1, 1939 was available, so the starting position in October
1939 was assumed to be 75 km. However, sensitivity analysis showed that the calculated isohaline position on February
1 was largely independent of the assumed isohaline position on the preceding October 1. This sensitivity analysis
was performed as follows: for each of the ten years from 1940 to 1949, the February 1 isohaline position was calculated
under two assumptions: (1) that the October 1 starting position was at the Golden Gate (km 0), and (2) that the October
1 starting position was 100 km upstream of the Golden Gate. The historical delta outflow patterns and volumes differed
greatly among these years and the calculated February 1 isohaline positions ranged from 49 km above the Golden Gate
after wet winters to as much as 72 km above the Golden Gate during dry winters. However, by February 1 the difference
in calculated positions based on the two different starting positions varied by no more than 0.1 km in any year.

Appendix III describes the models used to create and measure the salmon smolt survival indices for the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers. These indices and the underlying models represent the state-of-the-art analyses of the factors
critical to maintaining habitat conditions necessary to protect cold water fish migration. Nevertheless, as further
scientific work is completed and the new data is analyzed in the models, EPA anticipates that the models and indices
will be further refined. EPA intends that these refinements be incorporated into the State's criteria during the
triennial review process.

Derivation of the Sacramento River Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The smolt survival index for fall-run outmigrating smolts in the Sacramento River Delta has been developed by the
US Fish and Wildlife Service, using coded-wire tagged hatchery-raised smolts released at various locations and
under different conditions within the Bay/Delta, and recovered by trawl downstream. The methods are described in
USFWS, 1987. Since estimates of total tagged fish in the river cross-section (based on trawl mouth size and time fished)
yielded a maximum survival index of nearly 1.8, and the frequency distribution plot of survival indices indicated
an approximately normal distribution with a median near 1.0, the indices were divided by 1.8 to provide biologically
meaningful survival rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to estimate the benefits of various measures to achieve these indices, a multiple regression smolt survival
model was developed for the Sacramento River portion of the Delta. The model, based on tagged smolt releases between
1978 and 1989, is described in Kjelson et al, 1989; a more recent verification and analysis is described in USFWS, 1992a
and 1992b. The Sacramento River portion of the Delta was divided into three reaches for survival analysis: (1) The
Sacramento River from Sacramento to Walnut Grove, where the Cross-Delta Channel and Georgiana Slough divert water
from the main-stem Sacramento River into the central Delta; (2) Walnut Grove to Chipps Island (at the confluence of
the Delta river systems) via the central Delta; and (3) Walnut Grove to Chipps Island via the Sacramento River system.
Survival indices were converted to mortalities by subtracting from 1.0, and were correlated with ecologically meaningful
factors for each reach. Multiple regression analysis was then used to develop equations for each reach which included
the significant (p&lt;.05) factors affecting mortality. The equations used to calculate mortality for each reach
(as identified above) are:

The USFWS is also estimating survival from recovery of tagged fish in the ocean salmon fishery. The results correlate
with the (unadjusted) trawl recovery survival indices (p&lt;0.01; r=0.89; USFWS 1992b), and further increase confidence
in the survival indices as a good measure of migration success and habitat conditions.

Sacramento River Delta survival index values reflecting historical habitat conditions in different types of water
years (Table 2) were calculated by the USFWS using the 1989 version of the above models, together with historical data
on temperatures, water exports, and the percentage of Sacramento River flows diverted at Walnut Grove, as described
in USFWS 1992a. All total survival values are calculated as monthly averages, and assume, based on past sampling results,
that 17% migrate through the Delta from the Sacramento River in April, 65% in May, and 18% in June. At low temperatures,
the Sacramento River regression gives mortality values (m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of less than zero, indicating that the regression does not give biologically meaningful results at these lower temperatures.
The USFWS transforms these negative values to zeros before calculating total survival.

Derivation of San Joaquin River Index

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The smolt survival indices for the San Joaquin River Delta were developed from coded-wire tagged smolt study results
(USFWS 1992b). The CWT experiments were specifically designed to evaluate the benefit of constructing a barrier
at the head of the Old River Channel to keep smolts in the main channel of the San Joaquin River. Smolts diverted into
the Old River Channel are on a direct path to the State and Federal pumping plants, and are also likely subject to high
temperatures and increased predation. The smolt survival relationship for smolts kept in the San Joaquin River is:

There was evidence from the individual CWT studies that water exports had a substantial effect on survival for those
smolts migrating down the San Joaquin to Suisun Bay. For instance, separate releases in 1989 under high export conditions
and low export conditions indicate approximately double the survival under low export conditions. Although adding
exports to the regression equation did not improve it, probably because there are not enough experimental releases
under enough variety of conditions to provide a significant relationship, the USFWS developed an additional equation
to model this factor, and used both this equation and the above flow equation to estimate smolt survival indices for
the San Joaquin River. A discussion of the methodology is provided in USFWS 1992a and 1992b. This additional relationship

Past adult escapement data was used to estimate smolt survival for historical conditions because there is still not
enough CWT information under a broad enough variety of flow and export conditions to rely solely on CWT study results.
Escapement values on the Y axis were replaced with survival values from 0 to 1.0. This assumes that adult production
is an indicator of smolt survival. This assumption is generally valid, because less of the overall natural mortality
occurs after the smolts enter the ocean. The relationship is as follows:

The USFWS used this relationship to estimate historical smolt survival indices for various periods of time (see Table

relationship between flow at Stockton and survival through the lower San Joaquin River (USFWS 1992a).

The Four River Unimpaired Flow for a current water year (October 1 to September 30) is a forecast of the sum of the following
locations: Sacramento River above Bend Bridge, near Red Bluff; total inflow to Oroville Reservoir; Yuba River at
Smartville; American River, total inflow to Folsom Reservoir. The flow determinations are made and are published
by the California Department of Water Resources in Bulletin 120 which is available from the California Department
of Water Resources, 3251 S Street, Sacramento, CA 95816. Preliminary determinations of year classification shall
be made in February, March, and April with final determination in May. These preliminary determinations shall be
based on hydrological conditions to date plus forecasts of future runoff assuming normal precipitation for the remainder
of the water year.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) revises its proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypomesus transpacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) originally published on October 3, 1991, concurrently with the proposal to list the species, pursuant to the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was published
on March 5, 1993. In the final rule, the Service postponed the decision on critical habitat determination for up to
1 year beyond the date that the final rule was due (October 3, 1993) in accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the
Act. The Service has refined the primary constituent elements described in the original critical habitat proposal.
This revised proposed rule supersedes all aspects of the Service's previous proposal. Critical habitat designation
for the delta smelt would provide additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require
Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts
prior to making a final decision on the size and configuration of critical habitat. The Service solicits data and comments
from the public on all aspects of this revised proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the January 6, 1989 (50 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate
species. Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession are sufficient to support proposals
for listing. On June 29, 1990, the Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, President-Elect
of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species
with critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that substantial information had been presented indicating
that the petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta
smelt as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition
finding in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire
water column bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length
of Montezuma Slough, portions of the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, portions of
the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically
less than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication
of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service published a notice of public hearing on the proposed rule on December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877). Public hearings
were conducted in California on January 9, 1992, in Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January
16, 1992, in Visalia. At each meeting, testimony was taken from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final
rule, the Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation for up to 1 year beyond the date that the final
rule was due (October 3, 1993) in accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act. The economic analysis necessary
to determine critical habitat was still in progress at that time. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published
a notice that the public comment period on the proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was reopened
until April 30, 1993, to allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not been submitted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is required to base critical habitat designations on the best scientific and commercial data available
(50 CFR 424.12). Subsequent to publication of the October 3, 1991, proposed rule, the Service received new information
on the current distribution of the delta smelt, primarily from other State and Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based primarily on information gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam, California
Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, University of California,
pers. comm., 1993), the Service proposes to expand the geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional
areas now known to constitute important spawning habitat. In 1993, delta smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at
least as far upstream as Sacramento and Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs
(Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively
large numbers of delta smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993).
For these reasons, the proposed critical habitat has been revised to encompass these upstream habitats. Protection
of these upstream spawning habitats is essential to ensure recovery of the species. Hence, this rule proposes critical
habitat for the following geographic area: Areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and
the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays);
the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma Sloughs; and the existing contiguous
waters contained within the Delta. As used in this rule, the term ``Delta'' refers to all tidal waters contained within
the legal definition of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, as delineated by section 12220 of the State of California's
Water Code of 1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an April 23, 1993, letter, received during the public comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
requested that new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta water quality standards be
considered in the Service's designation of critical habitat. The Service has used this information to refine the
primary constituent elements described in the original critical habitat proposal. (The term ``primary constituent
element'' is defined in the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of this rule.) The Service's original proposal
listed the following constituent elements: Space for population growth, cover or shelter, maintenance of appropriate
littoral zone reproduction habitat to sustain embryos and to rear larvae and juveniles, and 0&hyph;2 parts per thousand
(ppt) salinities during the January to June delta smelt reproductive season. As part of the background for formulation
of its proposed water quality standards, EPA analyzed the number of days that low salinity (2 ppt) water historically
was located at three positions in Suisun Bay. The revised primary constituent elements incorporate this new information.
As described in the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of this rule, the Service has revised the primary constituent
elements to include those features that provide temporal and spatial variability of low salinity waters that will
deter further invasion of exotic species, produce high zooplankton densities for food, and simulate natural processes
and historical conditions. The primary constituent elements also describe in detail the months that each delta smelt
life stage requires protective habitat conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the information presented by EPA, the Service has determined that, if implemented, EPA's proposed
water quality standards would likely significantly affect critical habitat as proposed in the October 3, 1991, rule.
Consequently, the Service is proposing this revised rule to reduce the potential for inconsistencies between EPA's
standards and the Service's proposed critical habitat. Resolving the inconsistencies will afford the smelt the
same or better protection as would have been achieved through the earlier proposal.

Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act as written do not specify how government actions should be coordinated
or agency conflicts should be resolved. However, because the Service and EPA recognize that their proposed regulatory
actions overlap both biologically and economically, both agencies are working closely to provide a comprehensive,
ecosystem-based approach to the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta Estuary. This coordination should also provide a set of regulatory actions that are integrated in both
substance and timing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or adversely modify listed species' critical habitat. EPA's proposed
action to designate water quality standards must comply with the section 7 requirement. EPA has initiated a formal
consultation process under section 7. Additionally, the Clean Water Act requires protection of the most sensitive
use within each category of designated uses. Protection of endangered and threatened species is considered a designated
use within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing under the Endangered Species Act provides
one method to identify the most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and the salinity criteria that constitute EPA's
proposed water quality standards are directly related. Specifically, the occurrence of salinities of 2 parts per
thousand (ppt) in Suisun Bay was identified as a critical habitat primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991,
critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate that salinities associated with the distribution
of delta smelt may provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are affected by freshwater discharge
from the Bay/Delta Estuary. Favorable conditions from February through June are extremely important to the abundance
and reproductive success of almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Bay/Delta Estuary. EPA's
proposed water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June and, therefore, address
both critical habitat requirements for delta smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species
that rely on estuarine habitat.

Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the city of Sacramento on the
Sacramento River and Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle

 1992). Recently, however, Wang (1991) recorded larval delta smelt from the Sacramento River as far north as its confluence
with the Feather River. The delta smelt is an euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in
fresh water and has been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (ppt) salinity (Moyle

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the entrapment
zone (mixing zone at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966,

The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where
salinity varies spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. (The term
estuary refers to a partially enclosed water body of variable salinity with freshwater and seawater inflow.) Despite
this tremendously variable environment, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable
habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the entrapment zone (Peter Moyle,
University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Since the 1850s, however, the amount and extent of suitable habitat
for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin
Rivers led to increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the Estuary (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked
the beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment,
upstream or reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and constriction of habitat in the less productive,
deep-water river channels of the Delta (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). These adverse conditions are primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water diverted from
the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central
Valley Project began in water year 1940. The State Water Project began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion
of fresh water being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels (Moyle et al. 1992). The high
proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh environmental conditions experienced by the
delta smelt during the recent 6-year drought. The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), final rule listing the delta smelt as
a threatened species describes in detail the factors that have led to this species' decline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt focuses on habitat conditions required
during specific life stages (spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult migration) of this annual
species to ensure its eventual recovery. Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly
productive brackish-water habitat associated with the entrapment zone to disperse widely into river channels and
tidally-influenced backwater sloughs (Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). Migrating adults with nearly mature
eggs have been taken at the Central Valley Project's Tracy Pumping Plant from late December 1990 to April 1991 (Wang
1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the entrapment zone (Wang 1991). Most spawning
occurs in tidally-influenced backwater sloughs and channel edgewaters (Moyle 1976; Wang 1986, 1991; Moyle et al.
1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992), the adhesive, demersal eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and
submerged branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in
Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers.
comm., 1993). Delta smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun Sloughs and their tributaries (Dale
Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993; Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July). Moyle
(1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February and
March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early
July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data for a closely related species, delta smelt eggs probably hatch in 12 to 14 days (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). After hatching, larvae are transported downstream toward the entrapment zone where they are retained by the
vertical circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). The pelagic larvae and juveniles feed on zooplankton. When the entrapment zone is located in a broad geographic
area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of
phytoplankton and zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval and juvenile fish, including
delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In general, estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman
and Horne 1983). Estuarine environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food and shallow, protective
habitat for young.

When the entrapment zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large
expanse of shallow-water and marsh habitat. Dispersion in areas downstream from the State and Federal water pumps
and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive,
protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In contrast, when located upstream, the entrapment
zone becomes confined in the deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain fewer shoal areas,
have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack high zooplankton productivity.

 (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers,
in July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of Fish and Game, California Department of Water
Resources, and Bureau of Reclamation, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island in Suisun Bay
north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang
1991). These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution
surveys, Wang (1991) was able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to Suisun Bay in late June
and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991).

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied
by the species *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation
of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas
outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination
*&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,''
as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use and the use of all methods and procedures which
are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant
to this Act are no longer necessary.'' Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical
or biological features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the
Act. Hence, critical habitat designation affords species additional protection above and beyond those of listing
in that it preserves options for the species' eventual recovery. Section 3 further states that in most cases the entire
range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat designations alert Federal and State agencies, other organizations, and the public about the importance
of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical habitat also identifies areas that may require special
management or protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions
carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions
that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical
habitat. Section 7 also requires Federal agencies to confer on Federal actions that are likely to result in adverse
modification or destruction of proposed critical habitat. Aside from the added protection provided under section
7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands designated as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to considering biological information in designating critical habitat, the Service also considers
economic and other relevant impacts of designating critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical
habitat when the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat,
provided that the exclusion will not result in the extinction of a species.

In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological
features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12). The Service is required to list the known primary
constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical and biological
features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;

and ecological distributions of a species.

Following are the primary constituent elements necessary to conserve the delta smelt. These elements were determined
in coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality standards. EPA's proposed rule to promulgate
Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta
of the State of California is published in this same

 separate part. In its proposed rule, EPA has requested specific comments on several issues, including the possibility
of modifying the Sacramento River Index for the purposes of developing the salinity criteria, alternative approaches
to the averaging period used in its proposed salinity criteria, and evaluation of the merits of the use of difference
forms of confidence intervals with the proposed criteria. The Fish and Wildlife Service will consider these comments
also in developing its final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements are organized by habitat conditions required for each life stage. The specific
geographic areas and seasons identified for each habitat condition specified below represent the maximum possible
range of each of these variables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the habitat conditions specified below requires as its basis placement of the 2 ppt isohaline at or downstream
of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence from February through June. (An isohaline is a line that can be drawn
to connect all points of equal salinity.) Furthermore, the location of the 2 ppt isohaline must vary according to water
years because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporal and spatial variability of the 2 ppt isohaline will be the most effective deterrent to further invasion
of new introduced species and continued competition by those that are already established,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Placement of the 2 ppt isohaline in an area will also produce the high phytoplankton and zooplankton densities
that characterize most healthy estuarine ecosystems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Variability is needed to simulate natural processes and historical conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 lists the number of days (based on a 14-day running average) that the 2 ppt isohaline must be located at Roe Island,
Chipps Island, or the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence during wet, above normal, below normal, dry, and critically
dry years to achieve the life-stage habitat conditions described below. These required salinity criteria are based
on historical records of the water years between October 1939 (subsequent to the operation of the Federal and State
water projects) and September 1975 (prior to the decline of the delta smelt) (Harry Seraydarian, EPA,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993; Bruce Herbold, EPA, pers. comm., 1993). However, because no critically dry years occurred during this period,
the salinity criteria (required number of days) for these years are based on an extrapolation of the data.

The Roe Island salinity criteria are meant to replicate natural spring storm cycles and are invoked only after uncontrolled
runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. Therefore, the criteria for Roe Island represent the maximum
number of days that the 2 ppt isohaline must be located there.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spawning Habitat_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delta smelt adults seek shallow, tidally-influenced, freshwater (i.e., less than 2 ppt salinity) backwater sloughs
and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable
water quality (i.e., low concentrations of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree
roots and branches and emergent vegetation). Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning
habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs and the Sacramento
River in the Delta, and tributaries of northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start
as early as December and extend until July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Larval and Juvenile Transport_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing
or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical
disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow
disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate
river flow is necessary to transport larvae to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat
is available in Suisun Bay, the salinity criteria described above in Table 1 are required. Reverse flows that maintain
larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and expose them to entrainment interfere with these
transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant
concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval transport is confined to waters contained within
the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat
conditions identified above are important for successful larval transport varies from year to year depending on
when peak spawning occurs. Therefore, habitat conditions suitable for transport of larvae and juveniles may be required
as early as February 1 and as late as August 31.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rearing Habitat_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline (according to the salinity criteria described in Table 1) and suitable water quality
(low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and juveniles a
shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt isohaline
also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal water projects.
However, additional flows above those required to implement the February through June salinity criteria listed
in Table 1 may be required occasionally to protect larval and juvenile delta smelt from being entrained in the State
and Federal water projects during the months of July and August. These additional flows will be required when the previous
year's abundance indices show that the adult population already is at low levels and late spawning conditions have
led to distribution of larval and juvenile delta smelt upstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
Rivers in July and August. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Straits, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay,
Honker Bay, Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile
Slough, and south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical
to the maintenance of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most
upstream extent of tidal excursion when the salinity criteria described in Table 1 are implemented. Protection of
rearing habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February to the end of August.

Adult Migration_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestrained access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from
December to July. Therefore, adequate flow and suitable water quality must be maintained to attract migrating adults
in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma
Sloughs and their tributaries. These areas also must be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption
during migratory periods.

To conserve the delta smelt, critical habitat is proposed for an area encompassing the specific habitat conditions
required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is proposed for the following geographic
area: Areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and
contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff,
First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma Sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta.
The proposed critical habitat is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, and Yolo Counties,
California. The ``Proposed Regulations Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds description
of the revised proposed critical habitat.

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that the activities they authorize, fund, or carry
out are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility is in addition to
the requirement in the same section of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued
existence of any listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both
the survival and recovery of a listed species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined
at 50 CFR 404.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both
the survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly state that such alterations include,
but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the
basis for determining the habitat to be critical. The requirement to consider potential adverse modification of
critical habitat is an incremental consideration above and beyond the review necessary to evaluate the likelihood
of jeopardy and incidental take in section 7 consultations. In section 7 consultations, the Service considers the
potential for adverse modification of the primary constituent elements identified in the critical habitat designation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat a brief
description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may
be affected by such designation. The Service has identified the following list of activities that, depending on the
season of construction and scale of the project, may result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement
of dredged materials on levees of banks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Bridge and marina construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction and implementation of each of these actions requires authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant
to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Based on the Service's review
of all existing or proposed projects that may affect the delta smelt, the great majority that would likely result in
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat also would be likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the species. The Service has not identified any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt without
adversely affecting its critical habitat.

Considerations of Economic and Other Factors

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any
particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical
habitat should it be determined that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such an area
as part of the critical habitat unless it is determined, based on the best scientific and commercial data available,
that the failure to designate such an area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts of designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to listing
of the species. Impacts attributable to listing include those resulting from the taking prohibitions under section
9 of the Act and associated regulations. ``Take,'' as defined in section 3(18) of the Act, includes harm to a listed
species. ``Harm'' means an act that actually kills or injures wildlife. Such an act may include significant habitat
modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral
patterns, including feeding, breeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Impacts attributable to listing also include those resulting from the responsibility of Federal agencies under
section 7 to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened
species. An action could be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species through the destruction
or modification of its habitat regardless of whether that habitat has been formally designated as critical. The Act
provides significant protection to species, including protection to their habitats, as a result of listing. Therefore,
the direct economic and other impacts resulting from additional habitat protection through critical habitat designation
may be incrementally small. In general, the designation of critical habitat supplements the substantive protection
resulting from listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has prepared a draft Regulatory Impact Analysis on its proposed water quality standards. EPA's draft Regulatory
Impact Analysis includes an economic analysis of the effects of the designation of critical habitat for the delta
smelt. This economic analysis concludes that economic costs attributable to the designation of critical habitat
for the delta smelt are relatively small and due primarily to the effects designation of critical habitat would have
upon the five types of actions listed above under the section entitled ``Effects of Critical Habitat Designation.''
An underlying assumption of the draft economic analysis is that the costs associated with implementing EPA's proposed
water quality standards for the Bay/Delta are due primarily to listing the delta smelt as threatened. As the Service
refines its economic analysis, it may determine that this assumption is to some degree inappropriate and that some
of the costs associated with implementing the water quality standards may be attributable to the designation of critical
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with sand and gravel operations (approximately two aggregate operators are located in the Delta),
diking or dredging for agricultural activities, and marina or bridge construction are expected to be similar. Project
proponents or operators would incur costs associated with wetlands restoration, using a replacement ratio of 3 acres
restored for 1 acre destroyed. The cost to restore 1 acre of wetlands ranges between $10,000 and $50,000. However,
for some tracts of land, the costs associated with restoring wetlands may exceed the value derived from the agricultural
activity, in which case the cost attributable to critical habitat would be the loss in agricultural income. The costs
attributable to a designation of critical habitat are not expected to substantially affect levee maintenance operations
because Federal regulatory agencies currently have restrictions that generally avoid adverse effects to the delta
smelt. However, the designation of critical habitat may result in leaving the Montezuma Slough Control Structure's
gates open from December to August rather than November to March. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will prepare a final economic analysis prior to making its final determination on critical habitat. If
that analysis substantially differs from the draft summarized here, the Service will make a revised economic analysis
available to the public for comment prior to a final determination on critical habitat.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by
the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking
and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal
agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species
or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy (see ``Effects of Critical
Habitat Designation'' section), are directly related. Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery
and extinction of the species. The closer a species is to recovery, the greater the certainty of the species' continued
survival. Thus, the terms survival and recovery are related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist
over a given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that influence a species' viability include population
numbers, distribution throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive success. A species
may be considered recovered when there is a high degree of certainty for the species' continued viability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species'
conservation, which, by definition, means recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat apply to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species,
thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation
to the goals and recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery,
the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat should protect the critical habitat's
ability to contribute fully to a species' recovery. Thus, the adverse modification standard may be reached closer
to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas the jeopardy standard traditionally has been applied nearer
to the extinction end of the continuum.

Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized,
carried out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, National Marine Fisheries Service,
and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion facilities,
levee construction or repair, bank protection activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil
disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction, diking of wetlands for conversion
to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of Water
Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards
and promulgates replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if the State standards are found to be inadequate.
In 1991, EPA disapproved portions of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality Control
Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared
proposed replacement standards for those portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures
to protect the federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which the National Marine Fisheries Service has jurisdiction
under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may require consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a requirement for the development of a recovery plan.
The Service convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native fishes
in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for Federal, State, and private
entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery
priorities and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery goals. Site-specific management
actions necessary to achieve survival and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary ecosystem
also will be described in this plan.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 4-month comment period following publication of the October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), proposed rule to list
the delta smelt as threatened and designate its critical habitat, the Service received 360 comments (i.e., letters
and oral testimony) from 348 individuals. The Service received several letters supporting designation of delta
smelt critical habitat as proposed. Many local government agencies, water districts, business and trade associations,
and other private interests submitted comments regarding the presumed economic effects of the proposed critical
habitat designation on industries, planned activities, and development in specific municipalities or geographic
regions of California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that the public comment period on the proposed designation
of critical habitat for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to allow the Service to consider any information
that previously had not been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters: two in support of critical
habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition, and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the
biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt has been revised to reflect the best scientific
information currently available and to ensure that the Service coordinates its final actions with other interested
Federal agencies. For this reason, the Service will address all comments previously received on the economic impacts,
legal requirements, and interpretation of various provisions of the Act during preparation of a final rule. Additionally,
comments received during the 60-day comment period following publication of this revised proposed rule will be used
in preparing a final rule. Only comments addressing the issue of available scientific information used to revise
this proposed rule are responded to in this document. In its final determination on the designation of critical habitat,
the Service will provide a thorough discussion of all comments received in response to the original proposed rule
and to this revised proposed rule.

Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has substantially revised the primary constituent elements in this proposed rule to reflect more closely
the historical placement of low salinity estuarine habitat in Suisun Bay. As part of the background for formulation
of its proposed water quality standards, EPA analyzed the number of days that low salinity (2 ppt) water historically
was located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, Chipps Island, and Roe Island in Suisun Bay.
The Service has revised the primary constituent elements to include those features that provide temporal and spatial
variability of low salinity waters that will deter further invasion of exotic species, produce high zooplankton
densities for food, and simulate natural processes and historical conditions. The ``Primary Constituent Elements''
section of this revised proposed rule describes in detail the months that each delta smelt life stage requires protective
habitat conditions. This revised proposal refines the primary constituent elements to more accurately replicate
historical conditions that are needed to recover the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the Service does not have enough scientific data to substantiate the conclusions that the
location of low salinity habitat in Suisun Bay is important to the recovery of the delta smelt, that delta smelt are
associated with the saltwater-freshwater mixing zone, or that water exports could adversely affect delta smelt
critical habitat as currently proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service Response: Section 4(b)(B)(2) of the Act requires that critical habitat designations be based on the best
scientific data available. As discussed in the ``Habitat Requirements'' and ``Primary Constituent Elements''
sections of this rule, the best available scientific evidence shows that when the entrapment zone is located in a broad
geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone, high densities of phytoplankton
and zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980) and larval and juvenile fish, including delta smelt,
grow rapidly (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When the entrapment zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta smelt are dispersed
widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water and marsh habitat (Harry Seraydarian, EPA, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Dispersion in areas downstream from the State and Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions
protects young smelt from entrainment (diverted into man-made structures or impinged on screens) and distributes
them among the extensive, protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In contrast, high exports
cause the entrapment zone to be pulled upstream into the deep river channels (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). The large river channels are smaller in total surface area, contain fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent
water currents, and lack high zooplankton densities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Service seeks to coordinate its final actions with other interested Federal agencies and because the
Service also has received new distributional information since the October 3, 1991, proposal to designate critical
habitat for the delta smelt, the Service hereby revises the proposal to designate critical habitat. This proposed
rule revision is based on materials received during the public comment period and information received during numerous
meetings and discussions with State and Federal agency biologists, ichthyologists, engineers, and hydrologists.
This new proposal supersedes the October 3, 1991, proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments are particularly
sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The reasons why any habitat (either existing or additional areas) should or should not be determined to be critical
habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Current or planned activities and their possible impacts on proposed critical habitat areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any foreseeable economic or other impacts resulting from the proposed designation of critical habitat; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Economic values associated with benefits of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The methodology the Service might use, under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, in determining whether the benefits of
excluding an area from critical habitat outweigh the benefits of specifying the area as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the primary constituent elements used in determining which areas to propose as critical habitat for the delta
smelt were determined in coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality standards, the Service
also encourages the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any
other interested party to provide comments or suggestions to EPA on its proposed rule to promulgate Water Quality
Standards for Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta of the State
of California. The Fish and Wildlife Service will consider these comments also in developing its final rule. EPA's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within critical
habitat areas, significant economic impacts will not result from the critical habitat designation. Also, no direct
costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities
by this designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened status for the Sacramento splittail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
macrolepidotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended (Act). Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This species is primarily threatened by large freshwater exports from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shallow-water habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial chemicals. This proposal, if made final, would implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act for Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail. The Service seeks all available data and comments from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public regarding this proposal.

As used in this rule, the term ``Delta'' refers to all tidal waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained within the legal definition of the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, as delineated
by section 12220 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State of California's Water Code of 1969. Generally, the Delta is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained within a triangular area that extends south from the city of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento to the confluence of the Stanislaus and San Joaquin Rivers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the southeast corner and Chipps Island in Suisun Bay at the southwest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corner. The term ``Estuary,'' as used in this rule, refers to tidal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters contained in the Sacramento River and San Joaquin Rivers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta, and the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Sacramento splittail were first described in 1854 by W.O. Ayres as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Leuciscus macrolepidotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and by S.F. Baird and C. Girard as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaeqilobus.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although Ayres' species description is accepted, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species was assigned to the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in recognition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinctive characteristics exhibited by the two splittail species 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 (Hopkirk 1973). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. ciscoides,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 endemic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Clear Lake, Lake County, California, has been extinct since the early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970s. The Sacramento splittail (hereafter splittail) represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only extant species in its genus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The splittail is a large cyprinid that can exceed 40 centimeters (16 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inches) in length (Moyle 1976). Adults are characterized by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elongated body, distinct nuchal hump, and small, blunt head, usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with barbels at the corners of the slightly subterminal mouth. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enlarged dorsal lobe of the caudal fin distinguishes the splittail from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other minnows in the Central Valley of California. Splittail are dull, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silvery-gold on the sides and olive-gray dorsally. During spawning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season, the pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins are tinged with an orange-red color. Males develop small white nuptial
tubercles on the head. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Splittail are endemic to California's Central Valley, where they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were once widely distributed (Moyle 1976). Historically, splittail were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found as far north as Redding on the Sacramento River, as far south as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present-day site of Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River, and as far 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream as the current Oroville Dam site on the Feather River and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Folsom Dam site on the American River (Rutter 1908). Recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anglers in Sacramento reported catches of 50 or more splittail per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to damming of these rivers (Caywood 1974). The species was used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the Central Valley Native American diet (Caywood 1974).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent times, dams and diversions have increasingly prevented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream access to large rivers, and the species is now restricted to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small portion of its former range (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter the lower reaches of the Feather (Jones and Stokes 1993) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Rivers (Charles Hanson, State Water Contractors Association, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993) on occasion; however, the species now largely is confined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Delta, Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, and Napa Marsh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Splittail are relatively long-lived, frequently reaching 5 to 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years of age. Females are highly fecund and produce over 100,000 eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year. Populations fluctuate annually depending on spawning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success, which is highly correlated with freshwater outflow and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of shallow-water habitat with submerged vegetation (Daniels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Moyle 1983). Fish usually reach sexual maturity by the end of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second year. Some variability in the period of reproduction exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because older individuals reproduce first, followed by younger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals (Caywood 1974). The onset of spawning is associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rising temperature, and peak spawning occurs from the months of March 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through May, although records of spawning exist for late January to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early July (Wang 1986). Spawning occurs over flooded vegetation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tidal freshwater and euryhaline habitats of estuarine marshes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sloughs and slow-moving reaches of large rivers. Larvae remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shallow, weedy areas close to spawning sites and move into deeper water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as they mature (Wang 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Splittail are benthic foragers that feed on opossum shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neomysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercedis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), although detrital material makes up a large percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their stomach content (Daniels and Moyle 1983). Earthworms, clams, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insect larvae, and other invertebrates also are found in the diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Predators include striped bass and other piscivores. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although primarily a freshwater species, the splittail can tolerate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinities as high as 10 to 18 parts per thousand (ppt) (Moyle 1976, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). In recent years, this fish has been found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most often in slow-moving sections of rivers and sloughs and dead-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sloughs (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1982, Daniels and Moyle 1983). Reports from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1950s, however, mention Sacramento River spawning migrations and catches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of splittail during fast tides in Suisun Bay (Caywood 1974). Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they require flooded vegetation for spawning and rearing, splittail are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently found in areas subject to flooding, such as the major flood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basins distributed throughout the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) survey data from the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 years indicate that the highest catches occurred in shallow areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun and Grizzly Bays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The decline in splittail abundance has taken place during increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human-induced changes to seasonal estuary hydrology and freshwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exports and the accompanying changes in the temporal, spatial, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative ratios of water diversions. These deleterious hydrological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, coupled with severe drought years, introduced aquatic species, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and loss of shallow-water habitat to reclamation, seem to have reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species' capacity to recover from natural seasonal fluctuations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrology for which it was adapted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Analyses of survey data collected since 1967 (Meng 1993) by Service, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDFG, and University of California, Davis, biologists from several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different studies indicate the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) On average, splittail have declined in abundance by 62 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since 1984. Percent decline varied among studies, dependent upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of sampling effort. The greatest declines (over 80 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were found from studies that sampled the shallow Suisun Bay area, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
center of the species' range. A study that began in 1980 at the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary, the outermost edge of splittail range, found the lowest percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline (34 percent). The number of splittail young taken at State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal pumping facilities (per acre-foot of water pumped) has declined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64 percent since 1984; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Successful reproduction in splittail is highly correlated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet years, but within these wet years, young-of-the-year taken per unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort has declined steadily from a high of 12.3 in 1978 to 0.3 in 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) A strong relationship exists between young-of-the-year abundance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and outflow (i.e., river outflow into San Francisco Bay after water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exports are removed). As outflow increases, annual abundance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail young increases. Changes in outflow explain 73 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes seen in splittail young abundance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) When young-of-the-year abundance is predicted using unimpaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outflow (i.e., river outflow without water exports removed), abundance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is higher than expected in dry years, indicating that water exports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect young-of-the-year abundance in dry years. In dry years when river 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outflow is reduced, high proportions of outflow are diverted, resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lower than expected splittail young numbers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (5) Lower than expected numbers of splittail young persisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the recent 6-year drought in California. This prolonged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of poor reproductive success may affect the stock's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) Splittail are most abundant in shallow areas of Suisun and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grizzly Bays and are vulnerable to increased salinities. Salinities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase when, as a result of water exports and drought conditions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone (mixing zone at the freshwater-saltwater interface) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved upstream. Concentration of splittail in shallow areas suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they are particularly vulnerable to reclamation activities, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredging and the diking and filling of wetlands; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (7) Splittail distribution has shifted upstream into the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento River and South Delta since 1983. Ninety-one percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail captured in San Pablo and lower Suisun Bays from 1967 to 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were taken before 1983, and 77 percent of the splittail captured in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower Sacramento River and South Delta were taken after 1983. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and Federal water project pumps are located near the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento River and South Delta, this upstream shift in splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution increases splittail mortality at the pumps. In 1993, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of splittail young taken at the Federal pumping facility was four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times higher than in previous years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A variety of factors affects the estuarine ecosystems and has led to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decline of Sacramento splittail. Principal among these factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific to the Estuary are the altered hydraulics and reduced outflow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Delta caused by export of freshwater from the Sacramento and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joaquin Rivers through State and Federal water diversion projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional threats to this species include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Loss at pumping plants and in-Delta diversion sites, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Loss of spawning and nursery habitat as a consequence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draining and diking for agriculture, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The causes of splittail decline in the Estuary are multiple and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synergistically threaten this species. The individual threats include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduced river outflows, primarily in the Sacramento and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Loss of shallow-water habitat; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mortality caused by diversion into State and Federal water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects and privately-operated agricultural in-Delta water diversions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Human and natural perturbations of the food web; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Presence of toxic substances in the aquatic habitat (e.g.,

The Service included the Sacramento splittail as a category 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate species for possible future listing as endangered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened in the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 2 includes species for which information contained in Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
files indicates that proposing to list is possibly appropriate but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional data is needed to support a listing proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1992, the Service received a petition from Mr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gregory A. Thomas of the Natural Heritage Institute to add the splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for this species in the Sacramento and San Joaquin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rivers and those estuaries. In his letter, Mr. Thomas identified the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following eight organizations as co-petitioners: American Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Society, Bay Institute of San Francisco, Natural Heritage Institute, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planning and Conservation League, Save San Francisco Bay Association, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Friends of the River, San Francisco Baykeeper, and the Sierra Club. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 24, 1993, the Service issued a 90-day finding, notice of which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36184), that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petition presented substantial information indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested action may be warranted. The Service initiated a status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and analyzed available data on this species (Meng 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional sources of information describing the human factors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects that may affect this species include expert testimonies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented to the California State Water Resources Control Board's 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Quality/Water Rights Proceeding on the San Francisco Bay and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and 1992 Water Rights Phase of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay-Delta Estuary Proceedings. This proposal constitutes the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding on the petition to list the Sacramento splittail.

) and

regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing

provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sacramento splittail was once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widely distributed in the Central Valley of California from Redding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modern-day site of Friant Dam near the City of Fresno. It is now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted to western, northern, and southern portions of the Delta due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to dams, diversions, dredging, and the diking and filling of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flood basins. Within the species' constricted range, splittail have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined by 62 percent since 1984. However, the overall percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline over its historical range is much greater. Populations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuated somewhat in the past, with most recruitment taking place in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet years. In wet years since 1976, however, splittail recruitment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined consistently with catches per unit effort of 12.3, 8.1, 2.0, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.3, and 0.3 for 1978, 1982, 1983, 1986, and 1993, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Splittail declines are highest (82 percent) in the shallow-water Suisun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay area, which is the center of its distribution. This may reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of productive brackish-water habitat in Suisun and Grizzly Bays due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to increased salinities caused by low outflows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Delta water diversions and exports total to about 9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million acre-feet per year. Federal and State projects presently export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 6 million acre-feet per year when sufficient water is available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in-Delta agricultural uses result in diversion of about 3 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional acre-feet per year. Plans currently being prepared could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially induce increased exports and diversions in the future. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service knows of 22 major Central Valley Project, State Water Project, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or private organization proposals that would result in increased water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exports from the Delta, reduced water inflow to the Delta, changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the timing and volume of Delta inflow, or increases in heavy metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of the Delta. These proposed projects or actions include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but are not limited to Central Valley Project Operations Criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan (including Friant Contract Renewals), Los Banos Grandes Reservoir, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Marsh Project Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three and Four, Kern Water Bank, Arvin Edison water storage and exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, Federal Water Project change in diversion point, and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Project Pump additions. These projects would modify or destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the habitat of this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Federal pumping plant has been operated at capacity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many years except for a few drought years, increased exports at this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant appear unlikely. However, the State Water Project pumping plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the capacity of the State Aqueduct have considerable unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity. The California Department of Water Resources (1992) reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the past and projected State Water Project deliveries from Delta sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the years of 1962 to 2035. In the 1980s, deliveries ranged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5 million acre-feet to 2.8 million acre-feet. By 2010, deliveries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up to 4.2 million acre-feet are planned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1983, the proportion of water exported from the Delta during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October through March has been higher than in earlier years (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). The timing of these proportionally higher exports have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coincided with the spawning season of the splittail. Federal and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water diversion projects in the southern Delta export, by absolute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume, mostly Sacramento River water with some San Joaquin River water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, during periods of high export pumping and low to moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river outflows, reaches of the San Joaquin River reverse direction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow upstream to the pumping plants located in the southern Delta. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-operated pumping plant presently exports water at rates up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6,400 cubic feet per second (cfs). The State is considering proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to export an additional 3,900 cfs. The Federal pumping plant can export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water at rates up to 4,600 cfs. In addition, local private diverters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export up to 5,000 cfs from about 1,800 diversions scattered throughout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When total diversion rates are high relative to Delta outflow, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower San Joaquin River and other channels have a net upstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., reverse or negative) flow, out-migrating larval and juvenile fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of many species become disoriented. Large mortalities occur as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of loss to pumps and predation by striped bass at the various water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and other diversion sites. Because data from State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal pumping facilities indicate that splittail migrate upstream to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawn, positive outflows are also important to transport splittail young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream (Meng 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, the number of days of reversed San Joaquin River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow have increased (Moyle

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992), particularly during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February-June spawning months for splittail. All size classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail young suffer near total loss when they are entrained by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pumping plants and diversions in the south Delta. Few young are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively salvaged at the Federal and State pumping plant screens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This species' embryonic, larval, and postlarval mortality rates also are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher when reduced outflows cause increases in salinity and relocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the entrapment zone (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Splittail are adapted for life in the entrapment zone. Estuaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ecosystems where the entrapment zone and salinity levels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the interaction of river outflow and tidal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Splittail are most abundant in the shallow waters of Suisun Bay, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is historically associated with the entrapment zone. The young of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species require high zooplankton densities produced by the entrapment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone environment. The best survival and growth of splittail occurs when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entrapment zone occupies a large geographic area with extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shoal regions within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fall mid-water trawl survey data collected by CDFG indicate that 76 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the splittail captured from 1967 to 1992 in the Delta were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken in the shallow areas of Suisun and Grizzly Bays (Meng 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During periods of drought and increased water diversions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone and associated fish populations are shifted farther 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream in the Estuary. During years prior to 1984, the entrapment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone was located in Suisun Bay from October through March (except in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months with exceptionally high outflows or during years of extreme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought). From April through September, the entrapment zone usually was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found upstream in the river channels. Since 1984, with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record 1986 flood outflows, the entrapment zone has been located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily in the river channels during the entire year because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought and increased water exports and diversions. When located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream, the entrapment zone is confined to deep river channels where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total surface area is smaller, fewer shoal areas of suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning substrate exist, water currents are swifter and more turbulent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and zooplankton productivity is low. In all respects, the upstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river channels are much less favorable for spawning and rearing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail. Splittail declines since 1984 have been concurrent with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing amount and proportion of freshwater diversions that confine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entrapment zone to the narrow, deep, and less productive channels in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower rivers.

Educational Purposes

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This factor is not known to be applicable. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific collecting is conducted for splittail, but these activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not adversely affect this species. Little or no recreational harvest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of splittail is likely occurring because the population has dramatically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined, and it is not a desirable game species. No recent records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail harvest exist, probably because little or no harvest occurs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the identification of this species is often confused with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nongame species. No other recreational or educational uses of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species exist that may affect its abundance.

C. Disease or Predation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This factor is not known to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. However, if the non-native striped bass populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase, all size classes of splittail could be under greater threat of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predation. An effort by CDFG is under way to compensate for striped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bass population mortalities caused by water export projects. The 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
striped bass stock was low relative to the population in the 1960s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, the striped bass compensation program annually released 1 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 million juvenile, hatchery-reared striped bass in the Estuary in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to rebuild the population. However, for the last 2 years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director of CDFG has foregone release of striped bass because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential harm they would cause to the federally-threatened Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River winter-run chinook salmon and delta smelt.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Suisun Bay is the best known nursery habitat for reproduction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larval survival of splittail, but the habitat has been deleteriously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered by higher salinities in the spring. These higher salinities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by a large number of freshwater diversions that allow seawater to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrude farther upstream. At present, there are relatively few periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when freshwater outflow volumes through the Delta and Suisun Bay of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance are mandated for wildlife or fisheries. State and Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies had planned to increase 1991 and 1992 water supplies for out-of-stream uses at the expense of environmental
protection of estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and wildlife resources in the fifth and potentially sixth years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought (Morat 1991). Because of significantly higher than normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitation and subsequent higher instream flows after March 1991, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency request for relaxation of Delta water quality standards was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawn. Should a California drought return, water quality relaxation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action likely will be requested again to favor out-of-stream water use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the need to protect aquatic habitats for fish and wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present regulatory processes do not ensure that water inflows to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay and the western Estuary will be adequate to maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone near or in Suisun Bay to benefit splittail. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California State Water Resources Control Board (Board) has the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to condition or require changes in the amount of water inflow and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of water exported or diverted from the Delta. In testimony given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the Board's Water Quality/Water Rights Hearings in 1987, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service biologist expressed concern for several Delta species including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail (Lorentzen 1987). The Board did not take regulatory or legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to protect this fish or its habitat during the four following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. On May 1, 1991, the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary (1991 Bay/Delta Plan). On September 3, 1991, under provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproved certain water quality standards for the Board's failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt criteria to protect estuarine habitat. In 1993, EPA began the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of formulating replacement standards for those portions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 Bay/Delta Plan that were disapproved. In January 1992, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governor of California announced a new water policy that included a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive to the Board to establish ``interim measures'' to reverse the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline of fishes in the Bay and Delta. Accordingly, the Board released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an interim water quality plan (Draft Decision 1630) in December 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that immediately was suspended by the Governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed rule to promulgate Water Quality Standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bay and Delta is published in this same

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate part; however, enforcement of these standards may be difficult. The Service is aware that the salinity standards
currently in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Water Right Decision 1485) are inconsistently implemented and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently violated. Institutional guarantees of compliance have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lacking in the past and are needed in the future before existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms can contribute to the protection of this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service currently is analyzing the potential effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail and other fish and wildlife resources in California as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of recent enactment of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;575). Two of the stated purposes of this act are to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Protect, restore, and enhance fish, wildlife, and associated habitats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Central Valley and Trinity River basins of California'' and ``to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to the State of California's interim and long-term efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3406(b)(2) dedicates 800,000 acre-feet of Central Valley Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water annually for various purposes, including the benefit of federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed species. Although the Service is reasonably certain that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail will realize some benefit from implementation of the Central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley Project Improvement Act, the magnitude and timeliness of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protections may be inadequate to prevent further decline of splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protective measures currently being implemented to benefit the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt will beneficially affect the splittail by restricting pumping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under certain conditions. However, the ecological requirements of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species differ, especially with respect to timing of important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental stages and habitat use. Splittail need flooded lowland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat for spawning and are particularly vulnerable to disturbance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction of marshy habitat. Therefore, the protections afforded the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt, listed as threatened in 1993 under the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, will not be sufficient to prevent further decline of the splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, the Service considers the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory mechanisms inadequate to ensure the long-term existence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento splittail.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Splittail are vulnerable to extinction from stochastic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events because of the consistent decline in population indices and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severely constricted ranges and distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poor water quality also may adversely affect splittail, either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through direct exposure to toxins or depletion of zooplankton or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invertebrate food sources. All major rivers that are tributary to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary are exposed to large volumes of agricultural and industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that are applied in the Central Valley watershed (Nichols et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1986). Agricultural chemicals and their residues, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals originating in urban runoff, find their way into the rivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Estuary. Approximately 10 percent of the total pesticide use in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States occurs in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily on orchards, alfalfa, and rice during the months of January to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June of each year (Jewel Bennett, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Recently, high concentrations of organophosphate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbamate pesticides from agricultural uses have been documented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering the Estuary. These pesticides are acutely toxic to zooplankton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fishes as far west as Martinez in Suisun Bay and as far south as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vernalis on the San Joaquin River (Bennett, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of pesticide use coincide with the timing of migration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning, and early development of splittail. During rainfall runoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events, acutely toxic pulses of pesticides move down the rivers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Estuary with remarkable persistence and relatively little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxicology studies of rice field irrigation drain water of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colusa Basin Drainage Canal have documented significant toxicity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drain water to striped bass embryos and larvae, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oryzias latipes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
larvae 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in the Cyprinodontidae family), and the opossum shrimp, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major food organism of striped bass larvae and juveniles (Bailey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1991). This drainage canal flows into the Sacramento River just north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the City of Sacramento. The majority of drain water samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected during April and May 1990 were acutely toxic to striped bass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larvae (96 hour exposures); this was the third consecutive year that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colusa Basin rice irrigation drain water was acutely toxic (Bailey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991). Splittail may be similarly affected by agricultural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial chemical run-off. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some heavy metal contaminants have been released into the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from industrial and mining enterprises. While the effects of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminating compounds on splittail larvae and their zooplankton food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources are not well known, the compounds could adversely affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survival. In addition, increases in urban development in the Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley will continue to result in concurrent increases in urban runoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selenium has been found in aquatic organisms (Saiki and Lowe 1987) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish species in the San Joaquin River watershed (Nakamoto and Hassler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992). Selenium has been shown to cause developmental defects in and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortality of fish species (Hermanutz 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, untreated discharges of ship ballast water has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced exotic aquatic species to the Estuary ecosystem (Carlton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Several exotic species may adversely affect the splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An asian clam (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Potamocorbula amurensis), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
introduced as veliger larvae in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986, was first discovered in Suisun Bay during October 1986. By June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1987, the Asian clam was widespread in Suisun, San Pablo, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bays irrespective of salinity, water depth, and sediment type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at densities greater than 10,000 individuals per square meter. Asian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clam densities declined to 4,000 individuals per square meter as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population aged during the year (Carlton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Persistently low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river outflow and concomitant elevated salinity levels may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributed to this species' population explosion (Carlton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Asian clam could potentially play an important role in affecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phytoplankton dynamics in the Estuary. The clam may have an effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher trophic levels by decreasing phytoplankton biomass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Eurytemora affinis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the native euryhaline copepod,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail have declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This species has been extirpated from portions of its range. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary during the past 2 decades, the entrapment zone, associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the important nurseries for splittail, has been more frequently shifted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream to a confined area of greater depth as a result of drought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, water management schedules, and the continual and increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand for water exports and diversions. These factors will continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affect all life stages of splittail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Threatened status is proposed for the Sacramento splittail because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of several factors. The population has declined by 62 percent within 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. The historical and current range of the species is constricted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in water salinity and the reverse flow of water has shifted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of individuals upstream and has caused the fish to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerable to State and Federal pumping plants. The death of these fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to pumping continues at present and is likely to continue in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. Water exports also threaten the quality and quantity of habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at present and for the future. Because Sacramento splittail are long-lived, their decline has been gradual, and extinction
is not imminent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing the splittail as endangered would not be appropriate. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this species is not in imminent danger of extinction at this time, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the evaluation of all available information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundance, present distribution, and threats to this species, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service has determined that proposing to list the Sacramento splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as threatened is appropriate at this time. Critical habitat is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinable for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrently with proposing a species to be endangered or threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that designation of critical habitat for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail is not determinable at this time. Regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 CFR 424.12(a)(2) state that critical habitat is not determinable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not sufficiently known to permit identification of an area of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. The Service's efforts to gather information on the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of designating critical habitat for splittail may lead to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that designation of critical habitat is not prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1) state that a designation of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat is not prudent when the species is threatened by taking or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or when such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation would not be beneficial to the species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal actions that may affect the splittail or its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized, carried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Marine Fisheries Service, and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are found to be inadequate. In 1991, EPA disapproved portions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has published in this same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 separate part proposed replacement standards for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4 of the Act, listing the splittail will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional impetus for the development of a recovery plan to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together Federal, State, and private efforts to develop conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies for this species. The Service has convened the Delta Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishes in the Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery of the splittail and other fishes native to the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem also will be described in this plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened wildlife not covered by a special rule. These prohibitions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of the United States to take (including harass, harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interstate or foreign commerce any such species. It also is illegal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service and State conservation agencies.

The Service intends that any final action resulting from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly are sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any threat (or lack thereof) to this species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The location and status of any additional populations of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biological information that would be useful in determining whether to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate critical habitat includes descriptions and locations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning habitat and life history information on behavior and ecological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population size of this species; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible impacts on this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the

comments and any additional information received by the Service, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such communications may lead to final regulations that differ from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 1-year finding on a petition to list the longfin smelt (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Spirinchus thaleichthys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service determines that the petitioned action is
not warranted at this time. The longfin smelt occurs from the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary
in California to Prince William Sound in Alaska. Although the southernmost populations are declining, little or
no population trend data are available for estuaries in Oregon and Washington. The species may be surviving and reproducing
in Puget Sound, Skagit Bay, Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the Columbia River, Yaquina Bay, and Coos Bay. Large numbers
are found in the Gulf of Alaska 5 to 6 miles off shore. The listing of a Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary vertebrate
population segment is also not warranted at this time because that population does not seem to be biologically significant
to the species as a whole, and may not be sufficiently reproductively isolated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 5, 1992, the Service received a petition from Mr. Gregory A. Thomas of the Natural Heritage Institute to
add the longfin smelt to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate critical habitat in the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers and estuary. In his letter, Mr. Thomas identified the following eight organizations as co-petitioners:
American Fisheries Society, Bay Institute of San Francisco, Natural Heritage Institute, Planning and Conservation
League, Save San Francisco Bay Association, Friends of the River, San Francisco Baykeeper, and the Sierra Club. On
June 24, 1993, the Service issued a 90-day finding, a notice of which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36184), that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted. The Service initiated a status review and analyzed available data on this species (Meng 1993).
Additional sources of information describing the human factors and projects that may affect this species include
expert testimonies presented to the California State Water Resources Control Board's 1987 Water Quality/Water
Rights Proceeding on the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and 1992 Water Rights Phase of the
Bay-Delta Estuary Proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that the Service issue a finding within 1 year of the receipt of the petition
on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded from immediate
proposal by other pending proposals of higher priority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In casual conversations, the petitioner indicated that he intended the petition to be a request to list the Sacramento-San
Joaquin River estuary population. However, the Service did not receive this request in writing and, in any case, was
required to review the status of the species on a rangewide basis prior to considering the appropriateness of listing
individual population segments. The Service determines that listing of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary population
segment of the longfin smelt is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Longfin smelt is an euryhaline species with a 2-year life cycle (Moyle 1976, Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Spawning occurs
in fresh water over sandy-gravel substrates, rocks, or aquatic plants. Spawning may take place as early as November
and extend into June, although the peak spawning period is from February to April (Wang 1986). After hatching, larvae
move up into surface waters and are transported downstream into brackish-water nursery areas. Sacramento-San Joaquin
River outflow into Suisun and San Pablo Bays has been positively correlated with longfin smelt recruitment (Stevens
and Miller 1983) because higher outflow increases larval dispersal and the area available for rearing (Wang 1986).
The main food of longfin smelt is opossum shrimp, although copepods and other crustaceans also are eaten (Moyle 1976).
Longfin smelt are preyed upon by fishes, birds, and marine mammals (Monaco et al. 1991). Longfin smelt play a role in
maintaining the structure and function of estuarine ecosystems because they are important as food for birds and piscivorous
fishes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As presently described, longfin smelt range from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River estuary and South San Francisco
Bay, California, to Prince William Sound, Alaska (Miller and Lea 1972). The present-day distribution of longfin
smelt is probably due to lower sea levels in the Pleistocene, which would have enlarged estuaries up and down the Pacific
coast and shortened the distances between estuaries, as well as provide more habitat (Peter Moyle, University of
California, Davis, pers. comm., 1993). Unverified reports of off-shore collection of longfin smelt exist, approximately
5 to 6 miles off shore in Alaska (Bruce Wing, National Marine Fisheries Service, Auke Bay, Alaska, pers. comm., 1993)
and 3 to 4 miles off shore in northern California (Larry Quirollo, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm.,
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on inferred abundance, longfin smelt may be common in Willapa Bay, Skagit Bay, and Puget Sound in Washington
and Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay in Oregon (Monaco 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Largely using sampling data, Monaco 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1990) also reported that longfin smelt were common to highly abundant in the Columbia River and Grays Harbor, Washington.
Few data exist on the recent status of the Oregon and Washington longfin smelt; however, indications are that this
species may be reproducing and surviving in the Oregon and Washington estuaries (Bob Emmett, National Marine Fisheries
Service, Hammond, Oregon, pers. comm., 1993). A land-locked population exists in Harrison Lake in British Columbia.
British Columbia longfin smelt have also been recorded at the Fraser River estuary and near Prince Rupert and Vancouver
(Hart 1973). Alaska longfin smelt are found at the Dixon Entrance, Yakutat Bay, Prince William Sound, and Cook Inlet
(Wing, pers. comm., 1993). In California, the longfin smelt occurs (or did occur) in the Klamath River mouth, Humboldt
Bay, Eel River mouth, Van Duzen River mouth, and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary (Moyle 1976;
Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992; Ron Fritzsche, Humboldt State University, pers. comm., 1993). The Estuary supports the
largest and most southerly longfin smelt population in California (Lee

1980).

The strongest information on the decline of longfin smelt comes from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary of
California. Longfin smelt were once one of the most abundant fish caught by trawl surveys in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
(Herbold

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992) and Humboldt Bay estuaries (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993). Longfin smelt numbers in the Estuary fluctuated
widely in the past, but since 1983 abundance has dropped dramatically and remained at record lows. In Humboldt Bay,
longfin smelt were the fourth most abundant fish captured in trawls in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Roger Barnhart,
National Biological Survey, pers. comm., 1993). However, since 1988, no longfin smelt have been captured in Humboldt
Bay using similar sampling methods (Tim Mulligan, Humboldt State University, pers. comm., 1993). Historical records
of longfin smelt from the mouth of the Van Duzen River exist; however, in recent years, no evidence of the fish exists
for this location (Fritzsche, pers. comm., 1993). The Eel River, which is about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) from Humboldt
Bay, is relatively small and probably contains little habitat appropriate for longfin smelt. Longfin smelt likely
occurred in the Eel River only when high river outflows introduced fish from Humboldt Bay. Longfin smelt numbers probably
declined in the Eel River at the same time declines occurred in Humboldt Bay. Recent surveys have not found the longfin
in the Eel estuary (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993). In Oregon and Washington, no population trend data exist for any of the
estuaries, although the indications are that the species is surviving and reproducing in several estuaries (Emmett,
pers. comm., 1993). In Alaska, large numbers of longfin smelt are found in the Gulf of Alaska (Bruce Wing, National
Marine Fisheries Service, pers. comm., 1993).

In the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary the decline in longfin smelt abundance is associated with fresh water
diversions from the Delta to support California's agricultural industry in the Central Valley and the vast urban
areas of southern California. Strong relationships between outflow and longfin smelt abundance indicate that outflows
less than 3,400 cubic feet per second (cfs) result in reproductive failure for longfin smelt (Moyle and Yoshiyama
1992). Because of its 2-year life span, such flows for more than 2 or 3 consecutive years could push this species toward
extinction. From 1986 to 1991, outflows hovered close to that number, partly due to high proportions of inflow diverted.
Movement of the entrapment zone (mixing zone at the freshwater-saltwater interface) up-river due to low outflows
has constricted the range of the longfin smelt and made it increasingly vulnerable to diversion into man-made structures.
Low outflows have failed to disperse larvae downstream to the productive nursery areas in Suisun Bay away from the
pumps. The water exports from the Delta by far exceed those from any other estuary on the west coast of North America.

Sediment production as a result of human activities and developments in the Humboldt, Eel, Van Duzen, and Klamath
watersheds may be a cause of the decline of longfin smelt in those estuaries. Soil washed into the streams can deposit
in estuaries downstream. Sedimentation in the spawning habitat could have reduced the spawning success of this species
due to physical scouring or suffocation of eggs (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993). Although human activities upstream
of estuaries in Oregon, Washington, Canada, and Alaska would likely result in similar impacts, the Service does not
have population trend data for these portions of the species' range.

Longfin smelt disappeared from the Humboldt Bay estuary in the 1980s (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993), perhaps as a result
of a dramatic loss of intertidal marsh habitat, which may have reduced productivity levels to a point at which they
could no longer support the species. In addition, the loss of freshwater flows from the Mad River, as a result of water
diversions and land reclamation, may have contributed to the loss of this species from the Humboldt Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Longfin smelt may be particularly sensitive to adverse habitat alterations or to stochastic events because their
2-year life cycle increases the likelihood of extinction after consecutive periods of reproductive failure due
to drought or other factors. Relatively brief periods of reproductive failure could lead to extirpations.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in this determination. This species does not appear to be threatened
throughout all or a significant portion of its range or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. However, given
the declines in the southern portion of the species' range and the general lack of population trend data for the remainder
of its range, the Service will include the longfin smelt in category 2 of the next notice of review for animals.

Though the petition was not limited to a portion of the species' range, the petitioner focused on the resident longfin
smelt in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population. In telephone conversations, the petitioner indicated
that he was most interested in a population listing. Longfin smelt numbers in this estuary have declined by 90 percent
since 1984 and by 50 percent annually since 1987.

The Service has listed vertebrate population segments where the entity being listed represented the entire coterminous
United States population (e.g., marbled murrelet, grizzly bear). Some reproductively isolated (or nearly so) vertebrate
population segments that are clearly important to the conservation of an entire species have also been listed under
the Act (e.g., Mojave population of the desert tortoise, coastal population of the western snowy plover).

Although the longfin smelt reportedly is unable to swim between estuaries (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993), unverified
reports of offshore collections exist (Quirollo, pers. comm., 1993; Wing, pers. comm., 1993). Furthermore, the
current distribution is thought to be the result of movements between estuaries that took place during the Pleistocene
when lower sea levels reportedly would have enlarged estuaries along the Pacific coast and shortened the inter-estuarian
distances (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993). Though geographically removed from the closest known extirpated or declining
population (300 miles from the Eel River in California), this isolation does not necessarily indicate that the Sacramento-San
Joaquin River estuary population is significant to a species that has a range of more than 1,900 miles. In addition,
electrophoretic analysis revealed that the accumulated number of codon substitutions per locus (i.e., Nei's genetic
distance) since the time of separation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population and the longfin population
in Lake Washington, Washington, connected to Puget Sound via a system of locks, has been small (0.005 according to

). Thus, these populations, separated by approximately 1,000 miles, have genetically diverged only slightly since
their separation.

The Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary is clearly an important and significant wetland ecosystem. The longfin
smelt formerly was the fourth most abundant fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary; however, the role of
this declining species in the estuary today is unknown.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evaluation the Service has determined that the listing of the longfin smelt under the Act is not warranted
at this time. The listing of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population of the longfin smelt is also not warranted
at this time.
