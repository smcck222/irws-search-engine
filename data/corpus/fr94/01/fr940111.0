SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule broadens the current regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the Food Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Distribution Program for Indian Households in Oklahoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FDPIHO). First, this change mandates that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households which pass the program means test, reside in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated areas near a reservation where an Indian Tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization (ITO) or State agency provides program services, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include a Native American be eligible to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's tribal affiliation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age. Secondly, it also makes such households which lack a Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American adult, but which include Native American children, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible to participate in the FDPIHO. Finally, this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies that all households which pass the program means test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and live on a reservation where an ITO or State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administers the FDPIR, are eligible to receive benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether they contain a Native American.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section of the preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of the provisions,
all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. This includes any administrative procedures provided
by state or local governments. For disputes involving procurements by State agencies or Indian Tribal Organizations,
this includes any administrative appeal procedures to the extent required by 7 CFR 253.5(l), 7 CFR 254.3(a), and 7
CFR part 3016. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), proposed to authorize ITOs and State agencies to serve income-eligible
households residing in near areas which contain an Indian tribal member, regardless of that person's tribal affiliation.
This interim rule will mandate that all such households be provided program benefits upon application. Because the
Department believes that permitting ITOs and State agencies to exclude these Native Americans from program participation
simply because they do not live on a reservation or near their tribe's reservation is inequitable and counter to the
intent of FDPIR, the Administrator of FNS has determined that prior notice and comment on this provision of this rule
would be unnecessary and contrary to public interest. For this reason, the Administrator has determined, in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), that good cause exists to waive the solicitation of public comments prior to implementation.
However, the Department believes this rule may be improved by public comment based on actual operating experience.
Therefore, comments solicited on this rule must be postmarked or submitted on or before March 14, 1994. All comments
will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes to the rule will be incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final
rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) was established by section 4(b) of the Food Stamp Act
of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2013(b)), as an alternative to food stamps for low-income Native Americans who, because
they live on or near Indian reservations in sparsely populated areas, may not have convenient access to food stamp
certification offices or authorized food stamp retailers. However, the current regulatory definition of ``Indian
tribal household'' at 7 CFR 253.2(c) and 254.2(d) renders ineligible certain categories of such Native Americans.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category is comprised of households which lack a Native American adult, but which include Native American
children. Although such households do not exist in large numbers, they reside in many of the areas adjacent to reservations
(i.e., ``near areas'') which Indian Tribal Organizations or State agencies have chosen to serve. Native American
children may be part of a household that lacks a Native American adult due, for example, to death of a parent or divorce.
Also, Native American children may be living with non-Native American foster or adoptive parents. These children
are not necessarily in any less need of the program than children living with Native American adults in near areas,
who may participate. The definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in the FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) requires that all
households residing in a near area have an adult Indian tribal member in order to participate. The definition in the
FDPIHO at 7 CFR 254.2(d) also requires that all households have an adult Indian member in order to participate. Thus,
Native American children in otherwise eligible households are denied access to both of these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second category excluded from participating applies only to FDPIR: Native American households, residing in
near areas, which lack a member of a tribe that is represented by the ITO or State agency administering the program on
the adjacent reservation. The definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 253.2(c) excludes such households,
in effect, due to the combination of their tribal affiliation and where they reside. They could be eligible if they
lived on the reservation in question, or on or near the reservation of the tribe of which they are a member. The Department
believes that exclusion of these Native Americans from program participation simply because they do not live on a
reservation or near their tribe's reservation, is inequitable and counter to the intent of FDPIR. Their Native American
identity and potential need for the program are in no way diminished by their current residence. In contrast, Native
American tribal households residing in any program service area in Oklahoma may participate in FDPIHO regardless
of their tribal affiliation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;253.2(e) of the proposed rule published on October 20, 1987 (52 FR 39158), the Department proposed to amend
the FDPIR definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to give ITOs and State agencies the option to serve a household
which lacks a member of a tribe they represent, but which includes a member of another recognized Indian tribe. All
16 comments received on this proposed change supported it. During its 1992 annual meeting, the National Association
of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations (NAFDPIR) also supported the proposal. In resolution 92&hyph;7,
NAFDPIR supported the broadening of the current definition of ``Indian tribal household'' to include ``any household
in which at least one household member is recognized as an Indian.'' NAFDPIR believes that all Native Americans in
near areas should be eligible to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation as has always been the case in
FDPIHO service areas. The language in the proposed rule addressing this issue is therefore implemented in this interim
rule with two clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in &sect;253.2(c) is revised by changing ``recognized by the
appropriate ITO as a tribal member'' to ``recognized as a tribal member by any Indian tribe as defined in this part.''
This change in definition would make those households containing a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in Section
253.2(d) eligible to apply for FDPIR without regard to whether the person is a member of a tribe represented by the ITO
or State agency administering the program in the near area. Thus, based on the definition of ``Indian tribe,'' any
household containing a person belonging to any Indian tribe, band, or other organized Indian group on a reservation
which is recognized as eligible for Federal programs and services provided to Indians, or which holds a treaty with
a State government, would be eligible to receive FDPIR benefits if he/she also meets the income eligibility requirements.
This same amendment is made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' in &sect;254.2(d) of the FDPIHO regulations.
However, in the FDPIHO, income-eligible Native American households residing in any program service area in the State
have always been permitted to participate regardless of their tribal affiliation. Therefore, this amendment as
applied to FDPIHO constitutes a clarification only and not, as in the case of the FDPIR, a substantive change which
affects program eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, &sect;253.6(b)(1) is changed to clarify that all households which pass the program means test, reside in
near areas and include a Native American must be allowed to participate in the FDPIR, regardless of the Native American's
specific tribal affiliation. Thus, if a household member can obtain documentation from his/her tribe of origin that
he/she is recognized as a member of an ``Indian tribe'' as defined in &sect;253.2(d), the ITO or State agency administering
the program in the near area must accept that recognition for purposes of program eligibility. The ITO or State agency
itself has no discretion to decide which tribes it will recognize in the near area. It should be pointed out that the
ITO or State agency also has no discretion to decide issues of tribal membership since each Indian tribe has always
been responsible for defining its own members. Thus, for eligibility purposes, the ITO or State agency simply makes
a determination as to whether or not an applicant household has official documentation of membership from its tribe
of origin. If the tribe of origin is an ``Indian tribe,'' as defined in &sect;253.2(d), the ITO or State agency must
serve the household as long as it meets all other FDPIR eligibility requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 20, 1987, proposed rule did not clearly propose to mandate that all households with Indian tribal members
be eligible for program benefits in near areas. Rather, its thrust was to remove a regulatory barrier to participation
of such households. Thus the language authorized ITOs and State agencies to serve such households. Upon further consideration
of the issue, the Department has concluded that ITOs or State agencies themselves should not be in a position to impose
barriers to participation based on the tribal affiliation of a member of a household residing in a near area. Therefore,
this interim rule mandates that such households be served under the program if they are determined income-eligible,
rather than permitting the administering agency to serve them at its discretion. Given the shift from allowing such
households to be served in the proposed rule to mandating that they be served, the Department is publishing this rule
as an interim regulation with provision for public comment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current FDPIR regulations do not clearly state that non-Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American households living on the reservation who meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program means test are eligible to receive program benefits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although this has always been the policy under which FDPIR has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated on all participating reservations. While the 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule did not specifically address this issue, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule does so in order to formalize and clarify what has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always been household eligibility policy and practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, &sect;253.6(b)(1) is revised to clarify that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households living on the reservation, and meeting the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means test, are eligible to receive program benefits, even if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they do not contain a Native American. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1987 proposed rule did not specifically propose to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDPIR requirement that households living in a near area must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an adult Native American in order to be eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in FDPIR. However, in the preamble, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that this suggestion had been made, summarized the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason for such a change, and solicited comments to determine how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive this problem is and whether others believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the definition is necessary. Nineteen of the 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received in response to this solicitation supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of the requirement. Accordingly, the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Indian tribal household'' in FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule reads as follows: ``a household in which at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one household member is recognized as a tribal member by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indian tribe, as defined in this part.'' This same amendment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
254.2(d). Since the requirement that the household include an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adult Native American in order to be eligible also exists in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDPIHO, the change will have the same remedial effect in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 906, as amended (7 CFR part 906), regulating
the handling of oranges and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the
order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 15 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges and grapefruit
grown in Texas, and about 750 producers of oranges and grapefruit in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been
defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee, which administers the order locally, meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations
effective on a continuous basis for each citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the
public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations,
information submitted by the committee and other information, to determine whether modification, suspension,
or termination of the handling regulation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on October 18, 1993, with an effective date of October 25, 1993, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 54925, October 25, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 24, 1993,
and no comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4) of &sect;906.365 by temporarily relaxing the minimum size requirement
to permit shipment of grapefruit measuring at least 35/16 inches in diameter (pack size 112) for the entire 1993&hyph;94
season ending July 31, 1994, provided such grapefruit grade at least U.S. No. 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This relaxation is expected to help the Texas citrus industry successfully market its 1993&hyph;94 season grapefruit
crop and have a positive effect on producer returns. Permitting shipment of pack size 112 grapefruit grading at least
U.S. No. 1 for the entire 1993&hyph;94 season will enable Texas grapefruit handlers to meet market needs and compete
with similar sized grapefruit expected to be shipped from Florida. This action is based on the current and prospective
crop and market conditions for Texas grapefruit. Fresh Texas grapefruit shipments began in mid-September this season.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule also removed paragraph (c) of &sect;906.365. That paragraph set forth quality requirements
for oranges and grapefruit which were in effect through February 15, 1992. Thus, the provisions in that paragraph
were obsolete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas grapefruit shipments to fresh markets in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are subject to handling requirements
effective under this order. Exempt from such handling requirements are shipments made: (1) Within the production
area in Texas; (2) in individually addressed gift packages aggregating not more than 500 pounds which are not for resale;
(3) under the 400 pound minimum quantity exemption provision; and (4) for relief, charity, and home use. In addition,
fruit shipped to approved processors located outside of the production area may be exempted from the handling requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the relaxed requirements
set forth in the interim final rule. The Department believes that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers
and handlers because it will permit 1993&hyph;94 season grapefruit shipments consistent with anticipated crop
and market conditions. The application of handling requirements to Texas grapefruit over the years has been beneficial
to the Texas citrus industry in marketing its crops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the relaxation set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act.

 This rule finalizes without change an interim final rule which revised the handling requirements for Texas oranges
and grapefruit to require handlers to ensure that an inspection certificate accompanies each shipment of fruit when
it is transported by motor vehicle, and that such inspection certificates are surrendered upon leaving the production
area when requested by Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) road guard station personnel designated as agents of
the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee). This revision was designed to help the Texas citrus industry ensure
that all fresh oranges and grapefruit are inspected prior to shipment from the production area.

requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 750 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the
Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and
small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee met on August 3, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;906.365 to require
handlers to ensure that an inspection certificate accompanies each shipment of fruit when it is transported by motor
vehicle, and that such inspection certificates are surrendered upon leaving the production area when requested
by Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) road guard station personnel designated as agents of the committee. The
committee meets prior to and during each season to review the handling regulations effective on a continuous basis
for fruit regulated under the marketing order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons
may express their views at these meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended this action after discussions with TDA road guard station personnel on the subject of operating
road guard stations located on the major roads leading out of the production area for Texas oranges and grapefruit.
TDA informed the committee that, heretofore, TDA road guard station personnel had not been authorized to require
handlers to surrender a copy of their inspection certificates to them, when checking fruit being transported from
the production area to determine if it had been inspected and certified as meeting order requirements. Requiring
handlers to surrender a copy of their inspection certificates to the TDA will enable TDA personnel to determine whether
the fruit meets order requirements, thereby helping ensure compliance with order provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, to
determine whether modification, suspension, or termination of the handling regulation is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on October 4, 1993, with an effective date of October 8, 1993, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 52400, October 8, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-comment period ending November 8, 1993, and no
comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule amended &sect;906.365 by adding the following sentence at the end of paragraph (a)(5). ``No
handler may transport by motor vehicle or cause the transportation of any shipment of fruit for which an inspection
certificate is required unless each such shipment is accompanied by a copy of the inspection certificate applicable
thereto, and a copy of such inspection certificate is surrendered upon request to Texas Department of Agriculture
Road Guard personnel as designated by the committee.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revision of handling
requirements set forth in the interim final rule. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial
impact on producers and handlers, since it will authorize TDA road guard station personnel to require surrender of
inspection certificates upon leaving the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

 This interim final rule amends a previous interim final rule which authorized administrative expenses for the South
Texas Onion Committee (Committee) under M.O. No. 959. This interim final rule increases the level of authorized expenses
and establishes an increased assessment rate to generate funds to pay those expenses. Authorization of this increased
budget enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds
to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Order No. 959, both as amended (7 CFR part 959), regulating
the handling of onions grown in South Texas. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, South Texas onions are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable onions handled during the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period,
which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 47 producers of South Texas onions under this marketing order, and approximately 34 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $3,500,000. The majority of South Texas onion producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period was prepared by the South Texas Onion Committee, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for
approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of South Texas onions. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of South Texas onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 for personnel, office, and compliance expenses were recommended
in a mail vote completed August 4, 1993. The assessment rate and funding for the research and promotion projects were
to be recommended at a later Committee meeting. The Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 were published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an interim final rule September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50509). That interim final rule added &sect;959.234, authorizing
expenses for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments through October 28, 1993. No
comments were filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee subsequently met on November 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended increases of $2,500 for personnel
expenses and $125,000 for compliance activities in the recently approved 1993&hyph;94 budget. The compliance increase
will provide for funds to operate road guard stations surrounding the production area. The Committee also unanimously
recommended $210,000 in market development activities and $105,600 in production research. These expenditures
represent increases over last year's budget of $65,000 for market development and $11,412 for production research.
Under this amended budget, expense items for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period are as follows: $37,472 for personnel,
$29,028 for office expenses, $141,000 for compliance activities, $210,000 for market development, and $105,600
for production research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial 1994 budget, published on September 28, 1993, did not establish an assessment rate. Therefore, the Committee
also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per 50-pound container or equivalent of onions, $0.03 more
than last year's assessment rate. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of approximately 5 million 50-pound
containers or equivalents, will yield $500,000 in assessment income, which, along with $23,100 from the reserve,
will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve as of September 30, 1993, were $346,415, which is
within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period began on August 1, 1993, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to that taken for the 1992&hyph;93
fiscal period; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received
will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 966 and 984 for
the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Florida Tomato Committee and the Walnut
Marketing Board (Committee and Board) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the programs.
Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 125 and Order No. 966, both as amended (7 CFR part 966), regulating
the handling of tomatoes grown in Florida; and Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984),
regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreements and orders are effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Florida tomatoes and California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal period, which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 250 producers of Florida tomatoes under Marketing Order 966, and approximately 50 handlers.
Also, there are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under Marketing Order 984, and approximately
65 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budgets of expenses for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period were prepared by the Committee and the Board, the agencies
responsible for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Florida Tomato Committee are producers. The members of the California Walnut Board are producers
and handlers. They are familiar with the Committee's and Board's needs and with the costs for goods and services in
their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed
in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input
into these processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee and Board expenses by expected
respective shipments of Florida tomatoes and merchantable California walnuts. Because these rates will be applied
to actual shipments of tomatoes and of certified merchantable walnuts, the assessment rates must be established
at levels that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's and Board's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Tomato Committee met September 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $2,682,000,
which is $4,000 less than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $6,250 for office rent, $200
for miscellaneous, and $4,000 for research expense, will be offset by decreases of $7,000 for office salaries and
$7,450 for employees' retirement program. Major expense items include $276,000 for office salaries, $200,000 for
research expense, and $2,000,000 for education and promotion expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.04 per 25-pound container, the same as last year.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 58,000,000 25-pound containers, will yield $2,320,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $20,000 in interest and other income and $342,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve,
will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve at the beginning of the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal period were $1,349,348, which is within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Walnut Marketing Board met September 10, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $1,941,647,
$69,551 more than the previous year. Increases include $4,511 for administrative salaries, $171 for general insurance,
$200 for audit, $7,649 for group life, retirement, and medical plan, $835 for office salaries, $7,904 for office rent,
$6,000 for office supplies and miscellaneous, $1,000 for telephone and FAX, $2,000 for equipment maintenance and
warranties, $9,000 for furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $7,450 for production research director, and the
addition of a $43,000 acreage survey category. These increases will be partially offset by decreases of $300 for social
security and hospital insurance taxes, $5,000 for domestic market research and development, and $14,869 for production
research. Major expenses include $101,331 for administrative salaries, $40,771 for office salaries, $875,000
for domestic market research and development, $490,488 for production research, $91,068 for production research
director, and $43,000 for a walnut acreage survey. A reserve for contingencies of $50,000 is also included in the 1993&hyph;94
budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.009 per kernelweight pound, $0.001 less than the
previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 2,157,386 kernelweight pounds of merchantable
walnuts, will yield $1,941,647 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended
funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available
to the handlers from whom collected within that period.

added &sect;966.231 and &sect;984.344 which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committee
and Board. Those rules provided that interested persons could file comments through November 26, 1993, for 7 CFR part
966 and through November 29, 1993, for 7 CFR part 984. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely
to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee and Board need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred
on a continuous basis. The 1993&hyph;94 fiscal periods for the programs began on August 1, 1993. The marketing orders
require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods apply to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during
the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committee and Board
at public meetings and published in the

immigration benefits. This initiative has already led to a number of steps which have begun to significantly improve
efficiency and the quality of service provided to the public.

A number of comments were received about this proposal. Many were prepared by a working group of interested organizations.
The following sections discuss the comments and explain the revisions adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters opposed the proposed requirement that an applicant or petitioner sing Form G&hyph;28, Notice
of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, to show that he or she authorized the representation. For example,
one commenter argued that an attorney's indication that he or she represents someone should be accepted as ``absolutely
definitive evidence'' since submission by an attorney where not so authorized would be a violation of his or her ethical
and legal obligations, and would subject him or her to disciplinary action and a malpractice suit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a number of other commenters within the industry supported the new requirement. Some pointed out that the
form is not only used by attorneys. Others noted that requiring the signature can help combat the unauthorized practice
of law. Still others felt that the signature would address potential Privacy Act concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons given by those supporting the new requirement, as well a those enumerated in the proposed rule, this
proposal has been retained. An applicant or petitioner must sign the Form G&hyph;28 to definitively indicate to the
Service that he or she has authorized the person to represent him or her in the proceeding. The person submitting the
Form G&hyph;28 must be authorized under 8 CFR part 292 to represent the applicant or petitioner. Where a Form G&hyph;28
is submitted that is not properly signed, the application or petition will be processed as if a Form G&hyph;28 had not
been submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where an applicant or petitioner has an authorized representative, the Service now mails two copies of each written
notice. One goes to the applicant or petitioner, and the other goes to the authorized representative. The proposed
rule suggested sending only one notice in such a case, and sending it to the representative. This would have meant that
the Service would communicate with the applicant or petitioner through his or her authorized representative if he
or she had one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters pointed to past problems in representatives receiving their copy, and argued that separate notices
should be continued as a safeguard. After review, the Service will therefore continue to send separate notices to
the applicant or petitioner and his or her authorized representative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters also asked that the Service begin sending copies of notices to anyone assisting an applicant or
petitioner, and not simply to authorized representatives. However, while the Service cannot limit or control who
can assist others in filling out and filing an application or petition, only a person who meets the criteria in 8 CFR
parts 1 and 292 can act as the applicant or petitioner's authorized representative and submit a Form G&hyph;28. A person
who does not meet these criteria cannot represent the applicant or petitioner, and cannot be notified of any action
taken on the application or petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters opposed the proposed modification of when the Service would send a notice by certified mail. After
review, this proposal has been withdrawn.

Filing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters requested that additional filing instructions be included on forms to eliminate confusion
about where to file. Last year the Service began to include such specific information on the new generation of application
and petition forms. This process will continue as older versions of forms are replaced or eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that application and petition forms be published for public comment since the instructions
have the effect of regulation. All form revisions are carefully reviewed to ensure they are consistent with regulations.
In addition to informally circulating significant changes to forms for comment, the Service intends to begin to publish
form revisions as required and as deemed necessary for effective communications. The Service is committed to revising
forms on a more frequent basis to keep up with ever changing immigration laws and changes in procedures. The Service
wants to assist people in learning about immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and help them understand
what is required to file a complete application. This will facilitate quicker processing and minimize the delays
and additional processing costs associated with requests for more information or evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As suggested by many commenters, language has been added to clarify that a child can file an application or petition
for himself or herself, in addition to allowing a parent or legal guardian to file. Other commenters suggested that
anyone be allowed to file such a petition, pointing to 8 CFR 101.6(b)(1), which permits such a broad group of persons
to file petitions for juveniles dependent on a juvenile court in the United States. However, except for these unique
circumstances, there is no valid reason to allow a person who has no legal authority over a child to assume the right
to act in the child's behalf before the Service. Therefore, this suggestion has not been adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to allow the filing of photocopies of documents with applications and petitions instead of originals
was universally applauded as a significant step in streamlining filing procedures. However, one commenter asked
whether each copy would need to be certified that it is exact and unaltered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence submitted in the context of an application or petition is part of that application or petition. See 8 CFR 270.1.
By signing the application or petition form, the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the application or
petition, and all evidence submitted with it, is true and correct. The rule has been clarified to indicate that a separate
certification for each copy is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the rule be revised so that in cases where an applicant or petitioner submits an original
when he or she could have submitted a copy, the Service would be required to make the copy and return the original.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes that people need to retain original documents for their records. This was one of the primary
reasons why the Service made the decision to accept photocopies. However, the Service processes over 4 million applications
and petitions each year. In cases where a person chooses to submit originals instead of copies, the Service is not in
a position to make the copies for him or her so the originals can be returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provided that where the Service determines a need to review the original of a document, the applicant
or petitioner would have 30 days to submit the original document. Several commenters suggested that 30 days does not
allow enough time, since people might not have the document and would have to get one from the issuing authority. They
suggested a 60 or 90-day period instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The idea of allowing copies was proposed so applicants and petitioners can file a copy and keep the original, not so
they can file a copy because they don't have an original. By filing a copy as part of their application or petition, they
are attesting that the copy is true and correct. This would be problematic if they do not have an original. However,
to minimize confusion and to standardize the various response periods provided in this rule, the final rule provides
12 weeks, without extension, for submission of an original document. If an applicant or petitioner does not submit
the requested original document within that 12-week period, the application or petition will be denied for failure
to provide the original.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the Service begin to accept copies and computer-generated versions of application
and petition forms, and to allow filing by facsimile. The Service will accept photocopies and computer-generated
versions that are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
identical
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to Service forms in all respects, including placement, perforations and fastener holes. We cannot accept facsimiles
because they do not meet these requirements. It is essential that the forms not vary in any way from the original since
the Service is introducing imaging systems and other systems to speed processing that depend on exact form specifications.
The Service is also very interested in electronic filing as a way of speeding processing and reducing costs, and is
researching various technologies that would allow such filing with fee transmittal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Almost every commenter discussed the initial evidence rules, which proposed that an application or petition filed
without the evidence required by the instructions on the application or petition form would be denied, but without
prejudice to the later filing of a complete application or petition. A number of commenters agreed that the proposal
would reduce the percentage of cases in which the Service has to ask for more evidence during the adjudications process,
and thus review twice, and that this would help speed overall processing times. Several commenters noted that the
additional explanations on the new application and petition forms of what evidence is required will help people to
file complete applications and petitions. Others supported threshold standards for filing. However, a number of
commenters had serious reservations about the initial evidence requirements described in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Service should help applicants and petitioners correct cases that lack the
required initial evidence rather than require them to start over and file again. Others suggested the proposed rule
did not sufficiently recognize that some people may unintentionally fail to file the required initial evidence.
A few suggested that while the Service should deny clearly deficient cases, it should not deny ``marginal'' cases,
but should give those people a chance to correct their cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the Service continue to add evidence explanations to its new forms, but only monitor
the effect and not implement procedures to deny incomplete applications. Another commenter, who opposed the entire
concept of threshold requirements, asserted that allowing the Service to deny an application or petition for lack
of initial evidence would give it ``unbridled'' discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial evidence is the evidence necessary to establish a basis for filing and to allow the Service to process the average
case through to completion the first time. As indicated by many commenters, it is in the best interest of applicants
and petitioners, as well as in the interest of the Service, that an application or petition be complete when first filed
so a decision can be entered quickly and correctly, without delays caused by having to go back and ask an applicant or
petitioner for more evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial evidence explanations included in revised application and petition forms are designed to help people
know what types of basic evidence they should always submit with their application or petition. The explanations
also clarify statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria by translating them into more concrete terms. The question
here is what the Service should do when someone files without the required threshold evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most basic issues in processing an application or petition for an immigration benefit are determining eligibility
for the benefit, and treating all applicants and petitioners fairly and equitably. Among other things, this means
using processing systems that ensure that cases are not processed in a way that enables one applicant or petitioner
to derive an unfair advantage over another applying for the same benefit. For example, this means ensuring that priority
dates for immigration and case processing dates are accorded in ways that do not encourage a person to file an incomplete
application as a means of stepping in line in front of someone else who waits to obtain all the necessary evidence before
filing. It also means establishing processing parameters to minimize instances where the Service has to handle repeatedly
an application because basic documents are missing. This increases average processing time, and raises costs which
are transferred to all applicants through filing fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Service recognizes that these processes must operate in an environment in which a significant number
of applicants and petitioners are unfamiliar with the English language and government requirements. The Service's
goal is to recognize the needs of the population we serve while setting processing parameters that allow the agency
to process applications quickly, correctly and fairly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, most applications were submitted in person at a local Service office. This provided an opportunity to
review the application, and not accept it at that time if it lacked necessary evidence. However, this has led to occasions
where discrepancies in local acceptance standards have been alleged. In order to make filing easier as the volume
of applications has grown, and to make processing more consistent, the Service has moved towards a mail-in process.
Since advance review is not possible in such a situation, there must be clear guidelines for handling cases filed without
necessary evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has revised the initial evidence process as a result of the comments received. In general, the Service
will not deny a case for lack of initial evidence. An application or petition will be reviewed after fee receipting.
If required initial evidence is missing and there is no evidence of ineligibility in the record, the applicant or petitioner
will be notified and given 12 weeks from the date of the notice, without extension, to submit the missing initial evidence.
However, if the application is pre-screened by INS prior to its submission, such as in a situation where the person
files the application in person, and the person insists on filing the application even though necessary initial evidence
is missing, the case shall be denied for lack of required initial evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does require that where the Service requests evidence after filing, it must be submitted in one response.
In addition, as requested by a commenter, it clarifies that a case that is missing initial evidence will not result
in the loss of its priority date until a final decision is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised process encourages applicants and petitioners to obtain the necessary threshold evidence before filing
so that their case can be processed in order and without delay. However, it also allows people who fail to file this threshold
evidence a limited period to submit the missing evidence. A time limit of 12 weeks was set because while the Service
wants to afford people an opportunity to correct a filing deficiency, we must balance that with ensuring that the process
does not encourage people to file before they have a complete application or petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an applicant or petitioner does not submit the missing initial evidence within the time limit, the application
or petition will be automatically denied for lack of initial evidence. While the rule clarifies that an applicant
or petitioner may immediately refile after such a denial, it should be noted that if the subsequent case is filed without
the required initial evidence, it may be denied without a grace period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this process will normally be sufficient, there are situations where a person's immediate status in the United
States hinges on the application or petition, or he or she becomes entitled to a benefit because the case is pending.
For example, a person who files for adjustment of status would in certain instances be able to obtain an advance parole
to travel based on the pending application. An applicant for an employment authorization document may be entitled
to interim employment authorization because the Service cannot make a decision within a certain period. Applying
the general process outlined above in such situations would allow a person to obtain interim benefits based on an incomplete
application or petition while the Service waits for him or her to submit the necessary initial evidence, or because
he or she asks that an interview be rescheduled, delaying processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of an application or petition without the required initial evidence, or asking that a case be rescheduled,
effectively hampers our ability to make a definitive determination of eligibility. An applicant or petitioner may
not be allowed to either inadvertently or intentionally hamper the Service's ability to render a decision and as a
result gain a potential or actual benefit. Therefore, the Service considers processing time for any application
or petition to refer to time unhampered by the applicant or petitioner's action or lack of required action. This means
there is nothing under the applicant or petitioner's control that hampers our ability to make a final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the process outlined earlier, filing an application or petition without required initial evidence hampers
the Service's ability to render a final decision. Similarly, requesting a scheduled interview be rescheduled will
delay full adjudication of a request for benefits, and will require the Service to duplicate several processing and
review steps. The process must balance the need to ensure that persons do not receive undue interim benefits with the
need to ensure that any applicable statutory or regulatory processing timeframes are adhered to once we are no longer
hampered from making a decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in such circumstances the processing clock will stop with respect to any time limits for adjudicating
the request for Service action at the time the Service sends a notice for initial evidence, and it will start over at
the time the Service receives the evidence. Similarly, the processing clock will start over when the Service receives
a request to reschedule an interview. The clock stops because the lack of required initial evidence or request for
rescheduling hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. It starts over again because to merely have it
resume would effectively shorten the Service's processing window because we have to duplicate several processing
and review steps because the application or petition was not complete when submitted or because we were asked to reschedule
the interview. Having the clock start over also serves to encourage the filing of complete applications, which, as
indicated above, is in the legitimate interests of all applicants and petitioners as well as in the legitimate interest
of the Service. However, this process also preserves the processing clock concept because it does not suspend the
clock indefinitely until we can resume processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Service is hampered from making a final decision, interim benefits will not be granted based on a case held
in suspense for the submission of requested initial evidence, except that the Service will normally allow the applicant
or person the petition is for to remain in the country while an application or petition to extend or obtain status while
it is pending. In addition, employment authorization previously accorded based on the same status and employment
as that requested in the current application or petition may continue uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20)
notwithstanding the case being held in suspense for the submission of necessary initial evidence. The Service of
course reserves the right to pursue other actions to seek the removal of persons notwithstanding a pending application
where required, such as in cases involving fraud or clearly frivolous applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also provides for denial where evidence submitted later does not establish eligibility at the time of filing.
The evidence must establish that the applicant or petitioner was eligible for the benefit when the application or
petition was filed. As suggested, the Service will monitor the rate of cases in which initial evidence is not submitted
at the time of filing as a way of determining how we can further clarify form instructions, and to determine if we need
to implement other changes, including those originally proposed in the rule, in order to ensure equity and fairness
to all applicants and petitioners.

Additional Evidence, Documents and Translations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At times, an application or petition will meet threshold evidence requirements, but the evidence submitted, or other
evidence available, rises additional questions. In such instances the Service usually provides the applicant or
petitioner an opportunity to respond or to submit additional evidence about the points in question in support of the
claim. Several commenters asked that the Service extend the 60-day period provided for response, as least where good
cause was demonstrated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule has been revised to provide 12 weeks for such submissions. However, waiting for the applicant or petitioner
to respond hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. Since the applicant has already met the threshold
evidence requirements, the processing clock will merely stop as of the date of the request. It will resume at the point
where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or a request for a decision based on the evidence
submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserted that the Service should eliminate the distinction between primary and secondary evidence,
and accept any type of credible document with an application or petition. However, historically there have been serious
problems establishing the reliability of many kinds of documents. Further, it is important in judging a claim to know
whether documents that should normally exist actually do.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a woman who files a petition claiming someone is her adult son. There is no birth certificate or other civil
or religious documents from around the time of the birth to support the claim, but she does have several documents issued
years later that suggest that he is her son. After analysis the Service may accept the claim, but the fact the birth certificate
and other documents dating from the birth do not exist is important to that analysis. We could not adequately review
the case if the record was silent about the types of documents that commonly exist. Without evidentiary guidelines,
the Service also would not know whether she merely forgot to attach them or whether they did not exist. This would mean
the Service would have to go back and ask, delaying processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as requested by several commenters, the Service has clarified the distinction between primary evidence,
secondary evidence and affidavits. The Service has also clarified the rule to indicate that a certification from
an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's Foreign
Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. The Service has also revised the rule as requested
to allow a person to file evidence showing that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain a required document
or certification of unavailability along with less definitive evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above changes will also apply to secondary evidence. However, because secondary evidence and affidavits are
inherently less reliable and, consequently, have less probative value than primary evidence, such secondary evidence
and affidavits must overcome the fact that more probative primary evidence is unavailable, affidavits must overcome
the absence of all other more probative forms of evidence that would normally be available. If the Service concludes
that primary or secondary evidence should be available, the applicant or petitioner will be asked to obtain it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that the rule be revised to only require a translation of the relevant portion of a foreign
language document instead of a full translation. However, only requiring an extract leaves to the applicant or petitioner
and the translator the judgment of what is germane. The Service has found that in many instances the applicant or petitioner's
determination of what is germane is not consistent with the Service's. A full translation is necessary for us to fully
analyze documents submitted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed the proposed bar to retracting a withdrawal, asserting that an applicant or petitioner may
have a legitimate reason for again changing his or her mind. The rule does not question the legitimacy of a change of
heart or mind, nevertheless, under the rule, a withdrawal is considered definitive. An applicant or petitioner who
withdraws a case and later changes his or her mind again may refile a new application or petition. the Service has clarified
this in the rule, and has also clarified that a petitioner may withdraw an approved petition until such time as the beneficiary
has been admitted or has adjusted status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would allow a motion to reopen a case denied for lack of initial evidence, but would preclude a subsequent
administrative appeal. One commenter suggested that an appeal should be allowed. However, since the issue is simply
whether a stipulated document was or was not submitted, the avenue of a motion is a sufficient safeguard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked that the proposed rule allowing 30 days to file a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider
be extended to 60 days to give applicants and petitioners time to retain legal counsel and file a response. However,
the 30-day period provided is equivalent to that for filing an appeal, which itself was extended several years ago,
and thus will not be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed rule set the level of proof too high for motions to reopen. The provision
has accordingly been revised to clarify the facts that must be demonstrated in the motion. Another commenter asked
that the Service use this rulemaking to make all decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals available to the public.
The concern will be referred to the Executive Office of Immigration Review for future consideration.

Change of Status, Extension of Stay and Use of Form I&hyph;94
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provided that where a person demonstrated eligibility for an extension or change of status, the
application could be approved at the discretion of the Service. One commenter asserted that discretion should not
enter into the decision. However, sections 214 and 248 of the Immigration and Nationality Act give the Service discretionary
authority to approve or deny applications for extension or change of status. In addition, a decision on this type of
application, and on most other types of applications and petitions, is rarely a simple matter. An alien is not automatically
entitled to these types of benefits. The decision to grant a change of status or extension of stay involves weighing
various factors, and a judgement by the deciding official of whether to grant the benefit.

In response to a number of comments, this rule allows a worker's dependents to be included in a company's petition where
there is only one worker in the petition. This provision will go into effect at the time the form providing for this process
becomes available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A person was previously required to submit his or her original Form I&hyph;94, Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Record,
with an application to extend or change nonimmigrant status so the Service could annotate the Form I&hyph;94 with
its decision on the application. The rule proposed altering this process in certain cases to permit the filing of a
copy of the Form I&hyph;94. The notice of decision would serve as evidence of any decision and alteration to the terms
of the person's status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported this idea, suggesting it will eliminate problems with aliens not having evidence of
status while their application is pending, and that it will streamline filing. In fact, several asked why it was not
being extended to all such applications. However, several others opposed it, arguing that the change would create
yet another document employers would have to deal with, further confusing them as to who is authorized to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is moving to limit to two the number of INS documents employers are required to examine when a person applies
for employment: (a) Form I&hyph;551, Alien Registration Card, issued to permanent residents; and (b) Form I&hyph;688B,
Employment Authorization Document, also called an EAD, issued to persons who can accept employment in the open labor
market.

However, after determining that an alien is not otherwise authorized to work, an employer may file a petition to temporarily
employ him or her as a nonimmigrant. If the Service approves the petition, we notify the employer. If the alien is not
first required to be admitted in the status, and the Service's approval authorizes immediate employment, we include
this in the notice. The approval of such a petition does not authorize the alien to work elsewhere, but only for the employer
under the terms and conditions of the approved petition. An EAD is not necessary in such a context since the employer
has already determined the alien cannot work unless we approve its petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously when sending a notice that we had approved such a petition we also made a handwritten notation on the alien's
Form I&hyph;94. The computer system we are installing to improve service will allow us to replace such handwritten
notes with a computer generated notice that can be confirmed by the system. Therefore, the rulemaking proposed simplifying
filing requirements and allowing aliens to keep their existing Form I&hyph;94 as evidence of their status while their
new application is pending.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To eliminate any confusion, we are revising our approval notice to the employer to include a replacement Form I&hyph;94
that the employer can review and then give to the employee. In the interim the original Form I&hyph;94 must be filed
with the petition for annotation. The Service will publish a notice in the

Several commenters stated that applicants for asylum should be eligible for a refugee travel document. However,
an applicant for asylum is an applicant for a benefit, and does not acquire any status or travel authorization merely
as a result of having submitted the asylum application. It would be inappropriate to grant a travel document until
a decision is made that the person is eligible for asylum. If an asylum applicant chooses to leave the United States,
he or she may apply abroad for refugee status to reenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested clarification that a refugee travel document may be accepted in lieu of a passport as well as
a visa. The final rule clearly refers to the document as a travel document issued pursuant to article 28 of the United
Nations Convention of July 28, 1951 for the purpose of travel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service received many comments regarding advance parole. Although this subject needs to be addressed, the Service
has decided to defer this action to a separate rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters addressed the reentry permit provisions of the proposed rule. Most suggested that the proposed
provision precluding issuance to most aliens who have been abroad for more than 4 of the last 5 years since becoming
a permanent resident was too limiting, did not provide for exceptions, and did not recognize the needs of permanent
residents who are employed by multi-national companies on extended assignments abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was explained in the proposed rule, the Service's intent was to minimize the current broad review by the Government
of all the circumstances surrounding a person's absence, and instead focus on the simpler issue of how long he or she
has been gone. The language of the rule was written in such a way that a person is able to stay abroad for almost 6 years,
with only short trips back to the United States every 2 years, before he or she would become ineligible for a reentry
permit. This standard would have meant some people would not have received a permit, but, again, this ineligibility
in and of itself would not have jeopardized permanent resident status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe a clear standard is preferable to an abstract one in which the Government must look at the person's intent,
location of domiciles and assets, employment circumstances, and other circumstances of his or her life and make a
discretionary decision of whether to issue a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, upon further consideration, the Service recognizes that there may be those who will be unable to obtain a
travel document other than the reentry permit. Therefore, the rule will be modified so that rather than precluding
the issuance of the document, any such further issuance will be limited to a validity of one year. This simply means
that a person who remains abroad for more than the specified period will thereafter have to return annually to file
an application for a reentry permit instead of every 2 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, based on the comments received, the Service has revised the list of exceptions to the time limit rule to include
permanent residents defined in 8 CFR 211.1(b)(1)(i)(B), 211.1(b)(1)(ii) or 211.1(b)(4), as well as persons employed
by a public or national organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute, and their dependents.
The rule also exempts professional athletes who compete in the United States and worldwide.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the Service issue to any applicant for a replacement alien registration card an
interim work authorization document while it considers his or her application. However, this would encourage people
to file merely to get a document to enter the labor market. Under such circumstances, it would be inappropriate for
the Service to give a benefit before having an opportunity to determine if the person is actually eligible for it. Instead,
the Service is taking steps to accelerate the processing of this type of application in order to deliver a replacement
card more rapidly to those who are eligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters pointed to the situation of permanent residents in exclusion or deportation proceedings, and
suggested that the rule should clearly prohibit the confiscation of the permanent resident alien registration card
until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered. The rule has been clarified to indicate that such a person
is entitled to evidence of permanent resident status until a final order of deportation or exclusion is entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As requested by several commenters, the Service has modified the proposed rule to clearly allow for the concurrent
or subsequent filing of an application for further action on an application or petition, and to provide flexibility
to incorporate additional, similar processes by revising the form. The Service has also made minor editorial changes
in the rule for clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that to further streamline processing, the Service should require applicants to mail all
adjustment of status applications to the INS Service Centers, and eliminate the mandatory interview requirement.
The Service has since addressed this issue in a separate rulemaking, which was published in the

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation
merely sets forth evidentiary rules and processes by which persons may apply for and receive certain immigration
benefits and does not alter substantive requirements. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning
of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.

An application or petition received in a Service office shall be stamped to show the time and date of actual receipt
and, unless otherwise specified in part 204 or part 245 of this chapter, shall be regarded as filed when so stamped,
if it is properly signed and executed and the required fee is attached or a fee waiver is granted. An application which
is not properly signed or is submitted with the wrong fee shall be rejected as improperly filed. Rejected applications,
and ones in which the check or other financial instrument is returned as not payable, will not retain a filing date.
An application or petition taken to a local Service office for the completion of biometric information prior to filing

 If a check or other financial instrument used to pay a filing fee is subsequently returned as not payable, the remitter
shall be notified and requested to immediately pay the filing fee and associated service charge within 14 days, without
extension. If the application or petition is pending and these charges are not paid, it shall be rejected as improperly
filed. If it was already approved, and these charges are not paid, it shall be automatically revoked because it was
improperly filed. If it was already denied, revoked, or abandoned, that decision will not be affected by the non-payment
of the filing fee. A new fee will be required with any new application or petition. Any fee and service charges collected
as the result of collection activities or legal action on the prior application or petition shall be used to cover the
cost of the previous rejection, revocation, or other action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The non-existence or other unavailability of required evidence creates a presumption of ineligibility. If a required
document, such as a birth or marriage certificate, does not exist or cannot be obtained, an applicant or petitioner
must demonstrate this and submit secondary evidence, such as church or school records, pertinent to the facts at issue.
If secondary evidence also does not exist or cannot be obtained, the applicant or petitioner must demonstrate the
unavailability of both the required document and relevant secondary evidence, and submit two or more affidavits,
sworn to or affirmed by persons who are not parties to the petition who have direct personal knowledge of the event and
circumstances. Secondary evidence must overcome the unavailability of primary evidence, and affidavits must overcome
the unavailability of both primary and secondary evidence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where a record does not exist, the applicant or petitioner must submit an original written statement on government
letterhead establishing this from the relevant government or other authority. The statement must indicate the reason
the record does not exist, and indicate whether similar records for the time and place are available. However, a certification
from an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's
Foreign Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An applicant or petitioner who has
not been able to acquire the necessary document or statement from the relevant foreign authority may submit evidence
that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain the required document or statement. However, where the Service
finds that such documents or statements are generally available, it may require that the applicant or petitioner
submit the required document or statement.

and other statements, must be submitted in the original unless previously filed with the Service. When submission
is required, expired Service documents must be submitted in the original, as must Service documents required to be
annotated to indicate the decision. In all other instances, unless the relevant regulations or instructions specifically
require that an original document be filed with an application or petition, an ordinary legible photocopy may be submitted.
Original documents submitted when not required will remain a part of the record, even if the submission was not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where a copy of a document is submitted with an application or petition, the Service may at any time require that the
original document be submitted for review. If the requested original, other than one issued by the Service, is not
submitted within 12 weeks, the petition or application shall be denied or revoked. There shall be no appeal from a denial
or revocation based on the failure to submit an original document upon the request of the Service to substantiate a
previously submitted copy. Further, an applicant or petitioner may not move to reopen or reconsider the proceeding
based on the subsequent availability of the document. An original document submitted pursuant to a Service request
shall be returned to the petitioner or applicant when no longer required.

Withdrawal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant or petitioner may withdraw an application or petition at any time until a decision is issued by the Service
or, in the case of an approved petition, until the person is admitted or granted adjustment or change of status, based
on the petition. However, a withdrawal may not be retracted.

Testimony. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service may require the taking of testimony, and may direct any necessary investigation. When a statement is taken
from and signed by a person, he or she shall, upon request, be given a copy without fee. Any allegations made subsequent
to filing an application or petition which are in addition to, or in substitution for, those originally made, shall
be filed in the same manner as the original application, petition, or document, and acknowledged under oath thereon.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Request for evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If there is evidence of ineligibility in the record, an application or petition shall be denied on that basis notwithstanding
any lack of required initial evidence. If the application or petition was pre-screened by the Service prior to filing
and was filed even though the applicant or petitioner was informed that the required initial evidence was missing,
the application or petition shall be denied for failure to contain the necessary evidence. Except as otherwise provided
in this chapter, in other instances where there is no evidence of ineligibility, and initial evidence or eligibility
information is missing or the Service finds that the evidence submitted either does not fully establish eligibility
for the requested benefit or raises underlying questions regarding eligibility, the Service shall request the missing
initial evidence, and may request additional evidence, including blood tests. In such cases, the applicant or petitioner
shall be given 12 weeks to respond to a request for evidence. Additional time may not be granted. Within this period
the applicant or petitioner may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Submit all the requested initial or additional evidence;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Submit some or none of the requested additional evidence and ask for a decision based on the record; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Withdraw the application or petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Request for appearance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant, a petitioner, and/or a beneficiary may be required to appear for an interview. A petitioner shall also
be notified when an interview notice is mailed or issued to a beneficiary. The person may appear as requested by the
Service or, prior to the date and time of the interview: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The person to be interviewed may, for good cause, request that the interview be rescheduled; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The applicant or petitioner may withdraw the application or petition.

Effect on processing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority date of a properly filed petition shall not be affected by a request for missing initial evidence or request
for other evidence. If an application or petition is missing required initial evidence, or an applicant, petitioner,
or beneficiary requests that an interview be rescheduled, any time period imposed on Service processing will start
over from the date of receipt of the required initial evidence or request for interview rescheduling. If the Service
requests that the applicant or petitioner submit additional evidence or respond to other than a request for initial
evidence, any time limitation imposed on the Service for processing will be suspended as of the date of the request.
It will resume at the same point where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or response, or a
request for a decision based on the evidence submitted.

Effect on interim benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interim benefits will not be granted based on an application or petition held in suspense for the submission of requested
initial evidence, except that the applicant or beneficiary will normally be allowed to remain while an application
or petition to extend or obtain status while in the United States is pending. The Service may choose to pursue other
actions to seek removal of a person notwithstanding the pending application. Employment authorization previously
accorded based on the same status and employment as that requested in the current application or petition may continue
uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20) during the suspense period.

Effect where evidence submitted in response to a request does not establish eligibility at the time of filing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application or petition shall be denied where evidence submitted in response to a request for initial evidence
does not establish filing eligibility at the time the application or petition was filed. An application or petition
shall be denied where any application or petition upon which it was based was filed subsequently.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If all requested initial evidence and requested additional evidence is not submitted by the required date, the application
or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied. Except as provided in &sect;335.6 of
this chapter, if a person requested to appear for an interview does not appear, the Service does not receive his or her
request for rescheduling by the date of the interview, or the applicant or petitioner has not withdrawn the application
or petition, the application or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of request for decision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an applicant or petitioner does not submit all requested additional evidence and requests a decision based on
the evidence already submitted, a decision shall be issued based on the record. Failure to submit requested evidence
which precludes a material line of inquiry shall be grounds for denying the application or petition. Failure to appear
for a required interview, or to give required testimony, shall result in the denial of any related application or petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of withdrawal or denial due to abandonment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service's acknowledgement of a withdrawal may not be appealed. A denial due to abandonment may not be appealed,
but an applicant or petitioner may file a motion to reopen under &sect;103.5. Withdrawal or denial due to abandonment
does not preclude the filing of a new application or petition with a new fee. However, the priority or processing date
of a withdrawn or abandoned application or petition may not be applied to a later application petition. Withdrawal
or denial due to abandonment shall not itself affect the new proceeding; but the facts and circumstances surrounding
the prior application or petition shall otherwise be material to the new application or petition.

Verifying claimed permanent resident status. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The status of an applicant or petitioner who claims that he or she is a permanent resident of the United States will be
verified from official records of the Service. The term official records, as used herein, includes Service files,
arrival manifests, arrival records, Service index cards, Immigrant Identification Cards, Certificates of Registry,
Declarations of Intention issued after July 1, 1929, Alien Registration Receipt Cards Forms AR&hyph;3, AR&hyph;103,
I&hyph;151 or I&hyph;551), passports, and reentry permits. To constitute an official record a Service index card
must bear a designated immigrant visa symbol and must have been prepared by an authorized official of the Service in
the course of processing immigrant admissions or adjustments to permanent resident status. Other cards, certificates,
declarations, permits, and passports must have been issued or endorsed by the Service to show admission for permanent
residence. Except as otherwise provided in 8 CFR part 101, and in the absence of countervailing evidence, such official
records shall be regarded as establishing lawful admission for permanent residence.

Requirements for motion to reopen. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be provided in the reopened proceeding and be supported by affidavits
or other documentary evidence. A motion to reopen an application or petition denied due to abandonment must be filed
with evidence that the decision was in error because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The requested evidence was not material to the issue of eligibility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The required initial evidence was submitted with the application or petition, or the request for initial evidence
or additional information or appearance was complied with during the allotted period; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The request for additional information or appearance was sent to an address other than that on the application,
petition, or notice of representation, or that the applicant or petitioner advised the Service, in writing, of a change
of address or change of representation subsequent to filing and before the Service's request was sent, and the request
did not go to the new address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for motion to reconsider. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions
to establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or Service policy. A motion to reconsider
a decision on an application or petition must, when filed, also establish that the decision was incorrect based on
the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations to permit district directors,
acting alone, to waive a nonimmigrant visa or passport under section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act in individual cases, if satisfied that a nonimmigrant alien is unable to present these documents because of an
unforeseen emergency. Formerly, in such circumstances the district director was required to seek concurrence of
the Department of State Visa Office to grant a waiver of the nonimmigrant visa or passport. In eliminating the step
of seeking concurrence on each waiver, this amendment will save resources for both agencies and reduce the time it
takes to admit certain nonimmigrant aliens.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of State and the Attorney General,
acting jointly, to waive a nonimmigrant alien's visa or passport when an alien is unable to present the required documents
due to an unforeseen emergency. Previously, when such a nonimmigrant appeared at a port of entry, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service district director was required to seek the concurrence of the Department of State Visa
Office prior to granting the waiver. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the Commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service by title 8 U.S.C. section 103 and to the Director of the Visa Office of the Department of State
by title 8 U.S.C. section 104, the Commissioner and the Director of the Visa Office, acting jointly, determined that
the previous procedure was unnecessarily burdensome. Officers of the Department of State concurred with the recommendations
from the ports of entry in over 95% of the cases presented. Having the district director exercise the function of the
Department of State Visa Office simultaneously with the function assigned to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service will save resources for both agencies and result in a quicker admission of the alien. If the district director
is satisfied that the alien failed to present a passport or a visa because of an unforeseen emergency and that the alien
should be granted the waiver, then the procedure at the ports of entry will remain the same. The alien will fill out an
application for the waiver, the information will be checked, and a fee will be charged. The Department of State is promulgating
a similar regulation that amends &sect;41.2 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (The Service) published a proposed rule, with a request for comments,
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 30, 1991, at 56 FR 36028, amending 8 CFR 212.1(g). The comment period ended on August 29, 1991. The Service received
three comments. One commentor endorsed the rule's practicality but recommended a change in language in the phrase
``unable to obtain the required documents'' so that it reads ``unable to present the required documents''. The Service
agrees that the change improves the rule by allowing waivers to be granted in cases where the alien possesses the required
documents but cannot produce them at the port of entry. This change is incorporated in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentor expressed concern that language in the proposed regulation might mislead a reader to think that
the Service will seek concurrence from the Visa Office without first determining that the alien is entitled to a waiver
of documents. Such a procedure would be a deviation from the Service's past practice rather than a continuation of
it, as the Service intends, except for eliminating the step of seeking concurrence from the Department of State Visa
Office. Language in the final rule has been changed to clarify this point.

Another commentor noted that transportation companies cannot board an alien passenger traveling in emergency circumstances
who lacks the required documents without incurring a fine at the port of entry. The commentor recommended adding a
provision to the rule which would specify the steps a carrier must take to board such a passenger without incurring
a fine. This rule is not intended to expand the circumstances under which an alien may apply for a waiver of documents,
only to simplify the administrative procedure for granting a waiver, and therefore the recommendation will not be
incorporated into the final rule.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
merely reflects an agreement reached between the Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service
that results in a less burdensome administrative procedure. In addition, members of the public are serviced in a more
expeditious manner as a result of the effect of this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, November 29, 1990, dramatically altered the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant classification. IMMACT, among other things, removed prominent aliens from the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
classification and required prospective employers to obtain an approved labor condition application from the Department
of Labor prior to the admission of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to concerns raised by a number of interested parties, Congress incorporated numerous provisions in the
Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;232, December
12, 1991, which amended some of the provisions created by IMMACT. Specifically, Public Law 102&hyph;232 amended
the definition of an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant alien by removing the requirement that the intending employer obtain
an approved labor condition application prior to the alien's admission into the United States, amended the criteria
which the Secretary of Labor could use in invoking the penalty provisions relating to misrepresentations and omissions
on the labor condition application, and, lastly, addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States
to perform services in the medical profession.

Prior to the passage of Public Law 102&hyph;232, petitioners in H&hyph;1B cases were required to submit a copy of an
approved labor condition application with the petition. Public Law 102&hyph;232 amended this language by requiring
only that petitioners attach a certification from the Secretary of Labor indicating that the petitioner has filed
a labor condition application with the Secretary of Labor. The interim rule contained language reflecting this amendment
to the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that a petitioner could meet this statutory requirement by merely submitting a copy of the
labor condition application without waiting for the Department of Labor to certify the labor condition application.
However, submitting a copy of the labor condition application is not sufficient to show that the application has been
filed. Only when the application has been certified can the Service be assured that the petitioner has complied with
the filing requirement. Therefore, the Service did not adopt this recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that IMMACT imposed a number of penalties on employers who failed to meet certain conditions of
the labor condition application process. Section 212(n)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act states that in those situations the
Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed by the offending employer under section 204 or 214(c) of the Act
for a period of one year. The commenter noted that &sect;214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the interim regulation indicated only that the Attorney General shall not approve petitions under the H&hyph;1B
category. In response to this comment the final rule will be amended to indicate that this provision applies to petitions
filed under both sections 204 and 214(c) of the Act as required by statute.

One commenter suggested that petitioners in H&hyph;1B and H&hyph;2B cases should be required to post a bond in order
to prove to the Service that the return transportation requirement will be met. It is the opinion of the Service that
the statute and regulations clearly state the requirement that a petitioner in these instances is responsible for
the alien beneficiary's return transportation. The filing of the petition is sufficient assurance to the Service
that the petitioner will comply with this requirement.

Prior to the passage of IMMACT, alien graduates of foreign medical schools were excluded from classification as H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants unless they were coming to the United States pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private
educational or research institution or agency to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for such institution or
agency. These physicians were not authorized to perform direct patient care unless it was incidental to the teaching
or research. This restriction, however, was not contained in IMMACT, thereby allowing graduates of foreign medical
schools to perform direct patient care in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;232 addressed the issue of foreign physicians coming to the United States to perform services
in the medical profession. The legislation provided that these aliens could obtain H&hyph;1B classification in
either of two ways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First (mirroring the pre-IMMACT statutory language), an alien may be accorded H&hyph;1B classification if the alien
is coming to the United States pursuant to an invitation from a public or nonprofit private educational or research
institution or agency to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for such institution or agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, an alien may be accorded H&hyph;1B classification if he or she has passed the Federation Licensing Examination
(FLEX) or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Eligibility under
this criterion also requires a demonstration that the alien has competency in oral and written English or that the
alien has graduated from a school of medicine accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary
of Education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the interim rule, it was stated that there was no distinction between alien physicians educated
in the United States and those educated abroad and that both had to pass the Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX)
in order to be classified as an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant in order to perform direct patient care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters stated that the FLEX requirement should not be applicable to alien graduates of United States medical
schools since, over the previous decade, the Service has consistently permitted these aliens to engage in direct
patient care under the H&hyph;1B classification. These commenters also noted that graduates of United States medical
schools are not normally required to take the FLEX examination as part of their training and licensing requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the interim rule, the Service altered its position on this issue, reaffirming that
the FLEX requirement did not apply to aliens educated at United States medical schools. This position now will be codified
in the final rule. It should be noted, however, that the FLEX requirement does apply to aliens educated in foreign medical
schools, including schools in Canada. The final rule will be amended to reflect the Service's present position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters noted that aliens of national or international renown in the field of medicine, pursuant to section
101(a)(41) of the Act, are not considered graduates of a medical school and should be exempt for the FLEX requirement.
The Service agrees with this comment and the final rule will be amended to indicate that aliens of national or international
renown in the field of medicine are exempt from the FLEX requirement as well as the other requirements set forth in section
212(j)(2) of the Act. They are, however, required to meet the licensure requirements for the state of intended employment.

Equivalency to the FLEX 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;232 provides that alien physicians who wish to perform patient care in the United States must,
among other things, pass the FLEX examination or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services. By notice published on September 16, 1992 at 57 FR 42755, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
designated Parts I, II, and III of the National Board of Medical Examiners certifying examinations and the Steps 1,
2, and 3 examinations of the United States Medical Licensing Examinations program as equivalent to the FLEX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six commenters suggested that the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC), the Canadian medical licensing
procedure, or a State license should also be determined to be equivalent to the FLEX. A determination that the LMCC
or a state license is equivalent to the FLEX is outside the scope of the Service's authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

Competency in the English Language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;232 also requires that graduates of medical schools coming to the United States to perform services
in the medical professions must demonstrate competency in oral and written English or be a graduate of a school of medicine
accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Education. The interim rule contains the
requirement that a petitioner may demonstrate English competency by submitting evidence that the alien has passed
the English test given by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). The interim regulation
did not contain any additional tests or mechanisms to establish competency in the English language but it was stated
in the preamble to the interim rule that the Service would consider other suggestions to demonstrate competency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) should be recognized as an alternate
test to establish English competency. Since the results of the TOEFL are reported as a raw score which must be interpreted
by the entity reviewing the score, and the administrators of the test have not established a passing grade for the test,
the Service cannot adopt this suggestion since it does not have the expertise or resources to interpret this test.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters also suggested that the Service recognize that graduates of medical schools located in an English-speaking
country in which the language of instruction is also English have competency in the English language. Since the statutory
language already addresses the issue of language competency in relation to graduation from certain universities,
the adoption of this suggestion would be in conflict with the statutory language.

Licensure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule requires that a petition for a physician coming to the United States to perform services in the medical
profession must be accompanied by evidence that the physician has a license or authorization required by the State
of intended employment, if the state requires such license or authorization. This language was adopted to ensure
that at the time the petition was filed the physician and met the regulatory requirements relating to the practice
of medicine in the state of intended employment. The regulation also recognizes that, in certain instances, a state
may not require a physician to obtain an actual medical license in order to perform the duties of a particular position.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that the regulations of the state of intended employment should dictate which type of license,
if any, should be required by the Service. This suggested regulatory change is unnecessary since it is already provided
for in the language of the interim rule at &sect;214.2(h)(4)(viii)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter also noted that certain physicians employer by the United States government, such as the Veterans Administration,
are not required to possess a license issued by the state of intended employment hut merely require a license from any
state. The final rule has been amended to accommodate this situation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that an alien physician should not be required to obtain a medical license if the alien is not
coming to the United States to perform patient care. As written, the interim rule requires that licensure must be obtained
only in those situations where the alien beneficiary will be performing clinical care. An alien physician coming
to fill a position which does not normally require licensure, e.g., medical research, would not be required to obtain
a license. Thus, this suggestion need not be adopted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial approval of an H&hyph;1B petition is currently limited to three years. One commenter suggested that H&hyph;1B
petitions should be approved for the validity period of the supporting labor condition application, not to exceed
six years. The Service does not deem it appropriate to consider extending the initial validity period of H&hyph;1B
petitions without first soliciting public comment on the issue. This issue will be addressed in a future proposed
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
merely clarifies provisions of the MTINA which establish certain new petitioning procedures for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
and new eligibility criteria for foreign physicians seeking employment in the medical profession in this country,
and therefore has a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 economic impact on small entities. This rule is not considered to be significant within section 3(f) of E.O. 12866,
nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance
with E.O. 12612.

This rule amends the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) relating to applications
for lawful temporary residence under section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, this rule
amends the special rule for determination of public charge to provide that aliens who are self-supporting despite
earning income below the poverty level may be admissible without having to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under
8 CFR 245a.2(k) (2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 45235&hyph;45236, an interim rule with request for comments to amend 8 CFR part 245a. The interim rule was issued

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19
``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes. This action requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to limit
altitude and airspeed operations of the airplane under certain conditions of hydraulic system failure. This amendment
is prompted by a report of sheared-off shear pins found on one airplane's elevator dampers. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent undampened vibration of the elevators in normal cruise conditions when combined
with hydraulic system failures, a condition which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 ``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes. Transport
Canada Aviation advises that one operator of these airplanes found that the shear pins on the airplane elevator dampers
had sheared off. This finding was made during a routine check of the airplane. The cause of the pin failure has not been
determined. Failure of the shear pins on the elevator damper, if not detected and corrected, may lead to undampened
vibration of the elevators during normal cruise conditions when combined with hydraulic system failures. This situation
could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada, Transport Canada Aviation issued a Canadian
airworthiness directive on December 17, 1993, that restricts operation of these airplanes to certain altitude and
airspeed limits under various conditions of hydraulic system failure. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport
Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of
this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent undampened vibration of the elevators during
normal cruise conditions in the event of hydraulic system failures, which could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM) to restrict altitude and airspeed operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider additional
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;230&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

On September 10, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that alters VOR Federal Airway
V&hyph;220, located in Colorado and Nebraska, to coincide with the scheduled opening date of the new Denver International
Airport (58 FR 47631). This action is necessary to incorporate a recent amendment to V&hyph;220 between Grand Junction,
CO, and Meeker, CO, which became effective on November 11, 1993 (58 FR 51010).

 This final rule authorizes the District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to exercise the Department
of State's function with respect to the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement under the provisions of section
212(d)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The rule eliminates time consuming procedures for obtaining
the concurrence of passport and/or visa waivers, and benefits certain nonimmigrant aliens who, because of unforeseen
circumstances, are subjected to delays when seeking admission to the United States without the required documents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 30, 1991, the Department of State published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 36029. The rule proposed
to amend part 41, &sect;41.2(j), which provided for the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement by the District
Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at the port of entry, with the concurrence of the designated
State Department official, if such officials were satisfied that the nonimmigrant alien was unable to obtain the
required documentation because of an unforeseen emergency. This final rule authorizes the District Director of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the port of entry to exercise the Department of State's function with
respect to the waiver of the passport and/or visa requirement under the provisions of INA 212(d)(4)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period the Department received only one comment. The commenting organization noted that under
the proposed regulations nonimmigrants who are ``unable to obtain'' the required documents may benefit from such
a waiver. The commenter suggested that the proposed language be amended to read ``unable to present'' the required
documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the historical files reveals that the language in question has been in use since at least 1958. The focus
at that time was on fact patterns in which the alien indeed could not for geographical, political, and other reasons
obtain the required documents. Circumstances have changed radically since that time. The Department believes that
the recommendation to change the word ``obtain'' to read ``present'' has merit as it more accurately reflects current
world circumstances and the intent of the statute. In order to gain admission to the United States an alien must present
the required pertinent documentation, whether one has the ability or not to obtain such. Absent such documentation,
the immigration officer in charge at the port of entry must decide whether the applicant for admission is indeed qualified
for the desired nonimmigrant visa classification and whether the inability to present the required documentation
was due to an unforeseen emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Department wishes to clarify the limited extent of the authority delegated to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Although the proposed rule permits the District Director to waive the documentary requirements
of INA 212(a)(7)(B), the Department of State will continue to exercise the authority vested in the Secretary of State
and the Attorney General under the provisions of INA 212(d)(4)(A) relating to the joint concurrence in documentary
waivers, except in the circumstances described in &sect;41.2(j) of this final rule. Consequently, this final rule
makes minor modifications to the text of the regulation as discussed in the preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291 nor is it expected to have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition,
this rule does not impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980. This rule has been revised as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith.

port of entry concludes that the alien is unable to present the required documents because of an unforeseen emergency.
Any waiver of the visa or passport requirement may be granted by the INS district director pursuant to INA 212(d)(4)(A)
without the prior concurrence of the Department of State in each case in which the district director concludes that
the alien's claim of emergency circumstances is legitimate and bona fide and that approval of the waiver would be appropriate
under all of the attendant facts and circumstances.

 This rule revises currently applicable multifamily and health facility coinsurance regulations to eliminate the
requirement that the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer
responsibility on current coinsured mortgages held by a defaulting lender-issuer before requesting full insurance
endorsement by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The purpose of the rule is to eliminate a current regulatory
requirement which has proved to be time-consuming and, in most cases, unnecessary.

 The Department's former regulations concerning GNMA's right to assignment of coinsured mortgages were found at
24 CFR 251.827 (Multifamily Coinsurance_New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation), &sect;252.827 (Coinsurance
of Nursing Homes and Related Facilities), and &sect;255.827 (Coinsurance of Mortgages Covering Existing Multifamily
Projects), before their recent removal as part of the termination of the Coinsurance program sections on right to
assignment provided that, for any Coinsured Mortgage that is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer,
GNMA will first attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another eligible coinsuring lender by soliciting offers
to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring
lenders that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the Commissioner and that are also
GNMA issuers. If GNMA rejects all offers or no offers are received, GNMA will then have the right to perfect an assignment
of the Mortgage to itself. The Commissioner will endorse any Mortgage assigned to GNMA as provided by this section
for full insurance effective as of the date of assignment in accordance with the appropriate provisions of title 24
of the Code of Federal Regulations.

On October 10, 1990, a final rule was published (55 FR 41312) terminating the FHA multifamily coinsurance programs
and revising parts 251, 252 and 255. As a result of the final rule, parts 251, 252 and 255 each now consist of a single section
dealing with the program phase-out process. However, while the former rule's provisions are no longer included in
the Code of Federal Regulations, those regulations in effect before November 12, 1990 continue to govern the rights
and obligations of mortgagors, coinsuring lenders and HUD in existence before the termination of the coinsurance
programs. The effect of this rule is to revise those regulations as they relate to the handling of mortgage assignments
to GNMA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 15, 1992 the Department published a proposed rule (57 FR 59314) identical in text to this final rule. No
comments were received from the public concerning this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In lieu of the above-quoted paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), this rule provides that ``For any Coinsured Mortgage that
is not in default and is held by a defaulting lender-issuer, GNMA will have the right to perfect an assignment of the
mortgage to itself. However, before exercising this right, GNMA will attempt to have the Mortgage assigned to another
eligible coinsuring lender (unless it determines, with the agreement of the Commissioner, that the attempt would
prove ineffectual because of market or other conditions). The assignment will be attempted by soliciting offers
to assume the defaulting lender-issuer's rights and obligations under the Mortgage from those eligible coinsuring
lenders that are also GNMA issuers and that are indicated on a periodically updated listing furnished to GNMA by the
Commissioner.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the facts that (a) the authority to coinsure mortgages has been terminated; (b) for the most part, no market exists
for the purchase of coinsurance servicing rights; and (c) none of the few remaining approved coinsuring lenders has
shown any interest to date in assuming additional coinsuring risk by assignment of loans from GNMA, implementation
of the regulatory requirement earlier set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) has proved to be a time-consuming,
burdensome and fruitless process. Therefore, this rule amends parts 251, 252 and 255 to eliminate the requirement
that GNMA, in every case, first attempt to assign issuer-servicer responsibility on current coinsured mortgages
before perfecting assignment of the Coinsured Mortgage to itself and requesting full insurance endorsement by FHA.

This final rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget as a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993.
Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are a part of the public docket file in the office of the Rules Docket
Clerk listed at the beginning of this preamble.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is procedural
in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was listed as item number 1540 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October
25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56431) under Executive order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule do not have Federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under
the Order. No programmatic or policy changes result from this rule's promulgation which would affect existing relationships
between the Federal Government and State and local governments.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is procedural in nature and no significant change in existing
HUD policies or programs impacting on the family result from promulgation of this rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking sets forth criteria that EPA must consider when exercising its discretionary authority to impose
sanctions on a statewide basis pursuant to the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act). If EPA makes one of the findings
of State implementation plan (SIP) deficiency described in the Act, EPA may impose an emissions offset or highway
funding sanction on any portion of the State that the Administrator determines is reasonable and appropriate for
the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of the Act relating to plans are met. This rulemaking establishes the
criteria EPA shall use in exercising its discretionary authority during the 24-month period following a finding
of a plan deficiency to ensure that these sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis when one or more political subdivisions
are principally responsible for such deficiency. In addition, EPA describes the discretionary sanctions provision
and EPA's anticipated application of these sanctions ``at any time'' after the Agency makes a finding.

I. Overview

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is promulgating criteria under section 110(m) of the Act to ensure that, during the 24-month period following
a finding, disapproval, or determination (hereinafter ``finding'') referred to in section 179(a), sanctions pursuant
to section 110(m) are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible
for such deficiency. Thus, these criteria apply only in the limited circumstance in which EPA is considering the imposition
of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) within 24 months after the Agency makes a section 179(a) finding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 28, 1992 (57 FR 44534), EPA proposed criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant
to section 110(m) of the Act may not be applied statewide. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion
of the background of the Act, of the proposed criteria, and of the provisions of section 179 and section 110(m) (see
57 FR 44534&hyph;44535). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;52.30(c) of the rule provides five criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant
to section 110(m) may not be imposed statewide. If at least one political subdivision meets all five of the criteria,
then that political subdivision will be considered principally responsible, and EPA will not impose sanctions on
a statewide basis. Rather, EPA will impose sanctions only on the areas of the State for which EPA determines it is reasonable
and appropriate to impose sanctions. If all of the criteria are not met by at least one political subdivision, then
no political subdivision is principally responsible, and EPA will use its discretion to determine whether to apply
statewide sanctions. However, if EPA, using its discretion, initially determines that less-than-statewide sanctions
should be applied, the Agency will not need to consider the criteria; EPA will impose sanctions on those political
subdivisions the Agency has determined to be reasonable and appropriate. Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case
basis and each action will be subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure
Act.

As noted in EPA's proposed rule, the Agency will follow notice-and-comment rulemaking in every instance that EPA
anticipates imposing section 110(m) sanctions (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). In each rulemaking action, the
public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed geographic scope of the sanctions, the timing of the sanctions,
and the order in which the two available sanctions will be imposed. To the extent the public has commented on these issues
as a general matter in this rulemaking action, EPA has responded by suggesting that the issue is more appropriately
raised in independent rulemaking actions in which section 110(m) sanctions are proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule, EPA has changed four provisions from the proposal based on comments received regarding specific
details of the regulatory text. They are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In &sect;52.30(a)(2), the definition of ``required activity'' was revised in two ways. First, the phrase ``may
include, but is not limited to'' was deleted from the definition. Second, the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element''
is replaced by the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' These two changes were made in order to follow more clearly the language
of section 110(m). Since section 110(m) refers only to actions required with respect to a ``plan or plan item,'' EPA
agrees that the phrase ``may include, but is not limited to'' is unnecessary because it appears to imply EPA has authority
to impose sanctions with respect to findings other than those for a plan or plan item. Furthermore, since section 110(m)
uses the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' EPA believes it would be more consistent to use that phrase in the regulatory
language rather than the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The terms ``plan or plan items'' are added to the definitions section of the rule, &sect;52.30(a)(4), and are defined
as follows: ``For purposes of &sect;52.30, the terms `plan' or `plan item' mean an implementation plan or portion
of an implementation plan or action needed to prepare such plan required by the Act, as amended in 1990, or in response
to a SIP Call under section 110(k)(5) of the amended Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In &sect;52.30(c), ``criteria,'' as defined in the proposal, provides: ``The EPA will use the following five criteria,
all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.''
This section is clarified by revising it to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this provision, EPA will consider
a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based,
if all five of the following criteria are met.'' Thus, the rule clarifies that all five criteria are to be met, not merely
used by EPA to determine how sanctions will be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In its proposed rule, &sect;52.30(d)(1), EPA provides: ``If all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section
have been met through the action or inaction of the `same' political subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on
a statewide basis.'' Although no comments were received from the public on this language, a review by the Agency suggested
that the phrase ``same political subdivision'' may be confusing. By including that language in the rule, EPA was attempting
to indicate that one political subdivision must meet all five of the criteria before EPA's authority to impose sanctions
on a statewide basis would be constrained (see 57 FR 44536). For example, if a State has two nonattainment areas and
a rule, which was past due under the Act, was not yet adopted and submitted to EPA for either area, EPA would look at each
nonattainment area independently to determine whether the five criteria were met. If the first three criteria were
met by one nonattainment area and the last two by the second nonattainment area, then EPA's authority to impose statewide
sanctions would not be constrained. However, if one nonattainment area met all five of the criteria, EPA could not
impose statewide sanctions based on the finding for that area. The EPA is replacing the word same with the word one in
the rule in order to alleviate any confusion. This provision will be implemented in accordance with the interpretation
above.

It is necessary, for clarity's sake, to understand that section 179(a) performs two very distinct functions: it defines
several types of findings, and requires EPA to impose sanctions if one of these findings has been made. Section 179(a)
(1) through (4) sets forth the four types of findings which may lead to the imposition of a sanction. The introduction
and latter part of section 179(a) mandate that at least one sanction must be imposed 18 months after a finding has been
made with respect to certain types of plans if the deficiency is not corrected.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking considers the application of sanctions under section 110(m). However, because section 110(m) and
section 179 are interrelated, the preamble to the proposed rulemaking discussed sanctions under section 179 (a)
and (b) in order to clarify what is required by section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific types of sanctions which may be imposed under section 110(m), or must be imposed under section 179(a),
are listed in section 179(b). The two sanctions provided are a highway funding sanction and a 2:1 offset sanction.
These two sanctions are described in more detail in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(b) sanctions may be applied pursuant to section 110(m) when the Administrator makes a finding under section
179(a) (1) through (4), provided that the Agency has followed all procedural requirements for imposing a sanction.
The Administrator has no authority under section 110(m), nor any mandatory duty under section 179(a), to impose sanctions
until she has made a finding. The types of findings provided under section 179(a) are discussed in more detail in the
preamble to the proposed rule (see 57 FR 44535). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(m) may be divided into two distinct parts (see 57 FR 44535). The first part of section 110(m) contains four
distinct elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The timing of the imposition of section 110(m) sanctions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The availability under section 110(m) of the sanctions listed in section 179(b); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The reference to a finding, disapproval, or determination under section 179(a) (1) through (4); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The geographic scope of application of sanctions under section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The second part requires the Administrator to propose criteria to be used when considering the application of sanctions
on a statewide basis under section 110(m) within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. Although not central to the
purpose of this rulemaking, EPA presented a detailed discussion of the four elements referred to in the first part
of section 110(m) in the proposed rule. The purpose was to explain how sections 110(m) and 179 provisions are interrelated.
As shall be evident in the ``Response to Comments'' section, the preamble language discussing these four elements
was the basis for numerous comments. The criteria, which are the basis of this action, seemed to generate significantly
fewer comments.

III. Development of Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second sentence of section 110(m) requires the Agency to establish criteria that EPA must apply if the Agency considers
applying sanctions under section 110(m) on a statewide basis within 24 months of a section 179(a) finding. These criteria
should enable EPA to determine when a political subdivision,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than the entire State, is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency. Where the political subdivision
is principally responsible, EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;52.30(a)(1), EPA defines the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
political subdivision
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 as ``*&blank;*&blank;* the representative body that is responsible for adopting and/or implementing air pollution
controls for one, or any combination of one or more of the following: city, town, borough, county, parish, district,
or any other geographical subdivision created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law. This will include any agency
designated under section 174, 42 U.S.C., section 7504, by the State to carry out the air planning responsibilities
under part D.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA recognizes that an understanding of the term ``principal responsibility'' was integral to the development
of the criteria. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion on how a political subdivision may
be held ``principally responsible'' for a section 179(a) failure when the EPA recognizes that the States have primary
responsibility for meeting the requirements of the Act (see 57 FR 44535&hyph;36). The EPA believes that the criteria
promulgated today will clearly indicate when the political subdivision carries the principal burden of carrying
out an activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is promulgating five criteria (summarized below) that it believes will enable a determination of when a State
has relinquished its primary control over an activity to a political subdivision and the political subdivision has
failed to perform that required activity. The EPA believes that the political subdivision is principally responsible
when the political subdivision: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Has the legal authority to perform the required activity;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If one or more political subdivisions each meet all five of the criteria, EPA will consider those subdivisions principally
responsible, and EPA may impose sanctions only on those political subdivisions and on other areas (short of the entire
State) for which the Agency determines reasonable and appropriate. The EPA would not impose sanctions statewide.
However, if all of the criteria have not been met by at least one political subdivision, EPA will use its discretion
to determine whether to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These five criteria are intended to be applicable to SIP failures relating to stationary, area, and mobile sources.
The EPA believes that the criteria developed here will enable it to successfully determine when a political subdivision
is principally responsible for a deficiency.

IV. Limits of This Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in the Act precludes EPA from applying sanctions pursuant to section 110(m), without examining the criteria,
if the Agency elects to impose a sanction on a less-than-statewide basis or where EPA imposes statewide sanctions
more than 24 months after a finding. Furthermore, this rulemaking does not affect the situation where each of a group
of political subdivisions, whose combined area comprises the entire State, suffer a deficiency. The EPA could impose
a sanction on each of those political subdivisions as an independent area without applying the criteria, even though
this may appear to be a statewide sanction. All decisions to impose section 110(m) sanctions will be made on a case-by-case
basis, and will be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not intended to identify which sanction EPA will apply in a particular circumstance, nor the type of deficiency
for which EPA might use its discretion to apply sanctions. Furthermore, it is not intended to describe the notice and
comment procedures EPA will ultimately use to impose a sanction pursuant to section 110(m).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this category, the commenters expressed concern with respect to the timing of sanctions and the application

being promulgated, EPA has responded to these comments below.

1. Imposition of Sanctions Earlier Than 18 Months

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Illinois EPA (IEPA) and the Virginia Department of Transportation (DOT) believe section 110(m) does not give
EPA the authority to impose sanctions earlier than 18 months after a finding under section 179. These commenters believe
it is incorrect to impose any sanctions during the 18-month period immediately following a finding because section
179 clearly states that EPA may not impose sanctions if the deficiency is corrected within 18 months. The IEPA believes
Congress included this 18-month period in recognition of the magnitude of the State's responsibilities under the
Act as well as the time involved in the legislative and rulemaking processes. Also, the Illinois DOT states that because
section 179 is the more detailed sanctions provision, under established principles of statutory construction and
interpretation, it must prevail over section 110(m). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IEPA suggests that if EPA determined to impose sanctions earlier than the 18-month period specified in section
179, EPA should develop specific criteria for when these early sanctions will be imposed, and provide notice and opportunity
for potentially affected parties to comment prior to imposing sanctions. The IEPA also indicates that these criteria
are necessary to avoid placing industries that are located in States that meet deadlines in a timely manner at a competitive
disadvantage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(m) provides that the Administrator ``*&blank;*&blank;* may apply any of the sanctions listed in section
179(b) (at any time or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding. *&blank;*&blank;*'' under section 179(a).
This language plainly authorizes sanctions without regard to a waiting period after a finding is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that section 179 is phrased to require sanctions after 18 months not, as the commenters say, to prohibit
sanctions before 18 months. Section 179 states ``for any implementation plan or plan revision required under this
part (or required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy as described in section 110(k)(5)), if the Administrator
[makes a finding], unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding *&blank;*&blank;*
one of the sanctions referred to in subparagraph (b) shall apply. *&blank;*&blank;*'' This provision mandatorily
imposes sanctions at 18 months if the deficiency has not been corrected, but does not prohibit sanctions earlier.
Because section 179 does not prohibit the earlier application of sanctions, it does not conflict with section 110(m),
which provides that sanctions may be imposed earlier than 18 months. Therefore, there is not a statutory construction
issue of whether section 179 needs to prevail over section 110(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the request by the IEPA that EPA develop specific criteria for when an early sanction will be imposed, the
EPA does not believe such criteria are statutorily required; however, since EPA will provide the public with an opportunity
to comment on any sanction action under section 110(m) through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to imposition
of the sanctions, the public will have the opportunity to comment on EPA's rationale for the application of sanctions
earlier than 18-months following the finding. Although EPA does not intend to develop specific criteria, Section
A(4) of this preamble provides further discussion on application of sanctions earlier than 18-months following
a finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to IEPA's concern about competitive disadvantage, imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) should benefit
sources located in those areas that make timely submittal of plans and plan revisions. Rather than delaying sanctions
until 18 months after a finding, under section 110(m) sanctions may be applied much earlier than 18 months. Therefore,
delinquent areas may be burdened much sooner than the 18-month period under section 179. Imposition of section 110(m)
sanctions should inhibit any advantage achieved through delayed submittal of required plans and revisions.

2. Application of Sanctions Beyond Nonattainment Areas Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters believe highway sanctions should not be imposed outside of a nonattainment area. The Texas DOT, New
York DOT, Illinois DOT and IEPA are concerned that EPA has not extended the nonattainment limitations of section 179
(a) and (b) to the imposition of sanctions under section 110(m). These commenters indicate that sanctions should
apply only to nonattainment areas. The Virginia DOT believes that section 110(m) sanctions should not extend beyond
a nonattainment area, except in extreme cases (such as where lack of good faith exists) and after a 24-month correction
period has passed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York DOT and IEPA believe that EPA's position regarding the geographic applicability of offset and highway
sanctions is inconsistent, and that the reasoning that is applied to make the offset sanction applicable to a specific
area should benefit the highway sanction as well. The IEPA feels that section 110(m) refers to the section 179(b) sanctions
without exempting the Administrator from complying with the geographic limitations specified in section 179(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois DOT comments that section 110(m) allows EPA to sanction an area less than a whole nonattainment area if
a unit of local government is really to blame.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York and Illinois DOT also state that since the statute is clear and understandable on its face, no reference
to legislative history is required or allowed. The Illinois DOT believes that section 110(m) should be viewed in conjunction
with section 179(b)(1), and if Congress had not meant to limit the use of highway funding sanctions to nonattainment
areas, it would not have placed that limitation in section 179(b). The Illinois DOT comments that Congressman Anderson
had prefaced his remarks as expressing the intent of only four members of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee. The commenter noted that in May 1990 the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent out a version of the Amendments
with no limit in section 179(b) on the area for sanctions (see H. Rep. No. 140, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Part 1). The House
Public Works Committee responded with a report of its own at that time amending section 110(m) and repeating almost
the same words quoted by EPA in the proposed rulemaking. Congressman Anderson's words may have been on the point then,
but they did not agree with the language of section 179(b) the way it was finally passed by Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the Illinois DOT cites the House Conference Committee Report which accompanied the final version of the Act
as evidence that sanctions are to be limited to nonattainment areas [H. Rep. No. 952, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 335&hyph;6;
Cong. Rec. H13101, 13197; Oct. 26, 1990; 1990 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 3385, 3867&hyph;8 (Discussing imposition
of sanctions ``*&blank;*&blank;* in an area that fails to prepare or implement a plan to attain air quality 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
standards. *&blank;*&blank;*'')].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To address the concerns of all five commenters, EPA believes that section 110(m) and section 179, although interrelated,
do set up two distinct sanctions processes. In general, section 179 provides for mandatory sanctions with respect
to failures under part D (in general, the nonattainment area provisions). As provided in the proposed rule, section
179 focuses on nonattainment areas in several respects (see 57 FR 44536&hyph;37). First, the general introductory
language of section 179(a) provides that sanctions must be imposed for a failure with respect to ``*&blank;*&blank;*
any implementation plan or plan revision required under this 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
part. *&blank;*&blank;*'' The provision is referring to part D of title I, the portion of the Act dealing with nonattainment
area requirements. While some part D requirements may also apply to attainment areas in limited circumstances, the
primary focus of part D is nonattainment areas. Second, the highway sanction language expressly limits the application
of sanctions under section 179(a) to nonattainment areas. Finally, the offset sanction requires new or modified
sources in complying with the requirements of section 173 to increase their offsets to 2:1. Typically, only sources
in nonattainment areas need to comply with section 173 and, therefore, in most instances the offset sanction will
only affect sources in nonattainment areas. For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 179(a) does not require
statewide imposition of sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, section 110(m) clearly provides for the imposition of sanctions beyond nonattainment areas. The
express language of section 110(m) provides that the Administrator may impose sanctions on ``*&blank;*&blank;*
any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
appropriate. *&blank;*&blank;*'' Beyond that, section 110(m) provides for the discretionary imposition of sanctions
for a finding that an area has failed to meet any requirement with respect to any ``plan or plan item'' under the Act.
Such requirements could apply to nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified areas. Although section 110(m) refers
to the sanctions established in section 179(b), there is no language stating that the geographical limitations in
section 179 override section 110(m)'s express authorization for sanctions on any part of the State that EPA determines
reasonable and appropriate. Section 110(m) refers only to the sanctions themselves, not the accompanying limitations.
For the above reasons, EPA believes that section 110(m) does establish its own geographic scope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Virginia DOT suggests that EPA should limit application of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment
area to circumstances where there is a lack of good faith. While EPA may take good faith into consideration in determining
the geographic scope of section 110(m) sanctions, EPA does not agree that it should establish lack of good faith as
a prerequisite for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions beyond the nonattainment area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the comment of Illinois DOT that EPA can sanction less than an entire nonattainment area, the Agency
agrees that under section 110(m)'s broad grant of authority for the imposition of discretionary sanctions, EPA may
select an area smaller than the nonattainment area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IEPA comments that EPA is treating the geographic limitations of the highway and offset sanctions differently
and that EPA should say that highway sanctions are also limited in scope. The EPA disagrees. First, we believe that
both sanctions may be imposed on any portion of the State. However, by its method of application, the offset sanction
will only have effect in those areas that must apply the emission offset requirements of section 173. Therefore, the
offset sanction would have no effect in certain areas. The highway sanction is not self-limiting; therefore, it will
have a broader effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the EPA did not rely on legislative history to override statutory language, but rather to support statutory
language that grants EPA discretion to apply sanctions to other than nonattainment areas. The Illinois DOT bases
its argument that the legislative history does not support the imposition of sanctions beyond the nonattainment
area on an assumption that section 110(m) does not provide an independent grant of authority to impose sanctions.
However, the Act does provide two separate grants of sanction authority with different geographic scopes; this is
supported by the language of the Act, as described above, and by the legislative authority. The language from H. Conf.
Rep. No. 101&hyph;952 that references the imposition of sanctions on an area that fails to attain the air quality standard
appears to refer to the imposition of sanctions under section 179 because it discusses the required imposition of
sanctions. The language cited by EPA in the preamble to the proposed rule addresses a different grant of statutory
authority to impose sanctions, namely, that authority under section 110(m). In addition, Illinois DOT cites H. Rep.
No. 101&hyph;490, which clearly provides that EPA may impose sanctions beyond nonattainment areas by stating that
EPA ``*&blank;*&blank;* is empowered to apply sanctions to any portion of a State.'' The committee goes on to clarify
how it believes EPA should use this broad grant of authority, indicating that EPA should impose sanctions on the governmental
entity that is ``primarily responsible,'' and noting that a State legislature's failure to adopt an inspection/maintenance
program is a circumstance where statewide sanctions are appropriate.

3. Section 110(m) Does Not Establish Independent Authority to Sanction 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Virginia DOT believes section 179 is the basis for imposing sanctions and is not superseded by section 110(m).
Furthermore, the Virginia DOT comments that section 110(m) expands on section 179 by requiring that an additional
minimum 6-month grace period must be observed after the initial 18-month period (i.e., 24 months) before sanctions
may be imposed on a statewide basis where a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.
The City of Chicago comments that EPA's proposed imposition of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) as an alternative
to section 179 would vitiate section 179. Once EPA determines none of the political subdivisions meet the criteria,
and thus the entire State is principally responsible for a section 179(a) deficiency, EPA is bound by the requirements
of section 179.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA agrees that sanctions cannot be imposed statewide within the first 24 months following a finding where a political
subdivision is found principally responsible for the deficiency. However, EPA disagrees that section 179 provides
the sole authority for imposing sanctions and, in doing so, allows for the imposition of statewide sanctions. As discussed
in the response to Comment 2 above, section 179 does not refer to the imposition of statewide sanctions and, in fact,
focuses on the imposition of sanctions in nonattainment areas. In fact, the EPA believes the reference to statewide
sanctions under section 110(m) makes it clear that section 110(m) establishes a different authority to sanction
States and that statewide sanctions are not required under section 179. Section 110(m) provides that statewide sanctions
shall not be applied within 24 months of the time a finding is made if a political subdivision is principally responsible
for the deficiency; this provision means that statewide sanctions may be imposed earlier than 24 months if no political
subdivision is found principally responsible. If section 179 required statewide sanctions after 18 months, it would
be contrary to the section 110(m) provision that sanctions shall not apply within the 24 months following the finding
if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. Therefore, EPA believes that its ability
to impose statewide sanctions during the 24-month period following a finding is based on a determination under section
110(m) that a political subdivision is not principally responsible for the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) does not vitiate section 179 because section 179 sanctions are not statewide but are imposed on the
specific area for which the deficiency arises, in most instances nonattainment areas. As stated previously, section
179 mandates that sanctions be imposed 18 months after a finding is made. While the imposition of sanctions earlier
under section 110(m) could remove the need to impose sanctions under section 179 sanctions in that area, section 179
has continued force and effect in areas where section 110(m) sanctions are not imposed. The EPA does not believe that
imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) conflicts with section 179 sanctions. Application of sanctions earlier
than 18 months is not inconsistent because EPA believes the purpose of section 179 was to ensure that EPA did not delay
sanctions beyond the periods prescribed in that action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) recommends adding a statement to the rule that EPA expects
to impose sanctions on a statewide basis earlier than 18 months only in limited circumstances, after notice-and-comment
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This statement was not in the proposed rule and EPA believes it should not be included in the final rule. The EPA stated
in the preamble to the proposed rule that it would only apply sanctions early in ``unusual circumstances where the
State has indicated explicit resistance to working to resolve a plan deficiency'' (see 57 FR 44534). The final rule
revises this preamble language because EPA believes the term ``unusual circumstances'' provides little guidance
as to when EPA intended to use its discretionary sanction authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA does not intend to use the section 110(m) authority in all situations where a finding is made, the Agency needs
to ascertain that it has the flexibility to use this option when necessary. In order to develop some plans or plan items,
States must perform certain steps that EPA can track to determine whether the State will meet deadlines in the Act.
When a State believes that EPA can impose sanctions only after a deadline is missed and 18 months have gone by, then there
is little incentive for the State to take the necessary actions to complete authorization and implementation of politically-difficult
rules and regulations. The EPA needs to maintain its flexibility to respond rapidly to situations where it appears
a State will not meet a deadline, and to assure the State that it does not, in fact, have an extended grace period for noncompliance.
The certainty and swiftness of imposition of the Act's penalties are critical to timely completion of the SIP's. Consequently,
the revised language, clarifies EPA's position concerning when discretionary sanctions may be appropriate while
retaining EPA's flexibility to use such sanctions to ensure compliance with the Act. Thus, EPA will exercise section
110(m) sanctions earlier than 18 months only in cases where:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State has indicated an explicit resistance to resolving a plan or program deficiency or to making a required
plan or program submittal; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Where special circumstances, particular program needs, or time constraints dictate the need for use of such sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the rule retains the Administrator's discretion to apply sanctions at any time after a finding is made; however,
EPA will provide notice and opportunity for comment on the basis for all section 110(m) actions.

 The City of Chicago believes the discretion in &sect;52.30(d)_that if the criteria are met EPA may impose sanctions
on a less than statewide basis to the area it determines is reasonable and appropriate_was not Congress' intent in
enacting section 110(m). The City of Chicago believes EPA's only discretion is whether to apply sanctions to political
subdivisions that meet the criteria. Thus, the City of Chicago believes EPA has no basis to apply sanctions when the
criteria are not met (i.e., to apply sanctions to political subdivisions that were thought to be principally responsible,
but did not meet the criteria, and to any other surrounding political subdivisions EPA determines is reasonable and
appropriate) and that to apply sanctions to these areas is arbitrary and capricious.

Response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(m) states that sanctions may be applied to any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable
and appropriate, with one exception. If one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible for the deficiency,
sanctions may not be applied statewide. Therefore, if the criteria are met, i.e., a political subdivision is principally
responsible, then EPA may not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. However, if no political subdivision is principally
responsible, the text of section 110(m) expressly authorizes EPA to move forward and impose sanctions on a statewide
basis. The EPA would make a determination, however, concerning what area of the State for which sanctions would be
reasonable and appropriate. Furthermore, EPA is not required to establish criteria to determine the area of the State
for which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions under section 110(m).

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four commenters, New York DOT, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), the City of Chicago, and the U.S.
DOT, requested clarification of how EPA will determine the ``reasonable and appropriate'' area to apply sanctions.
The City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT assert that the statute requires such clarification. The New York DOT believes
that the lack of adequate guidance on what area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' will create confusion and continual
uncertainty on the part of States as well as Federal agencies. The New York DOT suggests that the prime consideration
should be whether a good faith effort has been made to bring the nonattainment area into compliance. The New York DOT
believes that if this issue is not addressed in this rulemaking, it should be the subject of another rulemaking.

The OCTA cites the example of California, which consists of several regional authorities, which, in turn, each consist
of several local jurisdictions. The OCTA is concerned about how EPA would impose sanctions in the case where a regional
authority contains several local jurisdictions and where a local authority failed to do everything mandated by a
regional plan. The commenter believes it would be more reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions to the single
local jurisdiction, not the regional authority. In addition to assuring that the State does not suffer sanctions
if one political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency, the commenter suggests that EPA assure
that regions within a State would not be subject to sanctions if one or more local jurisdictions is/are principally
responsible for the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. DOT comments that in situations where a nonattainment area contains multiple political subdivisions, none
of which are principally responsible according to the five criteria, the rule must clarify how EPA will determine
whether to apply sanctions to the specific responsible political subdivision(s) rather than the entire nonattainment
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City of Chicago and U.S. DOT assert that the statutory mandate to promulgate criteria is not limited to the determination
of principal responsibility. These commenters argue that EPA must also develop criteria to determine when the imposition
of sanctions would be reasonable and appropriate, and the criteria should be sufficient to put potentially affected
political subdivisions on notice of the activities or agreements which may put them at risk of sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(m) specifically provides that EPA may impose sanctions on any part of the State that EPA deems is reasonable
and appropriate. Section 110(m) then requires that EPA ``*&blank;*&blank;* establish criteria for exercising
(this) authority *&blank;*&blank;* to ensure that *&blank;*&blank;* such sanctions are not applied on a statewide
basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible
for such deficiency.'' The EPA believes this language strictly limits the required development of criteria to those
necessary to determine if a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. There is no requirement
that the criteria must guide EPA's further decision of which area is ``reasonable and appropriate'' for the imposition
of sanctions. At this time, EPA does not have experience with imposing these sanctions and, therefore, does not want
to constrain the Agency in the exercise of this discretion. The variety of circumstances would make it difficult to
develop criteria that would be applicable in every instance. As to the comments of the City of Chicago and the U.S. DOT
that EPA needs to establish criteria for when it will impose sanctions under section 110(m), EPA does not believe that
such criteria are mandated. The public will have an opportunity to comment on EPA's determination of the area on which
it will impose sanctions and the timing of sanctions during each specific section 110(m) rulemaking action.

 The OCTA suggests that the rule clarify that all five criteria are to be met, not merely used, by EPA to determine if a
subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency. The OCTA suggests the following language: ``Criteria.
The EPA will use the following five criteria, all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision
is principally responsible for the deficiency.''

 The EPA agrees with this comment but determined that language other than that suggested would be clearer. Therefore,
EPA has revised &sect;52.30(d)(1) to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this action, EPA will consider a political
subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five
of the following criteria are met.''

 The New York DOT comments that the necessity for all five criteria to be met is overly strict and biased toward imposition
of sanctions statewide, and it may be difficult to establish that all five have been met. Therefore, the New York DOT
suggests that only a majority (three out of five) be met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA believes all five criteria are needed to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible.
The EPA sees no compelling reason to weaken this requirement. In addition, the failure to determine that one or more
areas are principally responsible does not presuppose the imposition of statewide sanctions; the EPA must determine
that the area sanctioned is the reasonable and appropriate area.

 The U.S. DOT requests clarification of what State actions are necessary to provide adequate legal authority under
the proposed Criterion 1. Criterion 1 states that the State must provide adequate legal authority to a political subdivision
to perform the required activity.

 The EPA does not believe that there is a single distinct definition of the term ``legal authority.'' What constitutes
adequate legal authority may vary from State to State. This should be handled on a case-by-case basis.

The New York DOT comments that under the proposed Criterion 2 [&sect;52.30(c)(2)], there must be a very clear agreement
in the SIP or some other document as to which functions are to be performed by which agencies. For example, functions
traditionally performed by local agencies may not be performed that way under the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA agrees with the commenter and encourages States to develop clear agreements as to which functions are being
performed by which agencies. Note in particular that section 174 of the Act requires States to jointly review and update,
as necessary, their planning procedures that were in effect before the Act was amended in 1990 or to develop new procedures
as appropriate. In preparing such procedures, State and local elected officials must determine which elements of
a revised SIP will be developed, adopted, and implemented by the State, and which elements will be carried out by local
or regional entities. The EPA has provided guidance on this and other section 174 requirements in a document entitled
``1992 Transportation and Air Quality Planning Guidelines'' (July 1992, EPA 420/R&hyph;92&hyph;001). The EPA
will work with the State and the political subdivision to ascertain if this criterion has been met. In addition, any
comments raised as to this issue during the rulemaking process on a specific section 110(m) action will be properly
considered by EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Concerning Criterion 4 [&sect;52.30(c)(4)], the U.S. DOT also comments there should be a provision included to provide
against ``State failure.'' If a local agency cancels an agreement to perform a certain function, it might leave the
State without the time or resources to perform the function. Thus, the State, instead of the local agency, would become
principally responsible. The U.S. DOT believes it would be inappropriate to apply statewide sanctions in such a case.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the local agency cancels its agreement to perform a function, EPA would take this into consideration when determining
whether the political subdivision is principally responsible in causing the deficiency. Moreover, this factor
may be considered in determining the area to which it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions. The EPA can
consider all factors in determining what area is reasonable and appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Massachusetts DOT believes the rule should contain a specific provision for State consultation in determining
principal responsibility because many factors such as regional demographic trends, changing local traffic patterns,
and land-use decisions in adjoining areas have a larger impact on emissions than institutional arrangements for
air quality planning. The proposed criteria may be the best way to evaluate whether the State or the political subdivision
is solely responsible for the emissions requirements, but it may not be relevant in targeting the actual source of
the problem or in defining solutions.

 To the extent it determines appropriate, EPA will consult with the State when evaluating the criteria under section
110(m). In any event, the State will have adequate opportunity to raise any such concerns in the comment period following
the notice of proposed rulemaking for imposition of section 110(m) sanctions.

 The State of Vermont comments that it is the only State in attainment with the ozone national ambient air quality standards
and also located within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. Vermont requests clarification in the rule of whether
attainment status or inclusion in the ozone transport region (OTR) is the deciding factor with respect to applicability
of these rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Neither attainment status nor inclusion in the OTR is the deciding factor. Under section 110(m), EPA may impose sanctions
on a statewide basis or on any area of the State deemed reasonable and appropriate based on the failure of the State or
a political subdivision of the State to meet a requirement of the Act with respect to a plan or plan element. If a requirement
is applicable to a political subdivision of the State, EPA will determine whether that political subdivision was
principally responsible for the failure, using the criteria established in this rulemaking. The EPA's ability to
use the section 110(m) sanctions is not limited to nonattainment areas or areas that must meet the title I, part D nonattainment
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The City of Chicago comments that the term ``required activity'' contravenes the definition of required activity
in section 179 and permits EPA to sanction entities without providing any prior notice that EPA considers a particular
action to be sanctionable. The City of Chicago also comments that since section 110(m) incorporates section 179(a),
EPA is not permitted to create a second, conflicting definition. Furthermore, the proposed definition does not identify
covered activities, and it does not give entities prior notice of sanctionable activities. Finally, the City of Chicago
is concerned about the ambiguity of the definition and that it may mean EPA is expanding the definition from section
179(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 179(a) does not define required activity. Rather, EPA believes this introductory phrase under section 179(a)
refers to submittals required under part D of the Act. The four general categories of activities listed in section
179(a) are the four possible types of State failure with respect to the required activities under part D. The types
of failure are not synonymous with required activities under the introductory language of section 179(a). Finally,
the City of Chicago contends that the definition of ``required activity'' is too open-ended because of the language
``may include, but is not limited to.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA interprets the term ``required activity'' for purposes of section 110(m) in a manner similar to that for section
179(a); however, EPA recognizes that for section 110(m), ``required activity'' refers to any plan or plan item requirement
under the Act, not just those required under part D. Finally, EPA agrees that the language ``may include, but is not
limited to'' may provide broader authority than that granted under section 110(m). Therefore, EPA has changed the
definition in the final rule to provide: ``The term `required activity' refers to the submission of a plan or plan item
or the implementation of a plan or plan item under the Clean Air Act.''

 The OCTA and the U.S. DOT request clarification of the term ``political subdivision.'' Both commenters appear concerned
about whether EPA in making a determination of ``principal responsibility'' may consider less than the entire nonattainment
area. The OCTA notes that California has several regional authorities that each are composed of numerous local jurisdictions.
These local jurisdictions often have the responsibility for ``adopting and implementing air pollution controls.''

 The definition of ``political subdivision'' set forth in &sect;52.30(a)(1) includes all types of governmental
entities, including local jurisdictions. The EPA could sanction less than an entire nonattainment area based on
a determination that a local jurisdiction was principally responsible for the deficiency on which the sanction is
based.

 The OCTA comments that the proposed rule should include a definition of ``plan item.'' The OCTA notes that section
110(m) reads in part ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;in relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by the
Administrator). *&blank;*&blank;*'' The OCTA cites the example of the California SIP, which is partially composed
of regional plans. Some regional plans require local jurisdictions to take certain actions, which to the commenter
appear to be plan items.

 As discussed earlier, to make this clearer, EPA replaces the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' under &sect;52.30(a)(2)
with the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' Although EPA interpreted the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' to essentially
mean the same as the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' this replacement is more consistent with the language of section
110(m) which refers to ``plan or plan item.'' ``Plan and plan item'' are also defined under &sect;52.30(a)(4).

 The Texas DOT, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), and the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission
(NIRPC) asked EPA to identify which sanction will be applied for various types of SIP deficiencies. These commenters
all state that the sanction should be tied to the underlying deficiency. For example, the commenters state that highway
sanctions should only be applied when there is a SIP deficiency relative to mobile sources and the offset sanction
where the deficiency is relative to stationary sources. The CMA recommends adding extra language to the rule as follows:
``The EPA will assess the nature of the deficiencies and take this into account when determining which sanction to
apply.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIRPC further asserts that only those projects which have the potential for increasing emissions should be targeted;
withholding highway funds which may correct a problem is inappropriate.

 The type of sanction to be applied and the selection procedure are not part of this rulemaking. Sanction determinations

of sanctions under section 110(m). The notice will propose for comment which sanctions or sanction will be applied.
In addition, the Act sets forth those projects exempted from the highway funding restrictions. The EPA will act consistently

The Massachusetts DOT comments that EPA's authority to sanction a State if ``*&blank;*&blank;* a requirement of
an approved plan is not being implemented is too broad, given the large number of agencies, regulatory authorities,
and group interests which can prevent a planned project from being implemented.'' Instead, a State's good faith effort

The types of findings that may lead to the imposition of sanctions are specified in the Act; they are not being developed
by this rulemaking. Therefore, once a finding of failure to implement a plan has been made, section 179(a) requires
that the 18-month mandatory sanctions clock begins. Furthermore, any finding made under section 179(a) provides
EPA with discretion to impose sanctions under section 110(m).

``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity,

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C 605(b), the Administrator hereby certifies that the attached rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since the rule requires EPA to consider criteria
before applying sanctions on a statewide basis, it potentially could result in a reduced burden on small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this provision, EPA will consider a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the
deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five of the following criteria are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State has provided adequate legal authority to a political subdivision to perform the required activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on a statewide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If not all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section have been met through the action or inaction of one political

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 25, 1993 EPA published the notices of proposed rulemaking to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM) in each State. The implementation
plans were submitted by the States to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to
ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply
with the CAA. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposals. No comments were received pursuant to these
proposed actions. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revisions to the North Dakota and Utah SIPs
for establishing a PROGRAM in each State.

I. Background of Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States of North Dakota and Utah submitted SIP revisions to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507
of the CAA. In order to gain full approval, the State's submittals must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses required by section 507(a); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process which is required by section 507(a)(3); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP
required by section 507(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Submittals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of North Dakota has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements
all required PROGRAM elements. N.D.C.C. sections 23&hyph;25&hyph;02 and 23&hyph;25&hyph;03 grants the Department
the authority to undertake the elements of the PROGRAM. The Governor, through Executive Order 1992&hyph;5, established
the Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel. The North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories
(the Department) formally adopted the SIP revision on October 23, 1992, which identifies a plan to implement the PROGRAM.
This SIP revision is being added to the North Dakota SIP as section 12. The North Dakota PROGRAM was submitted to EPA
by the Governor of North Dakota on November 2, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness.
In a letter dated December 15, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive
determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January 18, 1993, EPA notified the
State in a letter dated February 2, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. The submittal
then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its SIP revision section 12.5 to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State has met the second PROGRAM element
by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office of the Chief of the Environmental Health Section
effective April 6, 1992, as stated in its SIP revision section 12.3. The State has met the third PROGRAM element through
Executive Order 1992&hyph;5 dated May 21, 1992, issued by the Governor of North Dakota, which established a Small
Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of North Dakota, and by outlining in its SIP revision section 12.4
the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally,
the State of North Dakota has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. This mechanism is contained in section 12.2 of the State's SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Utah has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required
PROGRAM elements. Section 19&hyph;2&hyph;109.2 of the Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended authorizes the Utah
Air Quality Board to establish a SBAP, and create a Compliance Advisory Panel. A new section 17, which is a plan for implementation
of the SBAP, will be added to the Utah SIP. R307&hyph;2 of the Utah Air Conservation Rules incorporates this SIP revision
by reference. The Utah PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Utah on November 9, 1992, with supplemental information
sent on November 5, 1992, and January 11, 1993. EPA notified the State in a letter dated December 30, 1992, that the submittal
was administratively and technically complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received
a concurrence from all reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Utah has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in section 17.3 of its regulations to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) of the CAA for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State of Utah has met the second
PROGRAM element by locating the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of the Executive Director, as stated in section 17.5.1 of its regulations. The State of Utah has met the third
PROGRAM element by outlining in sections 17.4.1 and 2 of its regulations the functions of the CAP and how the members
will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e) of the CAA. Additionally, the State of Utah has established
a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation
of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. This mechanism is contained in section
17.2 of the State's regulations.

III. Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the SIP revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah. The revisions were made to satisfy
the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, EPA is approving two State programs created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. These programs do not impose any new regulatory burdens on
small businesses; they are programs under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided
by the States. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

The Governor of Utah submitted on November 9, 1992 a plan to develop and implement a Small Business Assistance Program
to meet the requirements of section 507 of the Clean Air Act by November 15, 1994. The plan commits to provide technical
and compliance assistance to small businesses, hire an Ombudsman to serve as an independent advocate for small businesses,
and establish a Compliance Advisory Panel to advise the program and report to EPA on the program's effectiveness.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) amends several existing rules that govern procedures for hearings and appeals
under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 in order to bring the rules up to date. Because of events
that have occurred since they were adopted, the existing rules omit references or contain incorrect references,
are inconsistent with other rules, or fail to provide necessary information or procedures. The amendments correct
these defects. In this document OHA also updates telephone numbers of offices of field solicitors and field offices
of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), listed in the existing rules, to reflect changes
which have been effected heretofore.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 19, 1991, OHA proposed amendments to existing procedural rules governing hearings and appeals under
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988), because rules subsequently adopted or cases decided have rendered the existing rules out of date or shown
them to be incomplete or inaccurate. See 56 FR 58330&hyph;58332 (Nov. 19, 1991). No comments were received on the published
proposed amendments. The amendments effected by this final rulemaking are explained below under the heading for
each rule involved.

Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1100
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of previous amendments of 43 CFR 4.1109(a) to provide current addresses and jurisdictions of field solicitors
who are to be served documents (see 56 FR 2139, 2142&hyph;43 (Jan. 22, 1991), 56 FR 5061 (Feb. 7, 1991)), the definition
of ``field solicitor'' in 43 CFR 4.1100(d) is superfluous. It was proposed to remove that definition and redesignate
the following definitions in alphabetical order. No comments were received on this proposal. That definition is
therefore removed and the following definitions (e) and (f) are redesignated (d) and (e).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30 CFR 842.15(d) provides a right of appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) under 43 CFR 4.1280

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the written determination, after informal review by the Director of the OSM or his or her designee, concerning the
decision of an authorized representative of the Secretary not to inspect or take enforcement action concerning an
alleged violation that is the subject of a request for a federal inspection under 30 CFR 842.12.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, 30 CFR 843.12(i) provides that any determination by an authorized representative of the Secretary granting
or denying an abatement period exceeding 90 days under 30 CFR 842.12(h) shall contain a right of appeal to IBLA under
1280 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the Board has had occasion to observe, however, 43 CFR 4.1105 does not name the permittee of the operation that is
the subject of a determination of the Director or an authorized representative, or any person whose interests might
be adversely affected by the outcome on appeal and who participated before OSM, as a party who must be served with a copy
of the notice of appeal and statement of reasons under 43 CFR 4.1283(a) and who may participate under &sect;&sect;4.1284
and 4.1286. See Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc., 108 IBLA 70, 83 n.7, 96 I.D. 139, 146 n.7 (1989). OHA therefore
proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1105(a) by adding subsection (5) naming such permittees and persons as parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After this addition to 43 CFR 4.1105(a) was proposed, however, the Board decided Robert L. Clewell, 123 IBLA 253 (1992).
In that case, citizens who had requested their identity be kept confidential, in accordance with 30 CFR 842.12(b),
later revealed their identity to the coal company whose operation they had requested be inspected by sending a copy
of their statement of reasons of appealing the denial of their request for inspection to the company. Had they not done
so, under the terms of &sect;842.12(b), their ``identity may not be revealed, even to other parties to a case, unless
and until a competent official acting in response to a formal request filed under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) or other Federal
law has determined that [their] identity must be made public because it does not fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)
(1988) or any other exemption from disclosure provided by law. See 42 FR 62665&hyph;66 (Dec. 13, 1977).'' Robert L.
Clewell,

 at 257 n.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this decision, OHA has added a statement to the new &sect;4.1105(a)(5) that a person who wishes his or
her identity kept confidential under 30 CFR 842.12(b) is responsible for maintaining that confidentiality when
serving documents in accordance with &sect;4.1109.

OSM amended 30 CFR 723.19(a) and 845.19(a) to provide 30 days rather than 15 days in which a person may file a petition
for review of a proposed civil penalty with the Hearings Division of OHA after the date of service of notice of an assessment
conference officer's action. See 56 FR 10060, 10063 (Mar. 8, 1991). OHA therefore proposed to amend the corresponding
procedural rule, 43 CFR 4.1151(b), to provide the same time and to add a reference to 30 CFR 845.18. No comments were
received on the proposed change, so it is adopted.

The references to 30 CFR part 723 in 43 CFR 4.1152(a)(2); to 30 CFR 723.15 in 43 CFR 4.1154(a); and to 30 CFR 723.12 and
723.13 in 43 CFR 4.1157 (a) and (b) need to be updated by correcting the references in 43 CFR 4.1154(a) and in 43 CFR 4.1157
(a) and (b) and by adding references to the corresponding sections in 30 CFR part 845. OHA proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1152,

Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1271(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When 43 CFR part 4, subpart L was originally promulgated in 1978, 43 CFR 4.1271(a) provided that an aggrieved party
could file a ``notice of appeal'' from an order or decision of an administrative law judge disposing of a proceeding
``under this subpart, except a civil penalty proceeding under &sect;4.1150.'' This is still the language of the rule.
Since 1978, however, other rules have been added to subpart L that provide for a ``petition for discretionary review,''
rather than a notice of appeal, as the document to file with IBLA when seeking review of the initial decision of an administrative
law judge. See 43 CFR 4.1309, 4.1369 (56 FR 2139, 2144, Jan. 22, 1991; 56 FR 5061, Feb. 7, 1991). OHA has also proposed
rules that provide for petitions for discretionary review. See 43 CFR 4.1377, 4.1387 (56 FR 45806, Sept. 6, 1991).
Further, special procedures for seeking IBLA review exist for other proceedings in subpart L. See 43 CFR 4.1187, 4.1196,
4.1391.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is possible for IBLA to clarify by decision which avenue of appeal is appropriate for each proceeding,
see

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 107 IBLA 329 (1989), it is preferable for the procedural rules themselves to contain this information. OHA therefore
proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1271(a) so that the rule will specify for which proceedings a notice of appeal is appropriate.
No comments on the proposed change were received, so it is adopted. Proceedings not covered by the procedural rules
set forth in the revised &sect;4.1271(a) contain special provisions for seeking review of initial decisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amended Rule retains the Rule's primary itemization, price and other disclosure requirements, without major,
substantive modification; expressly prohibits non-declinable fees (such as so-called ``casket handling fees''
or ``basic facilities fees'') charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director
and staff; deletes the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement, but retains the obligation to give price and
other information to consumers who request it over the telephone; and contains a series of changes to the original
Rule in the nature of fine-tuning and technical revisions designed to make the Rule more effective and to facilitate
compliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview of the Original Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission promulgated the original Rule on September 24, 1982, making it fully effective on April 30, 1984.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's decision to promulgate the Rule was appealed, and was subsequently affirmed in Harry &amp; Bryant
Co. v.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 FTC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Funeral Rule declares it an unfair or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to: (1) fail to furnish price
information to funeral consumers; (2) require consumers to purchase items they do not desire to buy; and (3) embalm
deceased human remains for a fee without authorization. The Rule further declares it a deceptive practice for funeral
providers to misrepresent: (1) the necessity for embalming, caskets for cremation, and grave vaults or grave liners;
(2) legal and cemetery requirements; (3) preservation and protection capabilities of funeral goods and services;
and (4) cash advance charges for items arranged for by the funeral provider on the consumer's behalf.

 The Rule had two effective dates. Those portions of the Rule that prohibit certain oral or written representations
became effective on January 1, 1984. 48 FR 45537 (Oct. 6, 1983). The remainder of the Rule_the portions imposing affirmative
obligations on funeral providers_became effective on April 30, 1984. Id. The effective date of &sect;453.3(b)(1)(ii)
of the Rule was changed from January 1, 1984 to April 30, 1984. 49 FR 564 (Jan. 5, 1984).

 726 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 820 (1984). The Court held that the Funeral Rule did not, as alleged,
exceed the Commission's authority under &sect;&sect;5 and 18 of the FTC Act and did not violate funeral directors'
First Amendment rights of commercial free speech.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent those practices and to correct consumers' misimpressions, the Rule contains several remedial requirements.
The Rule requires that funeral providers: (1) Disclose written price information by means of a General Price List
(``GPL''), Casket Price List (``CPL''), and an outer burial container price list (``OBC&hyph;PL'') to persons who
inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;&sect;453.2(b)(2)-(4));
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (2) Give purchasers a written statement, after they have selected funeral goods and services, containing the prices
for each of the items selected, the total price for the funeral arrangements selected, price estimates or actual costs,
if known, for cash advance items, and any legal, cemetery or crematory requirements that compel the purchase of any
items or services for the particular funeral (&sect;453.2(b)(5)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rule permits providers to incorporate the information from the casket and outer burial container price lists
in the general price list. This combined list also must be offered to persons who inquire in person about funeral arrangements
or the prices of funeral goods and services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Affirmatively disclose to telephone callers who inquire about funeral ``terms, prices or conditions'' that
price information is available over the telephone (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(i));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclose specific price information over the telephone to persons who call and request it (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(ii));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Make truthful representations about legal and other requirements that compel the purchase of particular items
or services (&sect;453.3)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Allow consumers to select and purchase only those goods and services they desire (rather than offering goods and
services only in predetermined packages) (&sect;453.4(b));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Seek express approval before embalming the deceased for a fee (&sect;453.5)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Make truthful representations about the preservative and protective value of funeral goods and services (&sect;453.3(e));

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Disclose that they charge a fee for obtaining cash advance items, if that is the case (&sect;453.3(f)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Make unfinished wood boxes or alternative containers available for direct cremation, if the provider offers
direct cremation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;453.4(a)(2)).

The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose stated that the essential purpose of the Rule is to lower barriers
to price competition in the funeral market and facilitate informed consumer choice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rule thus seeks to ensure that consumers have access to sufficient information to permit informed purchase decisions,
that consumers are not required to purchase items they do not want and are not required by law to purchase, and that misrepresentations
are not used to influence consumer purchase decisions.

Rule.

B. The Amended Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in promulgating the amended Rule, seeks to increase the Rule's potential benefits to consumers by
clarifying its requirements and reducing actual or potential compliance burdens on the funeral industry. Such action
should increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosure and other obligations.
Based on the record in this proceeding, the Commission has concluded that the low levels of industry compliance with,
and consumer awareness of, the Rule do not permit a full cost-benefit analysis of its impact, because the analysis
does not capture the full effects of the Rule had there been greater compliance. Despite this finding, the Commission
has determined from the record evidence that the Rule is providing pro-competitive and informational benefits to
consumers that outweigh its costs to providers, and that those benefits, but not costs, are likely to increase over
time as Rule compliance and consumer awareness of their rights under the Rule increase. The Commission has further
concluded that the record in this proceeding does not contain a sufficient basis to overturn the Rule's presumptive
validity as a legally promulgated rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has concluded, however, that clarifying amendments to the price disclosure and ``unbundling'' provisions
of the Rule are necessary to clarify that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice to impose non-declinable fees
in addition to the one for ``basic services of funeral director and staff,'' permitted under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).
These amendments effectively eliminate the imposition of so-called ``casket handling fees'' as separate non-declinable
fees charged to consumers who purchase caskets from non-funeral home sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has determined that these fees serve to frustrate the Rule's basic ``unbundling'' requirement by
penalizing consumers who decline caskets sold by the funeral home and instead purchase them from third party sellers.
The emergence of third-party casket sellers, and consequently, those fees, have developed in the market since the
Rule's promulgation.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent that these fees include a charge for provider overhead that is not allocated to other items offered for
sale, the amended Rule does not prohibit their inclusion in the non-declinable services fee permitted under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission further has concluded that repeal of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(i))
is warranted because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits. The record evidence indicates that the
affirmative telephone disclosure is an inartful and unnecessary signal to consumers about the availability of price
information. The Commission has determined that the Rule's other price disclosure provisions are adequate, and
that this provision is unlikely to provide substantial additional benefits to consumers. Record evidence indicates
that the Rule is contributing now to increased consumer ``price-sensitivity'' that results in some consumer shopping
for lower-cost providers and services. Consumers who call to first arrange a date and time for a funeral service, however,
or who request the removal of remains, likely expect an empathetic response, and may be seriously offended by the uninvited
offer to discuss prices. Some consumers in that circumstance are likely to interpret the affirmative disclosure
as an indication of an unwarranted provider concern with the consumer's ability to afford services. The provision's
likely inability to benefit consumers does not justify the imposition of such undue awkwardness and potential offense
in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission has concluded
that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the requirement
to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission further has adopted a variety of minor, ``fine-tuning'' amendments in light of the evidence on industry
compliance. Those amendments are designed to clarify the Rule's requirements and reduce actual or potential compliance
burdens in order to increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosures. Those
amendments, which do not alter providers' basic obligations or consumers' rights under the Rule, concern the timing
of giving the general price list and other disclosure requirements, the casket and outer burial container price list
disclosures, and the general ``unbundling'' provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission has adopted several technical Rule amendments that are necessary to correct inconsistencies
or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other recommended amendments.

Little, if any, systematic or otherwise reliable evidence in the record documents industry-wide deceptive or unfair
practices concerning Rule-related issues by cemeteries, crematories that do not sell funeral goods, or other sellers
of funeral goods or funeral services not presently subject to the Rule. Therefore, the Commission has declined to
expand the Rule to cover such entities, as recommended by some rulemaking participants. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR)
at 109&hyph;121 for a full discussion of the evidence on this issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission's Findings in 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission required this unique review to determine, at an early date: (1) Whether the Rule is operating as expected
in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing informed consumer choice, or whether some modification
is necessary to facilitate those benefits; and (2) whether there is a need to continue the Rule after it has had an opportunity
to work in the marketplace; termination would be considered if increased competition has largely corrected the problems
addressed by the Rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission determined, however, that the Rule's effects on the funeral market may be evidenced more slowly than
in other industries due to factors it found unique to the funeral transaction.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 One of those factors was that many consumers would not have exposure to the Rule-required price lists and other provisions
for many years because purchases of funerals are infrequent. Unlike other situations, consumers also are unusually
susceptible to influence from the funeral director's advice because of the unique combination of emotional stress,
lack of experience and information, and tight time constraints. The Commission predicted as a result that the initial
stimulus for price competition would likely come from existing or new providers that begin to advertise and otherwise
compete on the basis of price. The Commission concluded that it could not say how quickly the Rule's competitive impact
would begin to be felt in light of traditional industry constraints on price competition and barriers to entry.

The Commission nonetheless predicted that the Rule could provide economic benefits for consumers in various ways.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Should greater price competition emerge, for example, the Rule could reduce or hold stable actual prices and overall
consumer expenditures for funerals. This would most likely result from increased consumer price-sensitivity,
which might lead some consumers to shift from higher to lower-priced providers. Expenditures could also be reduced
as consumers decline items previously required in packaged funerals, and as unfair or deceptive acts or practices
that induced consumer purchases decline. Finally, the Commission determined that mandatory price itemization
was warranted even if some consumers knowingly chose to buy more goods and services than they would have under package-only
pricing. The purpose of the Rule is to enhance consumer choice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finally determined that, while competition induced by the Rule could reduce price levels, mandatory
itemization presented opportunities for providers to voluntarily raise prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Providers could choose to raise itemized prices or the price for the lowest-priced funeral, for example, in order
to increase profits or account for increased consumer declinations of certain items. The Commission reasoned, however,
that itemization does not require those results because it does not preclude traditional industry pricing methods,
such as package pricing and ``graduated recovery'' of proportionately more overhead from higher-priced funerals.
The Commission further concluded that providers may not be able to raise prices simply to recoup lost revenue or increase
profits as price competition increases under the Rule.

2. The Mandatory Review Proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission on December 9, 1987 published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (hereafter ``ANPR'') describing
the planned review of the Funeral Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ANPR notified the public that the Commission intended to conduct the rulemaking, and solicited public comments
on many of the key Rule-related issues. The ANPR contained 44 questions concerning consumer and funeral provider
experiences, the scope of the Rule, compliance, various Rule provisions, regulatory flexibility and the paperwork
burden imposed by the Rule. The majority of the commenters
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recommended retention of the Rule. Funeral director trade groups recommended repeal or, in the alternative, substantial
modification and expansion of the Rule to cover other sellers, such as cemeteries.

 The Commission in the NPR established a schedule for three public hearings to be held in Washington, Chicago, and San
Francisco, and requested comment on a number of questions set out in the notice. In all, 189 individuals and groups
submitted written comments, including two funeral directors, five cemetery/crematory/third-party casket seller
groups or individuals, six funeral director trade associations, 147 consumers, 27 consumer/memorial society groups,
one federal official and one state group.

Based on requests from interested parties who wished to question witnesses at the public hearings, the Presiding
Officer designated four groups for that purpose: (1) The Consumer Interest Group, including the American Association
of Retired Persons and the Continental Association of Funeral and Memorial Societies; (2) the Funeral Director Group,
including the National Funeral Directors Association and the National Selected Morticians (that group also included
William Pierson, the owner of the Hursen Funeral Home, the Illinois Funeral Directors Association, and the Conference
of Funeral Service Examining Boards; (3) the Crematory and Prearrangement Group, including the Cremation Association
of North America and the Pre-Arrangement Association of America; and (4) the Special Cemetery Group, including the
American Cemetery Association. The Presiding Officer established the last group for the limited purpose of conducting
examination on whether the Rule should be expanded to include cemeteries. See R&hyph;A&hyph;37.

In April 1989, Rebuttal Submissions were filed by the staff, the Cremation Association of North America (``CANA''),
the Monument Builders of North America (``MBNA''), the National Funeral Directors Association (``NFDA'') and National
Selected Morticians (``NSM'') (joint rebuttal), the American Cemetery Association (``ACA''), the American Association
of Retired Persons (``AARP'') and the Pre-Arrangement Association of America (``PAA''). In response to a request
from the Presiding Officer, those groups other than the staff also filed Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law and Recommended Decision in May 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to all of the testimonial and written information just described, the record contains three national
surveys of actual funeral arrangers, conducted in 1981, 1987 and 1988. The 1981 Baseline Study (or ``BLS'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was conceived as a benchmark for later comparison with the 1987 Replication Study (or ``RS'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conducted for the Commission, these studies examined: (1) Consumer purchasing behavior and expenditures for funerals;
(2) consumer knowledge of the funeral market; and (3) industry practices and prices. By comparing the results of the
two studies, inferences could be drawn about the Funeral Rule's impact on the funeral market. The Bureau of Economics
Report of February 1989
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contains that comparative analysis. The Gallup Organization conducted the third, and most recent, study of funeral
arrangers for the AARP.

 Viewed together, those three empirical surveys represent the most reliable and comprehensive systematic data available
on consumer experiences under the Rule in shopping for and choosing funeral goods and services, and of industry Rule
compliance.

With respect to the BLS, however, the 1982 rulemaking staff concluded from its review of a telephone validation study
that the BLS data were subject to qualification and differing interpretation in four specific areas where the data
appeared to conflict with evidence already on the original record_consumers' receipt of telephone price information,
written itemized price information and itemized statements, and requests for permission to embalm. See R&hyph;B&hyph;70
(Memorandum from Funeral Rule Staff to Commission, ``Impact Evaluation Survey, Funeral TRR,'' July 15, 1982). The
Commission in its comparative analysis of the Baseline and Replication study data does not rely on the Baseline data
in those four areas.

In addition to these empirical studies, statistical data and testimony presented by Mr. Wendell Hahn of the Federated
Funeral Directors of America (hereafter ``FFDA''), an independent firm that provides financial and business consulting
services to some 1,500 independent funeral homes in 30 states, representing about 10% of all funerals per year, afforded
evidence on changes in funeral home costs of operation and prices under the Rule. A 1988 national survey of 500 funeral
directors presented by the AARP provided similar evidence.

members regarding changes in provider practices under the Rule. The record further contains two national opinion
surveys concerning consumers' views about, and knowledge of, various Rule requirements, and five other surveys
of cemeterians, cremationists, monument builders and memorial societies conducted by interested groups on specific,
Rule-related issues.

The rulemaking staff and Presiding Officer published their respective Reports in June and July 1990, summarizing
the record evidence and recommending, with minor differences, retention of the Rule, repeal of the affirmative telephone
disclosure, prohibition of separate non-declinable fees, in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services
of funeral director and staff, such as so-called ``casket handling fees,'' and the adoption of several ``fine-tuning''
amendments.

The Office of the Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, favored a limited review by the Bureau of the amended Rule
to measure its impact, in particular the prohibition of ``casket handling fees.'' See Memorandum from Gerald Caplan,
Deputy Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, to the Commission, June 20, 1991 at 5. The Bureau of Economics recommended
the inclusion of a future and final mandatory review of the Rule under the rulemaking procedures of section 18 of the
FTC Act. See Memorandum from Peter Vander Nat, Bureau of Economics, to the Commission, August 26, 1991 at 3. The Commission
has not adopted either recommendation, but has scheduled the Funeral Rule for a mandatory ``notice and comment''
review in 1999, in accordance with its ten-year review schedule adopted for all Commission rules and guides. See 58
FR 11554 (Feb. 25, 1992).

On November 21, 1991, representatives of the NFDA, NSM, AARP, CANA, ACA, MBNA and PAA made oral presentations to the
Commission concerning this review proceeding. On January 28, 1993, after reviewing the rulemaking record as a whole,
the Commission voted unanimously to retain and amend the Rule, incorporating all of the substantive changes recommended
by the rulemaking staff and the Bureau of Economics.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Legal Standard for Amending the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 18(d)(2)(B) of the FTC Act states that ``[a] substantive amendment to, or repeal of, a rule promulgated under
subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be prescribed, and subject to judicial review, in the same manner as a rule prescribed
under such subsection.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the standard of judicial review for amendment to, or repeal of, a section 18 rule is identical to that for any rule
prescribed pursuant to section 18. Upon judicial review, a section 18 rule may be set aside if it is ``arbitrary, capricious''
or otherwise not in accordance with law upon any of the grounds set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
at 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)&hyph;(D), or if the factual determinations upon which the rule is based are not supported by
``substantial evidence'' in the rulemaking record as a whole.

In their Proposed Findings, funeral director groups assert

that the current rulemaking is subject to the same standards and procedures as a de novo rulemaking. Therefore, they
appear to contend that the Commission must support any decision, including the retention of the Funeral Rule, on a

R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 213&hyph;214. The NFDA/NSM further suggest that any change in the Rule's requirements
(other than repeal) must be based on new evidence that current practices are unfair or deceptive, in accordance with
the Commission's regulatory authority. Id. at 220&hyph;221. The amended Rule, however, except as noted, covers
no other new acts, practices, or sellers of funeral goods or services. Moreover, the Commission concludes that the
NFDA/NSM position is inaccurate. The Commission when it promulgated the Rule determined that the covered practices
were unfair or deceptive, as the Rule states. The Rule, however, also contains many ``preventive requirements''
designed to remedy those practices. Those preventive requirements may be modified without an entirely new record,
as discussed in the accompanying text. As the Commission stated in mandating this review, one of its purposes was to
determine whether the Rule is operating as expected in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing consumer
choice, or whether some modification is necessary to facilitate those benefits. R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42299.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This view is incorrect. A decision to retain any portion of the current Rule may be based upon evidence gathered during
the original rulemaking and the Commission's subsequent enforcement experience, as well as evidence adduced during
the current rulemaking. Indeed, to the extent that nothing supplements evidence from the initial rulemaking, there
is a presumption that the existing rule should be retained.

As discussed elsewhere in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, the Commission has evaluated the relative costs and
benefits of the Rule, industry compliance, the Rule's effect on competition and consumer awareness, and a number
of other factors, to determine whether to retain, amend, or repeal the Rule. In making that determination, the Commission
has taken into account, among other things, the comments received in this rulemaking as well as the record established
in the original rulemaking proceeding and the Commission's experience in enforcing the existing Rule. The Commission
believes that its decision to retain certain provisions of the Rule while supplementing or amending others, as described
in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, comports with the legal standards discussed earlier governing Section 18
rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vast majority of rulemaking participants supported the Rule's retention, or its expansion to cover other sellers.
Of the 189 NPR commenters and 83 public hearing witnesses, only eight unequivocally advocated repeal of the Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two participants suggested repeal as an alternative, if the Commission declined to make various substantive amendments;
two advocated repeal because, in their view, existing state laws were deemed adequate to protect consumers.

Those four include: The NSM (R&hyph;G&hyph;3; R&hyph;M&hyph;9 at 224) (repeal unless major amendments are adopted
as proposed and a ``sunset'' date is mandated); the NYS Funeral Directors Association (R&hyph;G&hyph;4) (Rule is
redundant to New York law); Mr. Hocker, President, NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1399, 1400, 1444&hyph;1445 (NFDA advocates
repeal, but his personal objections are limited to three areas_affirmative telephone disclosure, GPL timing and
distribution, and prior permission to embalm; otherwise, the Rule has educated consumers about the funeral process
and many providers say they are not overly burdened by the Rule); and Mr. Farrow, Exec. Dir, Texas Funeral Service Commission,
Tr. Vol. III, 550&hyph;551, 573 (Rule is unnecessary in light of Texas funeral law, which is patterned after the Rule
and benefits consumers).

The NFDA, the largest association of funeral industry firms, was the major proponent of repeal,
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 asserting that repeal is warranted because the Rule has imposed significant costs but failed to provide its promised
benefits of increased competition and altered patterns of consumer behavior. According to the NFDA, the evidence
shows that consumers in selecting funeral providers and types of funeral service still place a higher importance
on social, moral and practical factors (such as provider reputation and quality of service) than they do on price.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The NFDA concluded that the evidence logically demonstrates that consumers under the Rule spend no less for funeral
arrangements, comparison shop no more, and purchase no fewer items and no different types of service than they did
before the Rule. The NFDA asserted that the Rule has imposed various monetary costs on providers that have been passed
on to consumers in the form of higher prices, as well as non-monetary costs that interfere with providers' ability
to give caring, quality service. The NFDA thus concluded that the Rule should be repealed in its entirety because its
costs outweigh its benefits.

One issue raised during the proceedings was whether individual members of the NFDA or other trade groups agree that
the Rule warrants repeal. Several surveys and other evidence introduced into the record indicated that many funeral
directors may not wholly agree with the NFDA view. See, e.g., HX&hyph;32 (American Funeral Director magazine survey
asked its funeral director readers ``How would you recommend that the NFDA deal with the Funeral Rule during the forthcoming
Review?'' 70% responded that the Rule should be accepted as is or partially modified, 12% suggested substantial modification,
and 20% repeal; 88% of firms represented by respondent funeral directors were NFDA members); See also, Hocker, President,
NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1400 (many funeral directors say they are not overly burdened by the Rule); Hunter, President,
NSM, Tr. Vol. I, 790&hyph;791 (majority of NSM members do not advocate repeal; parts of it have been very helpful);
Ayers, HX&hyph;108 at 3 (68% of 500 funeral directors surveyed agreed that the Rule's required information was beneficial
to consumers).

However, the NFDA suggested that price plays a greater role in consumers' selections of individual items involved
in the funeral, such as caskets and outer burial containers. R&hyph;M&hyph;9 at 20.

In contrast to the NFDA's view, the AARP provided the most vigorous support for retention of the Rule.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The AARP advocated that a decision to repeal the Rule must be founded on substantial evidence demonstrating that:
(1) The acts and practices addressed by the Rule are no longer prevalent; (2) the harm resulting from those practices
has been removed; (3) repeal would not permit the return of that harm; and (4) the benefits of repeal exceed the costs
of continuing the Rule. According to the AARP, those questions cannot be answered, and the Rule's full impact cannot
be assessed, because the record evidence reveals unacceptably low levels of industry compliance and consumer awareness
of the Rule's provisions. Because the Rule's full impact cannot be gauged, the AARP concluded, repeal is unwarranted.
The AARP further asserted that the evidence indicates that the Rule has not increased funeral providers' costs, funeral
prices, or consumer expenditures, but has begun to provide a variety of consumer benefits. The AARP thus further concluded
that, although the Commission need not meet a specific evidentiary burden to retain the Rule, such evidence exists
to support the conclusion that the Rule's benefits exceed its costs.

2. Costs and Benefits Compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has concluded, based on its review of the rulemaking record viewed as a whole, that the Rule warrants
retention because its actual and potential benefits to consumers outweigh its costs to providers, and that those
benefits are likely to increase over time as the Rule continues to operate. The Commission finds that, at the time of
this review: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Rule has not been effective in the funeral market for a sufficient period to permit a full assessment of its benefits;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The market is increasingly price-sensitive for the selection of funeral providers, types of service, and individual
goods and services, particularly caskets, when price and options information is readily available during the selection
process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Despite a documented, low overall compliance level, pro-competitive and informational benefits attributable
in part to the Rule appear to be manifesting in the market and are likely to increase over time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Rule overall imposes minimal compliance burdens on providers that do not significantly raise their business
costs or prices, or reduce consumers' satisfaction with the funeral services they receive; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Most states have not adopted laws similar to the Rule in scope and coverage, and such action is not likely in the near
future.

a. Levels of compliance/price competition/consumer Awareness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The evidence in the record indicates, at the time of this review, a low level of industry compliance with the Rule. Systematic,
empirical data from two independent surveys_the Commission-sponsored, 1987 Replication Study and the 1988 Gallup
Study conducted for the AARP_show that 36% of funeral providers simultaneously complied with the Rule's two key requirements
to give consumers a general price list (``GPL'') and an itemized final statement of goods and services selected.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 Using the more comprehensive Replication Study results, that overall compliance level dropped to 31% when misrepresentation
provisions about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation are added to the analysis,
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 and to 9% when the GPL timing requirement is viewed strictly and several other Rule provisions are considered.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 Most rulemaking participants opined, when asked, that a 30% level of compliance would be insufficient to assess adequately
the Rule's benefits.

obligations individually, 23% of RS providers gave consumers the GPL_the key price disclosure document required
by the Rule_at the outset of arrangements discussions as required, and 62% gave consumers who purchased a funeral
on an item-by-item basis a properly itemized final statement. See HX&hyph;122 at Table VIII, p.20 and Table X, p.24.

R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 27, Table 8; R&hyph;B&hyph;2 (Replication Study/Market Facts Report) data
tapes. In the BE analysis (HX&hyph;122), RS respondents were considered to have been the beneficiaries of ``compliance''
with respect to receipt of the GPL if they reported its receipt after discussions had begun but before selection of
a casket or other container. BE staff, at the rulemaking staff's request, re-computed the compliance index using
the Rule's definition of when a GPL must be given to consumers _``upon beginning discussion either of funeral arrangements
or of the selection of any funeral goods or funeral services.'' The result was that compliance with four of the Rule's
provisions fell from 31% to 15% (timely receipt of the GPL and a properly-itemized statement, and no misrepresentations
about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation). Overall, simultaneous compliance continued to drop
from a ``high'' of 29% (using the most stringent BE compliance index, which added receipt of the GPL ``in writing''
to the four requirements stated above) to a ``low'' of 9% as other Rule provisions were added to the analysis.

In addition to the relatively low level of overall industry Rule compliance, the rulemaking record demonstrates
that funeral providers have not provided the initial stimulus for ``increased competition'' on the basis of price
considered necessary by the Commission. The few funeral home entrants that aggressively compete on price, documented
in the record, appear to be former, more traditional funeral directors who reentered the market as ``discount'' providers,
and who are considered to be ``mavericks'' by the funeral industry as a whole. More traditional funeral homes, by industry
representatives' own admission, generally do not price advertise or otherwise compete on the basis of price.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 The record further indicates that funeral providers show little support for unfettered competition in the sale of
pre-need funeral services,
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 and that many affirmatively attempt to discourage potential price competition from third-party cemeteries and
other non-funeral home retailers who sell caskets on a pre-need basis, by imposing so-called ``casket handling fees,''
averaging $300&hyph;$500 per funeral on consumers who patronize those sellers.

The testimony of various funeral directors and cemeterians indicates that funeral providers as a group have supported
state 100 percent pre-need ``trusting'' laws. The major impact of a ``100 percent'' trusting requirement_all moneys
received from the consumer for a pre-need purchase must be placed in trust until the time of need_is to leave the pre-need
seller without current funds to pay for the expenses associated with pre-need sales, such as an active sales force.

Finally, the empirical data and record testimony documents that a majority of consumers exhibit low levels of awareness
concerning their rights under the Rule
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 and funeral prices and service options,
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 as a result of a general lack of ``visibility'' of the Rule and of readily-available, comparative price information.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 Other empirical evidence indicates that consumers' ``experience'' with funerals is low by any measure
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 and that, regardless of their level of experience, consumers are not ``familiar'' with the funeral transaction.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 Most rulemaking participants concluded that the documented low levels of overall industry compliance and consumer
knowledge, viewed together, indicate that the Rule has not been in place long enough to adequately assess its impact
on the funeral market.

Although not uncontroverted by the rulemaking staff and funeral industry representatives, the results of two national,
consumer opinion surveys indicated that: (1) When asked whether they were ``familiar with the FTC's Funeral Rule
and what it requires,'' 90 percent of the 782 respondents aged 45 and above surveyed in the first of these ``Excel''
surveys said ``no'' and 10 percent answered ``yes;'' and (2) when asked whether each of several declarative statements
about funeral director obligations and funeral consumer rights was ``required by federal law or not,'' a majority
(54 percent-75 percent) of the 916 consumer-respondents aged 21 and over said that, to the best of their knowledge,
federal law does not require the rights and obligations actually mandated by the Funeral Rule, or said that they do
not know. See McFadden, HX&hyph;8 at 3 and Exhibit B, Table 001; Soulas, HX&hyph;76 at 3. The ``McFadden'' survey results
also provided evidence that older consumers aged 65 or over are significantly less likely to be aware of the Rule's
protections than are younger consumers aged 18&hyph;34. HX&hyph;8 at Exhibit B, tables 002&hyph;004, 006&hyph;007.

Thirty-six percent of the RS respondents reported that they had no prior experience arranging funerals; another
30 percent said that they had participated in planning arrangements once before, and the remaining third said they
had done so twice before or more. R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at III&hyph;9, Table III&hyph;7. Because the RS surveyed recent
funeral arrangers, however, and not the general public, the level of respondents' prior experience may not be representative
of the population as a whole. The Commission found, for example, that, at the time it promulgated the Rule, about 50
percent of the adult population had never arranged a funeral and another quarter had done so only once. See R&hyph;B&hyph;5

The Bureau of Economics staff performed an analysis of the RS data to determine whether there was any link between respondents'
degree of experience in making funeral arrangements (Question 10. of the study) and their level of knowledge about
the funeral transaction (Question 55 asked whether embalming is required by law and whether a sealed casket/vault
preserves remains indefinitely). BE staff divided respondents into two categories_those with arrangements experience
prior to the one surveyed and those without such prior experience. BE staff then performed a statistical test to determine
whether there was any relationship between those two categories and their answers to Question 55. BE staff found no
relationship between the degree of respondents' reported prior experience and their level of knowledge. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1
(SR) at n. 124. In addition to BE's statistical test, the RS results show that 50 percent and 42 percent, respectively,
of the RS respondents, all of whom had arranged a funeral at least once, reported incorrectly that embalming was always
required as a public health measure and that a sealed casket/vault preserves remains for an indefinite time. R&hyph;B&hyph;2

b. Market price-sensitivity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consumers' demand for funerals, of course, is price inelastic. Record evidence indicates, however, that consumers'
selections of individual funeral providers, overall types of funeral service, and individual funeral goods and
services are price-sensitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumers value available price information in selecting a funeral home and in making specific funeral arrangements,
particularly when they receive the price information early in selecting funeral goods and services. With respect
to the selection of a provider, 52% of NSM survey respondents in the years 1983&hyph;1988 said that they considered
price ``very important'' in their funeral home selection, although other factors appeared to be more important;
only 19% considered price unimportant.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, ``low-cost'' funeral homes, where they exist, have increased their business substantially in recent
years as a direct result of their competitive pricing practices.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 Regarding the selection of specific goods and services, many consumers are purchasing competitively-priced caskets
from third-party sellers when they are available,
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 are increasingly choosing the significantly less-expensive cremation alternative,
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 are purchasing significantly fewer caskets and requesting embalming for cremation less frequently than in 1981,
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 and are declining items that used to be included in funeral ``packages.''
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Replication Study consumers who received price information early in the transaction spent $252 less for their specific
arrangements than those who did not get that timely information;
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 the earlier consumers received price information, the more likely they were to consider the information important
to their choices in making funeral arrangements.

The analysis is based on R&hyph;J&hyph;11, NSM Summary sheets, Question 1.f. See also, R&hyph;M&hyph;5 at 7&hyph;8.
The NSM Survey results are remarkably similar to those of the RS concerning the importance of price. That data indicate
that 56% of the survey respondents reported that the cost of funeral arrangements was ``very'' or ``somewhat'' important
in their decision to select the funeral home they used; 15% reported that cost was somewhat or very unimportant. R&hyph;B&hyph;2

The BE analysis showed that cremation selections increased from 11% in 1981 to 14% in 1987, and that the average cremation
cost to 1987 respondents was about one-third of the cost of open-casket funerals ($1,054 vs. $2,818). HX&hyph;122
at Table II, p. 6, Table III, p. 7. BE staff noted that the close similarity of the survey results to cremation statistics
provided by the CANA suggests that the BLS and RS are representative of the national population.

Thirty-four percent of cremation buyers in 1981 also purchased caskets, and 35 percent bought embalming services;
those selections dropped in 1987 to 19% (caskets) and 25% (embalming). R&hyph;B&hyph;3 (BLS) at Table 3, p. 23; R&hyph;B&hyph;2
(RS) at Table III&hyph;44, p. III&hyph;71 (caskets) and Table III&hyph;42, p. III&hyph;67 (embalming). Similarly,
CANA member surveys indicate a reduction in the purchase of caskets for cremation from 22% to 17% between 1983 and 1987,
a reduction which the CANA attributed to the Rule. See Kelsey, Tr. Vol. II, 310&hyph;312, Purdy, Tr. Vol. III, 158.

Seventy-six percent of consumers who received price information ``at the beginning'' of arrangements discussions
said that price information was very or somewhat important; 75% said so when they got price information ``before casket
selection;'' 62% who reported that they received such information ``when finalizing arrangements'' said that it
was very or somewhat important at that time; 67% said so when they got the information ``after decisions had been made;''
and 53% said so when there was ``no discussion of price.'' In the first three periods above, 41%, 31%, and 22% of respondents,
respectively, said that price information was ``very'' important. The analysis is based on consumers' answers to
RS questions 27 (when price information was first received) and 35(c)(5) (importance of price information in arranging
the funeral). R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at APPENDIX: Questionnaire, and data tape. See also, R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal)

c. Pro-competitive/informational benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the 31% overall industry compliance level with four of the Rule's key requirements
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 and the lack of price competition among funeral homes, competitive and informational benefits that are at least partially
attributable to the Rule have begun to manifest in the funeral market. Testimonial evidence establishes that the
Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure provisions have encouraged third-party casket sellers and low-cost
funeral homes to enter the market and have helped them compete,
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 in part because the GPL and telephone disclosure requirements permit non-industry entities to gather and publish
comparative price data.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Many consumers have used that data to select those lower-cost funeral providers and purchase caskets from third-party
sellers where they exist.

Other testimonial evidence presented by the FFDA, which provides financial and accounting services to 1,500 independent
funeral home clients in 30 states, indicates that the Rule_through the availability of the GPL_has raised the industry's
``price consciousness,'' which may be partly responsible for the tempering of price increases in recent years.
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 Mandatory itemization may have helped retard the growth of funeral prices and consumer expenditures, a goal fully
intended by the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 Statistical data provided by the FFDA and the Replication Study, and analyzed by an economist for the AARP and the BE
staff, also establish that, although overall prices and consumer expenditures for funerals increased since 1981
by more than the general price level (the ``CPI&hyph;U''), which includes all goods and services, the increase was
comparable to the increase in service prices (the ``CPI&hyph;US,'' which excludes medical services); that is, compared
to other service industries,
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 funeral prices and expenditures in the period 1981&hyph;1987 did not increase above the rate of inflation.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 In 1988, expenditures and prices for funeral services increased by even less than the rate of inflation for the general
economy (the ``CPI&hyph;U'').

See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 76, 79&hyph;80. Even if overall industry compliance were higher and consumer expenditures
still remained unchanged, the level of expenditures is not the sole test of the Rule's benefits. As the BE staff stated
in its report, expenditures may rise as a result of price increases related to funeral homes' fixed costs that are not
associated with any costs of Rule compliance. The record evidence indicates, in fact, that Rule compliance has not
significantly increased funeral providers' costs or prices, that consumer expenditures and funeral prices, when
compared to other service industries, have not increased above inflation, and that an industry ``price consciousness''
induced by the availability of the GPL may have tempered price increases. If the Rule's only benefit were to increase
informed consumer choice (without imposing substantial costs on industry), regardless of whether some chose to
spend more for their arrangements than they would have without the Rule, that benefit would likely justify retention
of the Rule because other consumers would have the right to choose to spend less. The Commission in its 1982 SBP for the
Rule so stated the Rule's purpose. The record evidence in fact indicates that many consumers will purchase fewer funeral
items or less-expensive services as a result of informed choice.

In addition to these benefits, record evidence discussed above suggests that the Rule has helped increase consumers'
awareness of prices and service options as factors to consider in making funeral purchase decisions. Many consumers
choose low-cost funeral homes and caskets competitively offered by third-party providers, and consumers who chose
cremation in 1987 purchased fewer caskets and embalming than in 1981. Finally, that evidence indicated that consumers
now decline items once included in packaged funerals, and increasingly choose less-expensive cremation alternatives.

Although the record evidence supports the conclusion that the Rule facilitates consumers' choice of cremation,
the degree to which the Rule has affected the cremation rate is unclear from the record evidence. The NFDA suggested
that the Rule has not played an important role in the steadily increasing cremation rate, because the increase began
in the early 1970s and is based primarily on changing social and moral values, as well as on the wishes of the deceased,
and not on price concerns. The CANA and the AARP, in contrast, asserted that the Funeral Rule proceedings, which also
began in the early 1970s, as well as the Rule itself, substantially increased publicity about the cremation alternative,
and that many consumers do choose cremation based on price and other considerations. The CANA also provided evidence
that the marketing of cremation options has dramatically increased since the Rule's inception. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1

Other empirical evidence indicates that, since 1981, the proportion of consumers who receive price information
early in the funeral transaction, and use that information to spend less for their arrangements, has increased by
7%.
<FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>
 Consumer purchases of ``unneeded'' caskets and embalming for cremation have decreased,
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 as have provider misrepresentations about casket requirements,
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 and the accuracy of consumers' knowledge regarding casket for cremation and embalming requirements and the preservative
value of sealed caskets has increased slightly.
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 The great majority of rulemaking participants expressed the view that the actual and potential Rule benefits just
enumerated will tend to increase over time, as compliance with, and consumer awareness of, the Rule increases.

That data show that, in 1981, 18% and 11% of ``direct cremation'' purchasers, respectively, appear to have bought
embalming services and caskets that were unnecessary, because the body is not present during the service (making
embalming unnecessary) and is not buried (making a casket unnecessary). In 1987, those figures declined to 9% (unneeded
embalming) and 2% (unneeded caskets), respectively. See R&hyph;M&hyph;5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 9; R&hyph;B&hyph;2

Record data also indicate that those arguably ``unneeded'' casket purchases occurred in many cases as a result of

Seven percent of those 1987 RS respondents who purchased cremations said that the providers they used represented

did not include a response category permitting the compliant statement that an unfinished wood box (an alternative
container that is arguably a type of casket) was required. Eleven percent of the 1987 RS respondents answered the question

Although not directly related to pro-competitive and informational benefits, other empirical evidence based on
the Replication Study data and BE staff's compliance indices indicates that the proportion of consumers reporting
satisfaction with their arrangements steadily increases as simultaneous provider compliance with the Rule's provisions
increases.

 That evidence indicates that compliance with the Rule benefits consumers and funeral providers by increasing consumer
satisfaction with funeral service, and that the level of satisfaction might continue to increase if compliance with

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Rule has begun to provide benefits to consumers, empirical evidence demonstrates that its requirements
have not been a significant contributing factor to increases in funeral home costs of doing business or funeral home
prices, or to any reduction of overall consumer satisfaction with funeral services. Funeral provider groups, however,
asserted that the Rule has imposed on providers a variety of increased costs, most notably for personnel as a result
of a 23-minute average increase in the duration of the arrangements conference, and for business expenses such as
printing, accounting and legal services. These costs, those groups said, have been passed on to consumers in the form
of higher prices, particularly for professional services.

 and analyzed by an economist for the AARP, indicates that funeral home costs arguably most related to the Rule (such

and casket cost),

Federated Funeral Directors of America (FFDA) processes records from 1,500 funeral home clients in 30 states that
conduct about 181,000 funerals a year, representing just under 10% of all deaths. FFDA is the largest company of its
type in the country. Hahn, Tr. II, 662&hyph;663.

Dr. Barnow, speaking on behalf of the AARP, reported that his review of the FFDA data showed that accounting, consultants
and legal costs were responsible for 2.6% of the real increase in overall funeral home costs since 1981, whereas depreciation
and casket cost respectively accounted for 14.9% and 9.3% of the real increase in costs. See Dr. Barnow, HX&hyph;118
at 14 and Exhibit 2, pp.12&hyph;13. Dr. Barnow further stated that increased compliance would not substantially
increase the Rule's costs, because there are no identifiable, major costs imposed by the Rule now on providers. Tr.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When first proposed, many believed the Funeral Rule would lower funeral and cremation service prices because lower-priced
options would be made known to the consumer. However, when put into effect, the Funeral Rule caused funeral directors
to examine their costs. In doing so, many realized that they had been ``giving away'' some services. In effect, funeral
directors became more business-oriented as a result of the FTC rulings, and found that they could actually raise prices.

Further record analysis of the FFDA statistical data by BE staff indicates that funeral homes' personnel expenses
appear to have increased very slightly since 1984, but that personnel expense as a proportion of overall business
expense has not significantly changed in many years, including the period covered by the Rule. Similar analysis shows
that salary expense as a proportion of personnel cost has likewise remained stable.

e. State Regulation of Funeral Providers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rulemaking record finally documents that most individual states favor the continued existence and strong enforcement
of the Funeral Rule to protect funeral consumers, rather than reliance on the states to adopt comprehensive, state-specific
legislation. A 1987 staff survey of the states' funeral industry statutes, regulations and rules revealed that ten
states have incorporated the Rule by reference into their laws or adopted provisions similar to six of the Rule's most
salient requirements; six have enacted at least four of those provisions, and, overall, thirteen to twenty-five
states have laws that include one or more provisions similar to the Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No party presented evidence during the review that additional states have adopted relevant funeral laws or that existing
laws have been significantly strengthened.

Testimonial evidence presented by state legislators and officials further indicates that, although the Rule has
helped stimulate the enactment of similar funeral industry laws in several states, such reform is unlikely in their
or other states because of industry opposition. Those witnesses expressed their views that the Funeral Rule needs
to be retained as a result, and is beneficial to consumers, funeral providers, and state enforcement officials.

C. Section-by-Section Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule as amended contains two major changes_deletion of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement and
the prohibition of non-declinable fees (such as so-called ``casket handling fees'' and ``basic facilities fees'')
charged in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic professional services of the funeral director and staff.
These primary changes, and a number of ``fine-tuning'' amendments, are intended to increase the Rule's benefits
and reduce its costs by facilitating funeral providers' compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's
requirements, while preserving the integrity of the Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission has made several technical amendments to the Rule that are necessary to correct inconsistencies
or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Affirmative Telephone Disclosure Repeal: Section 453.2(b)(1)(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.2(b)(1)(i) of the original Rule required funeral providers to affirmatively tell persons who call and
ask about the ``terms, conditions, or prices'' at which funeral goods or funeral services are offered that price information
is available over the telephone. The Commission has decided that the affirmative telephone disclosure provision
should be deleted from the Rule because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits to consumers, and because
the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retaining the requirement to provide
price information over the telephone on request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission designed this provision to help consumers in two ways. First, it would alert them to the availability
of price information over the telephone, and, second, it might diminish consumers' reluctance to seek such information.
The Commission intended that affirmative disclosure provision to facilitate consumers' comparison shopping for
a provider.

Empirical evidence presented by the Replication Study, however, indicated that few consumers comparison shop before
selecting a provider. The Commission in the NPR thus requested public comment on whether: (1) Consumers are aware
of their right to seek price information over the telephone; (2) compliance with this provision is costly; and (3)
it should retain the affirmative telephone disclosure provision in view of the study results.

Empirical and testimonial evidence in the record provided insights into the delicate relationship between consumers
and funeral providers that appear to affect the degree to which consumers seek price information directly from providers.
Results from the Baseline, Replication and Gallup Studies indicated that consumers seldom seek price information
or comparison shop by calling providers directly. In 1981, 7.2% of the Baseline Study respondents comparison shopped
by contacting more than one funeral home;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
89
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 4.2% of the 1987 Replication Study respondents did so,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 11% of the 1988 Gallup Study consumers contacted more than one provider.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
91
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most 1987 Replication Study respondents knew which funeral provider they intended to use,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
92
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and those who had not decided on a funeral provider usually contacted only one at the time of need.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

Record evidence indicated that both consumers and providers are reluctant to initiate price discussions during
funeral arrangements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
95
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The evidence indicates that, unlike a visit to the funeral home, where the general price list facilitates the actual
review of services and merchandise, the offer to discuss prices over the telephone is helpful only if the consumer
is prepared to do so. The weight of the evidence demonstrates that the initial telephone contact is a tentative encounter
in which the consumer is relying on the funeral provider to set the tone of the interaction. The funeral provider at
that delicate time, however, reasonably wishes to avoid the appearance of insensitivity by raising price issues
when the callers' typical concerns are whether and how to arrange the funeral with the particular provider.

Several provider witnesses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
96
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 testified that the affirmative telephone disclosure has offended callers, who interpret the disclosure as an indication
of the funeral provider's preoccupation with the consumer's ability to afford services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
97
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For example, a state funeral board member observed that, whenever a client calls first to arrange a date and time for
a funeral service, expecting an empathic response, the consumer is offended by the funeral director's uninvited
statement that price information is available, and the funeral provider resentful about having to make such a statement
at this early juncture.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
98
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other providers distinguished between the accepted practice of giving price information that is requested, and
the difficulty of telling the caller who has not requested it that the funeral provider is prepared to talk about prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
99
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Funeral director representatives concluded that providers' goodwill is harmed as a result of the offense generated
by the unsolicited affirmative disclosure, which providers under the Rule must make during the initial telephone
contact.

during the initial telephone discussion that price information is available was offensive or confusing to consumers.
The Gallup results indicated that most arrangers (83%) are not offended ``when funeral directors give them information
about the cost of funeral services when they first begin making arrangements.'' See Colasanto, HX&hyph;66 at Appendix
B, Tabulations, p. 24. That question, however, refers more specifically to consumers' feelings about actual price
information offered by providers during the arrangements conference, such as providers' offer of the GPL, and not
to consumers' views about the affirmative telephone disclosure that price information is available.

The evidence further shows that providers experience difficulty in understanding their obligation under &sect;453.2
(b)(1)(i). Under that affirmative disclosure provision, a funeral provider must either tell every caller that price
information is available, or determine whether an inquiry concerns a ``term,'' ``condition,'' or ``price'' of funeral
goods or funeral services offered, thus triggering the disclosure. The original staff Compliance Guidelines illustrated
that problem; the Guidelines told funeral providers that a call asking whether the provider will perform a funeral
for a particular religion does not trigger the disclosure, whereas a call asking whether the provider will remove
the deceased from a hospital does.

The Commission, however, has not adopted the AARP-suggested modification that would resolve this compliance problem
by requiring funeral providers to inform all callers that price information is available over the telephone. The
record contains substantial evidence that some consumers would be offended unnecessarily by such unsolicited remarks,
and that substantial harm to funeral providers' reputations could occur, without significant consumer benefit.
These possibilities further may increase the likelihood of non-compliance, which the evidence suggests may be no
greater than 50% at this time. On balance, ensuring that those callers who seek price information can obtain it would
better assist consumers in making informed selections.

Other empirical data indicate that the disclosure does not affect consumers' expenditures for funeral arrangements.
Economic analysis of the Replication Study data indicated that those consumers who called the provider and received
the Rule-required affirmative disclosure spent no less for their arrangements than other respondents.

Consumer group participants, however, suggested that the affirmative disclosure was meant to signal consumers
who are reluctant to raise price issues that it is acceptable to do so, and that providers can find ways to make that disclosure
without offending consumers.

 Although the empirical evidence is not conclusive on the issue, the preponderance of the reliable anecdotal evidence
provided by many funeral directors who must make the disclosure to consumers supports the conclusion that the requirement's
potential to overcome consumers' inhibitions and benefit additional consumers is unlikely, and does not justify
the imposition of awkwardness and potential offense in a transaction already fraught with delicate business, social
and personal issues.

In summary, the record evidence shows that consumers rarely price shop for a funeral home or seek price information
directly from providers because of their reluctance to do so and their general lack of awareness about prices charged
by providers, and not because of a conviction that price information cannot be requested over the telephone. The affirmative
disclosure that price information is available thus does not appear to give consumers new information that is likely
to increase their desire to ask about prices or to encourage price shopping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record evidence further indicates, however, that the Rule overall is contributing to increased consumer ``price
sensitivity'' that leads some additional consumers to use the telephone to shop for lower-cost providers, or to seek
comparative price information from non-industry sources. Consequently, consumers who want price information
will affirmatively use the telephone to seek such information from providers who advertise prices, or to engage in
alternative shopping methods, such as calling memorial societies, media price ``hotlines,'' or state agencies
that make comparative price information available.

The preponderance of the evidence in the rulemaking record indicates that the affirmative telephone disclosure

 Nor does the evidence support a conclusion that industry compliance with the affirmative telephone provision is
too low to permit a conclusion about its potential benefits. The evidence on compliance with &sect;453.2(b)(1)(i)
is inconclusive. The RS data show that about half of all providers (49%) who were asked about funeral ``prices, terms,
or conditions'' over the telephone made the required disclosure. However, an unusually large proportion of the respondents_29%&hyph;31%_could
not recall whether they received the disclosure, and the study contractor warned that the results should be viewed
with extreme caution because of the small cell size (93 respondents called and asked about ``prices, terms, or conditions'').
Excluding from the analysis those who could not recall increases the compliance level to about 72%. See R&hyph;B&hyph;2
(RS) at III&hyph;36, Table III&hyph;26; HX&hyph;122 (BE Report) at 16&hyph;17 (compliance results); R&hyph;B&hyph;2

In light of this evidence, the Commission has determined to repeal the affirmative telephone disclosure provision
because its potential to benefit additional consumers is unlikely, and does not warrant the intrusion of potential
offense in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission further
concludes that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the general
requirement to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request (&sect;453.2(B)(1)).

107

The Commission in its Statement of Basis and Purpose for the Rule clearly expressed its view that the general telephone
requirement to give price information on request, and the requirement to give the GPL to any person seeking in-person
information about funeral arrangements, in addition to the affirmative telephone disclosure, would all contribute
to increased comparison shopping.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nevertheless, the Commission did not base the Rule's entire success in reducing barriers to price competition on
the affirmative telephone disclosure or on comparison shopping, because it fully recognized that such behavior
might always be infrequent.

 As described above, the Rule's provisions already are providing pro-competitive benefits to consumers, including
increased price sensitivity, despite the low overall levels of industry compliance, price competition and consumer
knowledge demonstrated by the record. Those benefits are likely to increase over time as industry compliance with,
and consumer awareness of, the Rule's other provisions increases.

from cemeteries and other third-parties, charge high ``casket handling fees'' for arrangements where consumers
supply their own caskets purchased from those third parties.

The PAA Survey provided empirical evidence on the widespread existence and amount of ``casket handling fees,'' as
reported by the respondent retailers. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said that at least 60% of the funeral
homes in their market area assess handling fees, about two-thirds said that 80% to 100% charge the fees, and one-quarter
reported that all of the homes impose the casket handling fee.

Concerning the amount of ``casket handling fees'' assessed, 81% of the PAA Survey respondents said that the average

 Wendell Hahn of the FFDA, which provides financial advising services to 1,500 providers in 30 states, testified that
handling fees are assessed because providers, who typically charge professional service fees ``hundreds of dollars''
below their true operation cost, will try to recoup those costs that are lost by the third-party casket sale. Mr. Hahn
concluded that handling fees are thus roughly equal to the amount that providers' non-declinable service fees are
underpriced.

See Hahn, FFDA, HX&hyph;49 at 2. The average mark-up in 1988 was $1,338 (average retail casket price) minus $517 (average
wholesale cost), or $821. By definition, a handling fee must be ``high'' if its purpose is to recoup overhead costs
and profit lost on the casket sale.

Several local surveys conducted by individual casket retailers provided further evidence on the range of ``casket
handling fees'' in given market areas. Those surveys found that handling fees ranged from $100 to $700 in Chicago;

six instances among a sampling of funeral home records he reviewed for the month of August 1988 where handling fees
ranging from $75 to $480 were disclosed on providers' GPLs. HX&hyph;49 at 5, Tr. Vol. II, 673, 719&hyph;720. Other

Record evidence indicates that ``casket handling fees'' prevent potential price competition and reduce consumer
choice. Ninety-two percent of the casket seller respondents to the PAA Survey reported that their casket sales have

marketing efforts as a result of those fees.

Casket retailers and others provided evidence that many third-party sellers offer caskets at prices lower than those
charged by funeral homes. About half of the seventeen PAA Survey respondents who answered the survey's price question
said that their price for the ``same or similar'' casket was at least $250 less than funeral home prices in their market
area. About one-quarter said that their prices were between $100 and $250 less, and another quarter said that their
prices were comparable (within $100). See, Radovich, HX&hyph;101 at Ex. B, p. 10. One retailer who commented on the
ANPR reported that a small casket manufacturer in Chicago was selling 90% of its retail caskets on an at-need basis,
charging about half that of Chicago funeral homes_$250 for a cloth-covered casket and $650 for a sealed, metal casket.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proponents of handling fees did not provide evidence to refute that offered by casket retailers and others on the purpose,
prevalence and impact of ``casket handling fees'' on the casket market. Funeral provider representatives, for example,
did not dispute that ``casket handling fees'' are used to recoup profits and overhead costs lost to third-party casket
sales, but defended that purpose on several grounds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
135
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Providers' responses to third-party casket sales arise, the trade groups asserted, due to the industry's long-standing
tradition of recovering much of its overhead costs and profits through the casket mark-up, and not by increasing service
fees; lower service fees allow funeral homes to provide full service funerals, including lower-priced caskets,
to those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. Although providers in recent years have shifted some of that
casket mark-up to service fees, the shift has been very gradual. The industry groups concluded that providers who
lose casket sales to third parties must, as a result, still forego the recovery of much of their costs and profits that
would have been included in the casket sale.

Nor did the NFDA and NSM argue that ``casket handling fees'' are imposed for actual services rendered in ``handling''
consumer-supplied caskets. Many witnesses, including funeral directors, testified that providers incur no additional
labor or insurance costs when third-party sellers provide a casket, and that the actual labor time spent handling
any casket is minimal; the cost for that service is normally included in the non-declinable professional services
fee. See R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 182; Hahn, FFDA, Tr. Vol. II, 692&hyph;693; Bates, NSM Executive Director,

Those groups asserted that the imposition of ``casket handling fees'' is an isolated, non-discriminatory practice
that fairly allocates providers' overhead costs and profits; the purpose of the fee is to obtain from consumers who
buy third-party caskets consumers' proportionate share of providers' costs and profits for rendering the funeral
service. Providers' only alternative to handling fees, the industry groups argued, would be to raise service fees
charged to all consumers, which, in effect, would require regular clients who purchase providers' caskets to subsidize
the funerals of consumers who purchase their caskets elsewhere_by paying the mark-up on the casket as well as the higher
service fee that would result from other consumers supplying their own caskets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those groups further asserted that handling fees are not assessed for ship-ins, outer burial container sales traditionally
lost to competing cemeteries, or for direct cremation/immediate burials where the consumer supplies the alternative
container because, unlike the unexpected loss of a casket sale to a third-party seller, providers set prices for those
services with the knowledge that they will not make a sale in those cases. Finally, the funeral groups concluded that
the amount of ``casket handling fees'' is sufficiently regulated by the market, because providers that charge unreasonably
high fees will offend consumers and lose market share.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has concluded that substantial ``casket handling fees'' are imposed on consumers by a significant
proportion of providers wherever third-party casket sellers exist, and, as a result, frustrate the Rule's ``unbundling''
requirements and result in the reduction of potential competition in the sale of caskets fostered by the Funeral Rule.

 Others may use handling fees as a direct response to third-party competition. In either case, the issue to be determined
in this proceeding was whether the Rule should allow providers to condition a consumer's right under the Rule to obtain
a funeral service with a consumer-supplied casket upon the payment of a non-declinable fee, charged in addition to
the basic professional services fee (already permitted under the Rule to be non-declinable), or whether the Rule
should require providers to recoup costs and profits lost to third-party casket sales in ways that do not violate the
intent of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision. For example, providers under the Rule may recoup any unallocated
costs or profits lost to third-party casket sales in the non-declinable professional services fee permitted by &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).
The Commission has determined that the latter course is warranted to affirm the Rule's intent to increase consumer
choice and reduce barriers to price competition.

The Commission disagrees with arguments made by funeral provider groups during the proceeding that regulation of
handling fees would amount to ``price regulation.'' The primary issue is the propriety of the handling fee cost and
profit adjustment, through the imposition of a separate, non-declinable fee charged in addition to the non-declinable
fee for ``services of funeral director and staff,'' and not the amount of the handling fee.

Section 453.4(b) of the Funeral Rule was intended to address all ``bundling'' arrangements imposed on consumers
by funeral providers. Under that provision, consumers have the right to decline the purchase of any item, including
a casket, from a funeral provider, and may elect to supply their own. That right, however, is illusory if funeral providers
can condition consumers' choice on the payment of an additional, non-declinable fee. The fee, in any amount, penalizes
consumers for exercising their choice afforded by the Rule.

Section 453.4(b)(2)(ii) of the Rule permits providers to refuse a request for goods and services that would be ``impossible,
impractical, or excessively burdensome'' to provide. That provision, however, does not permit a funeral provider
to refuse service to a consumer because the consumer supplied the casket. See, e.g., Staff Opinion Letter to George
W. Lemke, Executive Director, Casket Manufacturers Association of America (March 18, 1985), FTC File No. 215&hyph;46,

``Casket handling fees'' require consumers to pay two substantial mark-ups, one on the casket they purchase from
the third-party seller, and another on the casket they did not buy from the funeral provider. The evidence indicates
that handling fees average between $300 and $500, and often are higher. That burden, the evidence shows, effectively
removes consumers' economic incentive to purchase a casket from anyone but the funeral provider. Casket sales by
third parties have declined as a result, and several retailers have curtailed their marketing efforts or withdrawn
from the market. Handling fees thus frustrate the purpose of the Funeral Rule_to ensure informed consumer choice
and foster a competitive funeral market. The Commission thus concludes that casket handling fees are unfair conditions
on a consumer's right to decline unwanted items he or she may wish to purchase elsewhere, in violation of section 5 of
the FTC Act, and the spirit of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision (&sect;453.4(b)).

 Conditioning the furnishing of any funeral good or service upon the payment of a so-called ``casket handling fee,''
or any other non-declinable fee not otherwise permitted by the Rule, is an unfair practice for the same reasons articulated
by the Commission in declaring ``package-only'' pricing unfair when it promulgated the Funeral Rule and its general
``unbundling'' section_453.4(b) (the practice is prevalent and imposes substantial and unavoidable injury on
consumers). See R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42269&hyph;71.

Section 453.4(b), however, does not specifically address the practice of conditioning the furnishing of any funeral
goods or services on the payment of fees, such as ``casket handling'' fees, because those fees have developed since
the Rule's implementation, and because they are not conditioned charges for ``goods'' or ``services''_the conditioned
products referred to in that provision. The Commission thus has concluded that so-called ``casket handling'' fees,
and other non-declinable fees that are more aptly referred to as ``recovery of overhead and profit'' fees, need to
be separately addressed in the Rule.

 The Commission prohibits fees that are similar in purpose to ``casket handling fees'' in its Advertising of Ophthalmic
Goods and Services Trade Regulation Rule, 16 CFR Part 456. That Rule requires eye doctors to give consumers a copy of
their eyeglass prescription, so that consumers can shop for eyeglasses. Section 456.7(c) of that Rule further prohibits
eye doctors from charging consumers a fee ``as a condition for releasing the prescription,'' other than the examination
fee. The section thus prevents eye doctors from charging a fee for goods and services not provided that, in effect,
would penalize consumers who wish to comparison shop for ophthalmic goods. Like the non-declinable ``casket handling
fee,'' the conditional fee prohibited by this Ophthalmic Goods and Services Rule frustrates a consumer's right under
the Rule to exercise free choice.

The Commission recognizes the legitimate desire and expectation of funeral industry members to recover overhead
costs and realize a profit. The Rule, however, permits consumers to select and buy only the items wanted unless state
or local law require otherwise. The Funeral Rule is designed to permit funeral providers to have one non-declinable
fee to recover general overhead costs_the fee for the basic services of funeral director and staff. Permitting funeral
providers to have additional surcharges, whether they are called ``casket handling fees,'' or something else, would
frustrate the Rule's aim to promote full itemization and informed consumer choice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent that result and clarify the current requirements of the Rule, the Commission has added paragraph (b)(1)(ii)
to &sect;453.4 of the Rule. That amendment prohibits as an unfair or deceptive act or practice the furnishing of funeral
goods or services upon payment of any conditional ``fees'' not otherwise permitted by the Rule. The amendment, however,
permits funeral providers to recover overhead in the two ways permitted by the original Rule_by marking up the items
offered for sale to the public, and by having the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director and staff,
permitted by &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A) of the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also has amended &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)(2) of the Rule to require, among other things, disclosure
of: (1) The dollar amount charged for any non-declinable basic professional services when that charge is included
in the price of the provider's caskets; and (2) the statement ``This same fee shall be added to the total cost of your
funeral arrangements if you provide the casket.'' These amendments are intended to have the same effect as the amendment
to &sect;453.4(b) above_they prohibit funeral providers (who choose not to itemize the charge for basic professional
services) from charging consumers who purchase caskets from third parties a non-declinable fee for recovery of overhead
and profit in addition to the professional services fee charged to all customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These two amendments are not intended to impede funeral providers from recovering overhead costs and earning profits
from their operations. Efficient providers can structure their prices charged to all consumers to recover the revenue
lost to third-party casket (or other merchandise) sales. The evidence indicates that providers for many years have
so adjusted their pricing structure to account for consumer-supplied caskets (in ship-in cases), outer burial containers,
and alternative containers.

Providers asserted that the impact of a ban on imposing separate, non-declinable casket handling fees, in addition
to the non-declinable professional services fee, would be increased professional service fees to all consumers.
The funeral provider industry made the same argument in the original proceeding regarding the effect of consumer
declinations caused by Rule-required itemization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
143
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the Commission reasoned at that time, providers under the Rule can set or shift prices as they wish, but the long-term
competitive impact of the Rule's price availability provisions might not permit providers to recover lost revenue
from casket declinations simply by raising professional service fees. In the short-term, some consumers might spend
more and some less than they would without the right to decline if providers actually raise service fees in order to
recoup revenue lost to third-party casket sales. As discussed earlier, however, the evidence in this proceeding
indicates that, although service fees generally are underpriced by roughly the average handling fee amount, providers
are reluctant to raise service fees even under current competitive conditions. In any event, the evidence indicates
that the impact of a ban on handling fees would more likely be increased competition in the sale of caskets, and, in turn,
an overall reduction in casket prices over time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.2(b)(4) of the Rule required providers to give for retention a General Price List to persons who inquire
in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services. The GPL must contain, among other
things, several disclosures about consumers' right to select only those items they desire and the retail prices for
17 specified items, if offered for sale. Providers under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i) of the original Rule were required
to offer the GPL ``

upon beginning discussion either of funeral arrangements or of the selection of any funeral goods or funeral services.''

Many funeral providers, however, erroneously believe that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation of preliminary
arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. That misinterpretation leads
them to offer the GPL at arguably inappropriate times, such as during preliminary discussions of death certificates
or veterans benefits, or, in the case of an out-of-town death, the location of the deceased.

The Commission has determined, however, that the preponderance of the evidence does not warrant the sweeping amendments
to, or repeal of, &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i) as proposed by funeral provider groups. The Commission draws that conclusion
particularly in light of the empirical evidence on the level of providers' compliance with the current GPL requirements
(23% give the GPL at the outset of arrangements discussions), and the evidence that consumers want price and options
information about funeral goods and services and value price information that they receive early in the funeral transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is persuaded by that compliance evidence, however, that some fine-tuning is necessary to clarify
the Rule and promote increased compliance, thereby enhancing the Rule's opportunity to provide benefits to consumers.
The amendment discussed below thus is intended to remove any ambiguities and unnecessary rigidity in &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i)
that appear to cause funeral directors to misinterpret their obligations under that provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provider group proposals would have unacceptably narrowed the circumstances in which providers would be required
to provide a GPL to consumers. First, the suggestion that providers ``make available'' a GPL might have been tantamount
to effective repeal of the entire GPL requirement if such language means something other than physically giving the
GPL to consumers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
147
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consumers might receive no GPL disclosures about funeral service prices or options, or concerning their rights in
the funeral transaction under the Rule or other laws, unless they asked to see the GPL and providers voluntarily complied
with their request. Such a change is not warranted, given record evidence on relatively low, overall levels of Rule
compliance. Other evidence_that consumers are reluctant to raise price issues after the death of a loved one, that
consumers, nonetheless, desire price and service options information, and that consumers benefit from price information
they receive early in the funeral transaction_also supports this conclusion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the NFDA suggestion that providers need only give a GPL to persons who inquire in person about the ``price''
of funeral goods or services would eliminate the obligation to give a GPL to those who ask about prices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``funeral arrangements.'' In light of the evidence just mentioned, this proposed narrowing of the GPL distribution
requirement is not supported by the record. Although one of the Rule's goals is to increase price competition, and,
in turn, reduce overall consumer expenditures, the Commission also intended the provision of itemized price information
to alert consumers to their various options and to permit them to select only those items they desire, whether or not
expenses would be reduced as a result.

Virtually every funeral director who advocated a change in the GPL timing requirements expressed concern about when
in the arrangements discussions might be the sensitively correct time to discuss ``price'' with consumers. None
spoke of the correct time to provide or discuss information about funeral service ``options'' and their relative
cost. The record evidence, however, suggested that because price issues may not specifically arise early in the transaction,
due to mutual provider and consumer reluctance, consumers may choose particular types of arrangements, or specific
items, without the benefit of information about the available alternatives unless they receive a timely GPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, the NFDA proposal that providers make the GPL available at the funeral arrangements conference before ``specific''
funeral goods and services are selected or prices discussed would remove the requirement that providers give the
list at the beginning of arrangements discussions, wherever they take place. Record evidence shows that consumers
benefit from price and service options information, including the GPL, that they receive early in selecting funeral
goods and services, and that at least some funeral arrangements, short of a formal ``arrangements conference,''
often can and do occur away from the funeral home premises.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
149
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other evidence discussed earlier demonstrated that consumers' knowledge generally about the funeral transaction,
although somewhat improved, is still relatively low. As a result of adopting the NFDA suggestion, consumers' opinions
about the overall type of funeral service or individual items could thus be formed, or actual selections made, without
the benefit of the GPL disclosures concerning prices, options and consumer rights under the Rule. In that event, the
preponderance of the record evidence supports the conclusion that the GPL's purpose to provide ready price and service
options information for consultation while consumers are considering what goods to purchase, before they make selections,
would be unnecessarily defeated.

Finally, the NFDA-NSM proposal that the GPL's ``give for retention'' requirement be changed so that only consumers

Record evidence indicates that consumers may increase their comparison shopping before selecting a funeral provider
as the marketing of pre-need funeral services increases, because the time constraints surrounding at-need arrangements
are not present to the same degree. See, e.g., Neel, R&hyph;E&hyph;1 at 3.

The Commission has amended &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i) to effect two changes to its original, preventive requirements.
This amendment remedies providers' stated concerns about the timing of the GPL without limiting consumers' ability
to use the information provided by GPL disclosures effectively. First, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``timing''
requirements by breaking down the triggering term ``funeral arrangements'' into its component parts, namely, discussions
of prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific funeral goods or services. This change
should eliminate the apparent provider misinterpretation that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation
of preliminary arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. It clarifies, however,
that discussions about the overall type of service trigger the GPL requirement, and that providers must give the GPL
at the beginning of any discussion involving prices, the overall type of funeral service or disposition, or specific
funeral goods or services.

Record evidence indicates that some providers have construed the term ``selection'' in the original provision to
mean choosing individual items, such as the casket or vault. See, e.g., F. Hunter, Tr. Vol. I, 801 (``as long as before
they sign the contract, before they look at the caskets and select the vault and the exact kind of funeral''); J. Hunter,
Tr. Vol. III, 604&hyph;605 (``after we have discussed some basic funeral plans, when the arranger has determined
a feel for the families' wishes and desires, and prior to the selection of any services and/or goods''); Pierson, R-G&hyph;1
at 2&hyph;3; Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 402; Franzen, Tr. Vol. II, 818). Other providers are reluctant to discuss the GPL
until price issues are raised. See, e.g., Hocker, Tr. Vol. III, 1435; Johnson, Tr. Vol. I, 744; Starks, Tr. Vol. II,
402&hyph;403; and Hennessy, Tr. Vol. II, 1024.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the amendment clarifies the GPL ``distribution'' requirement contained in an original compliance guidelines
interpretation that requires that providers must give consumers the GPL whether discussions occur in the funeral
home ``or elsewhere.'' Record evidence shows that arrangements may occur away from the funeral home premises. However,
the amendment exempts from the GPL requirement in-person provider requests for prior embalming authorization if
the provider makes essentially the same GPL disclosure required by &sect;453.3(a)(1)(ii) of the Rule concerning
the legal necessity for embalming.

Record evidence indicates that providers often may be placed in the uncomfortable position of responding to consumers'
requests to discuss selections during removal of remains. If providers are willing to commit consumers to financial
obligations at that time by making arrangements, record evidence supports consumers' right to receive a GPL. Record
evidence also shows, however, that giving the GPL during removal may be awkward, offensive, and unnecessary if no
other arrangements discussions occur at that time. Such evidence further indicates that a provider's request for
prior embalming authorization, by itself, may be the most potentially offensive situation for both consumers and
funeral directors, because it is a request to perform an intrusive procedure so soon after the survivors' loss.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original and amended Rule resolve this issue for embalming requests made over the telephone by not requiring any
disclosure in that case. But the original Rule required that the GPL must be given if the request is made in person.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If no other selections are made when the provider seeks prior permission, arguably the most important information
consumers need to make an informed response at that time concerns whether embalming is necessary. The required disclosure
that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases should trigger that discussion if the consumer
so desires. The Rule's embalming provisions are predicated on that basis. The amendment simply substitutes the disclosure
of that information for the provision of the entire GPL, to reduce the burden on providers and consumers and to promote
compliance with the Rule. Under the amendment, providers would be in compliance if they either provided a GPL when
seeking prior permission, or made the required embalming disclosure.

5. Fees for Basic (Non-declinable) vs. Other Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.4(b) of the Rule imposes the general legal requirement that consumers' selection of funeral goods and
services be permitted on an itemized basis. However, &sect;453.4(b)(2)(i)(A) permits an exception to that general
right to select. Under that provision, consumers may not decline the basic services of the funeral provider if the
provider so requires. The provision in that event further requires that providers place on the GPL the following statement:
``However, any funeral arrangements you select will include a charge for our services.'' Providers under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)
must also place the following disclosure on the GPL in conjunction with the price for the services of funeral director
and staff, if the fee cannot be declined: ``This fee for our services will be added to the total cost of the funeral arrangements
you select. (This fee is already included in our charge for direct cremations, immediate burials, and forwarding
or receiving remains.)'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, in promulgating that exception, reasoned that the process of selection itself involves use of the
provider's services, irrespective of the actual goods and services chosen by consumers. The Commission thus permitted
providers to make the services of the funeral provider non-declinable.

The Commission also intended that the non-declinable fee for professional services would include only the charge
for providers' basic services in arranging and planning the funeral, and not charges for services associated with
providing any of the other sixteen items for which itemization is required on the GPL.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
158
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

could not decline under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (the GPL service fee disclosure requirement).

The Commission, however, did not codify in the Rule its intent regarding basic services other than in the definition.
No substantive Rule provision thus clarifies that providers in disclosing itemized fees on the GPL must separate
``basic,'' non-declinable services from services associated with providing the other, declinable GPL goods and
services, including such items as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' and ``use of facilities for funeral ceremony.''
The original staff compliance guidelines for the Rule, as a result, contained lengthy interpretations of the Rule
on that issue, concluding that the non-declinable fee for ``services of funeral director and staff'' may not include
a charge for those services involved in providing any of the other items required to be separately listed on the GPL.
Charges for those services, the Guidelines stated, must be included in the price for each of those items. The Guidelines
further concluded that the non-declinable fee for services may include the services listed in the Rule's definition
of ``services of funeral director and staff.''

 Several public hearing witnesses expressed their view, however, that the original disclosure requirement for the
non-declinable services fee permitted the inclusion of service items that all consumers do not receive with their
arrangements, so that consumers may be paying for services not received,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

impractical or excessively burdensome'' to provide may result in ``non-declinable'' charges under certain conditions.
Generally, however, those items are not considered ``non-declinable'' in the sense that consumers, at the outset
of planning arrangements, have no choice but to purchase them.

Still other witnesses identified another problem with the original services fee disclosure. Those participants

providers in fact appear to include different items in their service fee charges. Price comparison among funeral

 Similarly, Wendell Hahn of the FFDA asserted that providers' inclusion of the cost of providing a special-purpose

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evidence indicates that some providers on their GPLs may not be fully separating non-declinable services from
services associated with providing other items on the GPL. To the extent that is occurring, consumers who decline
other items may be purchasing more services than they actually receive. Other consumers may be ``double charged''
for some services if providers, confused about which services are declinable and which are not, include some portion
of the services associated with declinable items, such as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' in that charge, as well
as the non-declinable services fee. Still other consumers (or groups such as memorial societies that obtain and publish
comparative price data) who attempt to comparison shop may not readily be able to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has concluded that the service disclosure requirements need to be clarified to implement fully the
Commission's intent in permitting a non-declinable services fee. Amendment of the Rule, however, to permit a non-declinable
``basic facilities fee'' charge is not warranted by the evidence or the original Rule requirements. The Rule's core
purpose is to permit itemization so that consumers may select only the funeral items they desire, and decline unwanted
items. The Rule allows providers to recover overhead for facilities by allocating a portion of those costs to each
item offered or by including them in the non-declinable services fee. A second, non-declinable fee would signal a
return to package pricing, where all consumers would pay for the use of all facilities (and, presumably, other overhead
costs) irrespective of the degree to which consumers choose to use them. Itemization permits consumers to decline
the use of various provider facilities. The testimony of at least one funeral director suggested, however, that some
providers currently may be imposing in some form a ``non-declinable'' facilities fee on consumers, in apparent violation
of the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has adopted the following amendments to clarify the Rule's intent and requirements
with respect to service fees and non-declinable charges: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Revision of the ``services of funeral director and staff'' definition in &sect;453.1(o) to clarify that these
are the basic services that cannot be included in prices of other, declinable GPL categories, and that are furnished
by a funeral provider in arranging any funeral, such as conducting the arrangements conference, planning the funeral,
obtaining necessary permits, and placing obituary notices; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Addition of the term ``basic'' before the word ``services'' where the latter term appears in &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C)
(1) and (2) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A), so that all GPL disclosures regarding the non-declinable services fee refer to
``basic services'' rather than simply ``services''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Addition of the phrase ``and staff'' after the phrase ``use of facilities'' to &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4) (H) and
(I), to clarify that providers are required to disclose the prices for use of facilities and the services of staff associated
with viewing and a funeral ceremony; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Replacement of the ``other use of facilities'' price disclosure requirement, &sect;453.2(b)(4)(J), with the
more specific disclosures ``use of facilities and staff for memorial service'' and ``use of equipment and staff for
graveside service''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Addition to &sect;453.1 of the definitions of a ``memorial service'' and a ``funeral ceremony'' to distinguish
those services for purposes of listing them separately on the GPL; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Addition of the express requirement to the disclosure requirements of &sect;&sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (1)
and (2) that, if the services fee cannot be declined, it must include all charges for the recovery of unallocated funeral
provider overhead, and funeral providers may include in the required disclosure (and in the GPL disclosure required
by 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A)) the phrase ``and overhead'' after the word ``services,'' so that disclosures regarding non-declinable
services fees refer to ``basic services,'' and to ``basic services and overhead,'' if providers wish; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Addition of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) to &sect;453.2 to make clear that the Rule permits only one non-declinable fee
for services, facilities or unallocated overhead, unless otherwise required by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments clarify the Commission's intent and providers' obligations in distinguishing non-declinable
service fees from other service charges associated with providing separately listed, declinable goods and services.
The changes are designed to promote industry compliance and consumer understanding of the services they must purchase
and those they may decline, without substantially altering providers' obligations. The amendment permitting providers
to add the phrase ``and overhead'' to the non-declinable service fee disclosure responds to industry's stated concern
that consumers may be deceived by service fee price disclosures that fail to disclose a charge for overhead,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
171
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and clarifies for providers that the non-declinable fee can include overhead not allocated to other charges.

fees include a charge for overhead. Providers may do so under this amendment. See, e.g., P&hyph;37 (NFDA/NSM) at 240&hyph;242;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
173
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the required GPL listing; (2) delete as unnecessary the required GPL disclosure that the GPL does not include
cash advance items, &sect;453.2(b)(4)(i)(D), and move from the GPL to the statement of goods and services selected
the cash advance mark-up disclosure required by &sect;453.3(f)(2);

174
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) decline to adopt the required use of a ``standardized general price list,'' which the Commission finds is unnecessary
in light of the relatively standardized GPL the Rule now requires, and the amendment, discussed below, prohibiting
any language in any of the Rule-required price lists that alters or contradicts the information provided therein.

 To the extent that the Rule's listing provision has caused providers to charge for acknowledgment cards that were
previously provided free of charge, as funeral provider groups suggested, the Rule may have had the unintended result
of contributing, at least in some small sense, to increased consumer costs. To the extent that the costs are recouped
elsewhere, those costs appear to be so incidental as to be tangential to the Rule's primary purpose. In either case,
the benefits of requiring acknowledgment cards on the GPL appear to be outweighed by the harm to funeral providers'
reputations and consumer satisfaction. The Commission thus has concluded that the better course is to remove the
provision from the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no record evidence to support, however, a general right for the provider to list any of the other items now required
to be on the GPL as ``no charge'' items, as industry groups suggested. The Commission is concerned, for example, that
if the Rule were to permit the listing of embalming or transportation as ``no charge'' items, their costs, which can
amount to several hundreds of dollars, would be recovered in the prices of other items. As a result, consumers would,
in effect, not have the opportunity to decline the costs associated with important items. Such a change could thus
result in the diminution of itemization and the return of package-only pricing, which the Rule was primarily designed
to prevent. See the discussion at R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR), 172&hyph;173.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 453.3 of the Rule currently requires funeral providers to make specific written disclosures on the price
lists and the itemized statement of goods and services selected. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and
Purpose determined that, due to funeral providers' false claims or failure to disclose accurate information, many
consumers erroneously believed that certain procedures (such as embalming) or particular goods (such as caskets
for cremation and outer burial containers) were required purchases not subject to individual choice, and that goods
and services had certain protective and preservative qualities when such was not the case.

R-B&hyph;5 at 42274&hyph;42279. Although the record did not contain evidence that certain misrepresentations
(such as the protective and preservative claims of goods and the requirement of a casket for cremation) were widespread,
the Commission determined that their inclusion in the Rule was necessary because of their pernicious nature, or because
of the substantial, potential cost that could be incurred by consumers who make purchase decisions based upon incorrect
assumptions of material facts. Id. at 42276&hyph;42278.

Section 453.3 thus declares that it is a deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to misrepresent: embalming
requirements, casket for cremation requirements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
177
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 outer burial container requirements, legal and cemetery requirements, preservative and protective value of funeral
goods and services, and cash advance charges. The provisions of &sect;453.3 were designed to prevent those deceptive
practices and to correct consumers' misconceptions by requiring written disclosures on both the price lists and
the itemized statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has determined, however, that the record does not provide a substantial basis to repeal the twelve
affirmative disclosures. Although the empirical data indicate that consumers' knowledge has increased somewhat
under the Rule, and that some misrepresentations have declined, the data also show that misrepresentations are still
occurring, particularly in areas where consumer knowledge is still low, such as embalming. The evidence further
demonstrates that consumer knowledge of funeral requirements and products is still at a minimal level. Viewed together,
those facts warrant the retention of the disclosure provisions.

 Nor is there sufficient evidence to warrant an amendment allowing funeral providers to use their own disclosure language.

that they may only be charged for those items selected or for items that are required by law. If purchases are required
by law or otherwise, this provision further provides consumers with an explanation in writing, together with the
reason the requirement applies to their selections. The provision was intended to provide consumers with a final
reminder that they need only pay for items that they have selected.

use of such price information by making a decision to decline items which they do not wish to purchase.'').

The Commission has amended the required language in order to clarify for consumers the original purpose of the provision.
It alerts consumers that they may only be charged for the goods and services that they choose, or that are required by
law or by a cemetery or crematory (such as an outer burial container or a certain type of alternative container).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission further adopts a technical change to &sect;453.6 concerning providers' retention of documents,
to clarify its requirements. The original section required the funeral provider to retain a copy of the ``signed''
statement of goods and services selected. The Rule, however, does not contain any express requirement that the final
statement be signed, either by the consumer or the provider. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose
made no mention of the signature requirement. Earlier drafts of the Rule included a requirement that the funeral provider
ask the consumer to sign the itemized statement, but it was not adopted in the final version. The ``signed'' language
of &sect;453.6 was apparently inserted to complement the earlier draft of the Rule that contained the itemized statement
requirement; however, when the signature requirement was deleted, the language of &sect;453.6 was inadvertently
left intact. This language, however, is susceptible to different interpretations, and may lead some funeral providers
to believe that they must obtain the signature of the consumer on the statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission therefore has amended the language of &sect;453.6 by deleting the phrase ``on which the statement
was signed,'' and substituting the phrase ``of the arrangements conference,'' so that the provision now requires
providers to maintain a copy of each statement of funeral goods and services selected ``for at least one year from the
date of the arrangements conference.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in addition, has added clarifying language to the required ``clear and conspicuous'' disclosure
standard contained in &sect;453.7 of the Rule. That language clarifies that providers may not add statements or information
to the Rule-required price lists that alter or contradict the information required to be included in those lists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This specific prohibition is necessary to prevent violations of the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard that relate
to provider detraction and potential consumer confusion problems demonstrated in the record.

Finally, the Commission has: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Deleted the definition of ``Accounting year'' (&sect;453.1(a)), because that phrase does not appear elsewhere
in the Rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) amended the definition of a ``casket'' (&sect;453.1(d)), to include those constructed of ``fiberglass'' and
``plastic'', because those types of caskets represent a significant portion of caskets produced in today's market;

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) made a slight grammatical change to the definition of ``Funeral services'' (&sect;453.1(j)), to make it clear
that the Rule only covers services that involve both the preparation of remains and the supervision of disposition.

A. Final Regulatory and Regulatory Flexibility Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined that these amendments to the Funeral Rule will not have an annual effect on the national
economy of $100 million or more, or otherwise have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business.
The preponderance of the evidence in the record indicates that the Rule overall has not significantly increased funeral
providers' costs of doing business, and that the amendments will reduce any costs to providers imposed by the Rule's
requirements, by making it easier for them to comply. Therefore, pursuant to the exception for Rule amendments contained
in section 22(a)(1)(A) of the FTC Act, and the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604, 605, section
22 of the Act requiring that the Commission issue a final regulatory analysis with the promulgation of a final rule
does not apply to this amended Rule.

In selling or offering to sell funeral goods or funeral services to the public, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice
for a funeral provider to fail to furnish accurate price information disclosing the cost to the purchaser for each
of the specific funeral goods and funeral services used in connection with the disposition of deceased human bodies,
including at least the price of embalming, transportation of remains, use of facilities, caskets, outer burial containers,
immediate burials, or direct cremations, to persons inquiring about the purchase of funerals. Any funeral provider
who complies with the preventive requirements in paragraph (b) of this section is not engaged in the unfair or deceptive
acts or practices defined here.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as well as the unfair or deceptive acts or practices defined
in &sect;453.4(b)(1), funeral providers must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Telephone price disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tell persons who ask by telephone about the funeral provider's offerings or prices any accurate information from
the price lists described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section and any other readily available information
that reasonably answers the question.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Give a printed or typewritten price list to people who inquire in person about the offerings or prices of caskets
or alternative containers. The funeral provider must offer the list upon beginning discussion of, but in any event
before showing caskets. The list must contain at least the retail prices of all caskets and alternative containers
offered which do not require special ordering, enough information to identify each, and the effective date for the
price list. In lieu of a written list, other formats, such as notebooks, brochures, or charts may be used if they contain
the same information as would the printed or typewritten list, and display it in a clear and conspicuous manner. Provided,
however, that funeral providers do not have to make a casket price list available if the funeral providers place on
the general price list, specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the information required by this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Place on the list, however produced, the name of the funeral provider's place of business and a caption describing

special ordering, enough information to identify each container, and the effective date for the prices listed. In
lieu of a written list, the funeral provider may use other formats, such as notebooks, brochures, or charts, if they
contain the same information as the printed or typewritten list, and display it in a clear and conspicuous manner.
Provided, however, that funeral providers do not have to make an outer burial container price list available if the
funeral providers place on the general price list, specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the information
required by this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i)(A) Give a printed or typewritten price list for retention to persons who inquire in person about the funeral goods,
funeral services or prices of funeral goods or services offered by the funeral provider. The funeral provider must
give the list upon beginning discussion of any of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Specific funeral goods or funeral services offered by the funeral provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The requirement in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section applies whether the discussion takes place in the funeral
home or elsewhere. Provided, however, that when the deceased is removed for transportation to the funeral home, an
in-person request at that time for authorization to embalm, required by &sect;453.5(a)(2), does not, by itself,
trigger the requirement to offer the general price list if the provider in seeking prior embalming approval discloses
that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases, if any. Any other discussion during that time
about prices or the selection of funeral goods or services triggers the requirement under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)
of this section to give consumers a general price list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) State or local law or regulation requires embalming in the particular circumstances regardless of any funeral
choice which the family might make; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Prior approval for embalming (expressly so described) has been obtained from a family member or other authorized
person; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The funeral provider is unable to contact a family member or other authorized person after exercising due diligence,
has no reason to believe the family does not want embalming performed, and obtains subsequent approval for embalming
already performed (expressly so described). In seeking approval, the funeral provider must disclose that a fee will
be charged if the family selects a funeral which requires embalming, such as a funeral with viewing, and that no fee
will be charged if the family selects a service which does not require embalming, such as direct cremation or immediate
burial.

To prevent these unfair or deceptive acts or practices, funeral providers must include on the itemized statement
of funeral goods and services selected, required by &sect;453.2(b)(5), the statement: ``If you selected a funeral
that may require embalming, such as a funeral with viewing, you may have to pay for embalming. You do not have to pay for
embalming you did not approve if you selected arrangements such as a direct cremation or immediate burial. If we charged
for embalming, we will explain why below.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent the unfair or deceptive acts or practices specified in &sect;453.2 through &sect;453.5, funeral providers
must make all disclosures required by those sections in a clear and conspicuous manner. Providers shall not include
in the casket, outer burial container, and general price lists, required by

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as otherwise provided in &sect;453.2(a), it is a violation of this rule to engage in any unfair or deceptive
acts or practices specified in this rule, or to fail to comply with any of the preventive requirements specified in
this rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The provisions of this rule are separate and severable from one another. If any provision is determined to be invalid,
it is the Commission's intention that the remaining provisions shall continue in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This rule shall not apply to the business of insurance or to acts in the conduct thereof.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If, upon application to the Commission by an appropriate state agency, the Commission determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) There is a state requirement in effect which applies to any transaction to which this rule applies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) That state requirement affords an overall level of protection to consumers which is as great as, or greater than,
the protection afforded by this rule; then the Commission's rule will not be in effect in that state to the extent specified
by the Commission in its determination, for as long as the State administers and enforces effectively the state requirement.
