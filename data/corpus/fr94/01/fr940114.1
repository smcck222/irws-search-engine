SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 102 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 provides that no State shall provide for
(and no person shall collect, directly or indirectly) a greater allowance for the processing of milk (``make allowance'')
than is permitted under a Federal program to establish a Grade A price for manufacturing butter, nonfat dry milk, or
cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 1, 1993, a supplemental proposed rule was published to implement section 102. A supplemental proposed
rule was deemed necessary because of (1) comments received on the original proposed rule published on June 19, 1992,
and (2) regulations issued by the Agricultural Marketing Service concerning the pricing of milk used to produce nonfat
dry milk after the publication of the original proposed rule for section 102. The supplemental proposed rule specified
that all comments had to be received by January 31, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests have been received from interested parties who indicate that they need additional time to prepare an analysis
of the supplemental proposed rule. Based upon our review of those requests, it has been determined that an additional
60 days will be allowed for comment. Accordingly, comments on the proposed rule must now be received by April 1, 1994,
in order to be assured of consideration.

Summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its direct operating (OL), farm ownership (FO), soil and
water (SW) and emergency (EM) loan making and servicing regulations to modify collateral requirements. These amendments
concern the amount of collateral required when an FmHA loan is made. There will be no change in security requirements
for loan restructuring. The intended effect is to reduce the burden on farmers and FmHA personnel in servicing FmHA
loan collateral and to avoid encumbering all of a farmer's collateral, thereby making it less difficult for farmers
who receive FmHA loans to subsequently obtain non-FmHA credit.

We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a
``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this
proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a
material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866.

Discussion of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
shall be published for comment not withstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. FmHA is publishing
this proposed rule with a 15-day comment period. This proposed rule relieves the restriction of taking a lien on all
assets at the time of loan making. Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that the need to provide immediate assistance
to farmers who have suffered severe production and physical losses as a result of natural disasters also justifies
the shortened comment period under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major agricultural disasters during the 1993 crop year, including extensive flooding and rainfall in 9 Midwestern
States and drought in 3 Southeastern States will result in a significant increase in demand for FmHA direct loan assistance.
Requests will not be limited to emergency loan applications. In the 9 flood states alone, over 8 million acres of crops
were lost or not planted in 1993. Estimates indicate that the 1993 floods were the second costliest weather disaster
in the history of the United States. Preliminary estimates are that as many as 10,000 of the affected farmers may require
financial assistance from FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frequently, other lenders are willing to provide part of the farmers' credit needs, in combination with some FmHA
assistance. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing FmHA loan security requirements would preclude many lenders from continuing to provide credit to these
farmers. FmHA does not have the staff or financial resources to cope with this situation without participation from
private sector lenders. The need for a change in the regulations is immediate. Most farmers are now concluding 1993
operations, consulting with their lenders, and planning for 1994. FmHA is receiving loan requests at an increasing
rate. The Agency wants to give the public an opportunity for input on the proposed change but FmHA needs regulations
in place for spring planting, so a reasonable compromise was the 15-day comment period. Because of the scope of the
situation and the impact on local, regional, and national economies, the Agency believes that an amendment to the
regulations after a shortened comment period is the only way to assure that affected farmers receive the assistance
they need on a timely basis to recover from these disasters. Any further delay in the timing of this amendment will reduce
the Agency's ability to meet the needs of those affected, thus imposing additional hardships on those who have already
suffered substantially from flood or drought, and jeopardizing individual and community financial recovery from
these disasters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) submitted a report (GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;9) to the Senate Committee
on Agriculture addressing FmHA's loan making policies and practices. One of the concerns noted was FmHA's eroding
security position on many loans and the significant dollar losses being projected (and realized). One of GAO's recommendations
addressed the need for a change in FmHA collateral requirements. The report recommended additional security be taken
when servicing loans, including obtaining the best security interest available on all of the borrower's assets.
In an effort to reduce loan losses and protect the public interest, FmHA published a proposed rule on February 15, 1991,
requiring a lien on all assets when loans are made. A final rule implementing this policy was published on April 30,
1992. On April 30, 1992, the Agency also published an interim rule requiring a lien on all a borrower's assets when loans
are restructured. This policy had been issued as a proposed rule on October 23, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for a lien on all assets at the time a loan is made was intended to assure that FmHA had a security interest
in all of a borrower's property, reducing the potential for program abuse and loan losses. However, this policy has
proven unwieldy, imposing an excessive burden on FmHA borrowers and requiring an excessive amount of FmHA staff time.
When FmHA acquires a security interest in property owned by a borrower, that security must be serviced in accordance
with all FmHA regulations applying to the type of security property involved, regardless of the purpose of the loan.
For example, under existing regulations, the recipient of an FmHA FO loan must pledge not only real estate, but all
chattel property as well to secure the loan. The borrower must account to FmHA for all farm products sold, even though
FmHA's primary interest in the sale is for payment of the FO loan installment coming due, not the disposition of loan
security. This requirement imposes a major burden on borrowers, especially on those who sell farm products on a frequent
basis. Also, FmHA employees must spend a significant amount of time completing the necessary documentation for release
of its security interest for such sales. This time is a precious resource that the Agency believes would be better spent
providing advice and counsel to those borrowers under the most severe hardship who could benefit most from FmHA credit
supervision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the exceptions to FmHA's blanket lien requirement is that a lien will not be taken on chattel security when it
will prevent the applicant from obtaining operating credit from other sources. This exception does not adequately
correct the problems experienced with the lien on all assets rule. FmHA officials sometimes determine this exception
is not necessary at the time the loan is made. However, taking a lien can later interfere with a borrower's ability to
obtain credit from other sources, when borrowers have sufficient equity in assets to qualify for a non-FmHA loan to
meet a portion of their credit needs. The Agency can subordinate or release liens on security property to facilitate
credit from other lenders. However, these actions also impose a processing burden on borrowers and require staff
time. Further, the Agency has found that some lenders shy away from providing credit to such borrowers due to the time
and paperwork involved, even though the borrower otherwise meets the lender's loan criteria. The only recourse for
the borrower to meet his or her credit needs is to request FmHA assistance. Thus, the lien on all assets requirement
forces those borrowers who would otherwise not have a need for FmHA credit to consume resources which would be more
appropriately directed toward borrowers in greater difficulty. Devoting more attention to those borrowers who
desperately need intensive financial assistance and the time of FmHA staff should reduce the failure rate of these
borrowers, thereby reducing program costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this proposed rule is to make the loan security requirements less demanding while continuing to protect
the Government's interest. The Agency will continue to make loans provided the value of the security available is
at least equal to the amount of the loan. This is consistent with the authorizing statute and the Agency's mission of
providing assistance to farmers with limited financial resources. However, rather than requiring a lien on all a
borrower's additional assets, if any, when making a loan, FmHA generally will only require a lien on property only
to the point that the value of the security is at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. The Agency has determined
that security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount will provide adequate assurance of repayment. Studies
have indicated that loan liquidation costs are about 20 percent of the value of collateral. Additionally, the Agency
has a funding cost as a result of monies borrowed from the Treasury in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act
of 1990, which continues until the loan is paid or written off. This cost is difficult to estimate because interest
rates and liquidation periods vary widely. However, this cost should be no more than 30 percent of the loan amount on
the average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obtaining security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount is a goal. Generally, the Agency will be unable to
obtain security exactly meeting the 150 percent goal. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan will only be taken
when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land, same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood
sows), and when nonessential assets are taken as security for EM loans, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first security preference for operating type loans will be crops/chattels, and for real estate type loans the
first priority will be real estate. Where there are several collateral possibilities for chattels (cattle, machinery)
or real estate (different tracts of land), the FmHA loan approval official will select the most reasonable choice
to reach the 150 percent collateral goal. If the applicant offers an acceptable alternative, the loan approval official
will accept the applicant's choice. Because of this change, entity members no longer need to pledge their assets as
collateral. Entity members still will be personally obligated on the loan note(s). The Agency proposes to amend 7
CFR part 1941, subpart A, &sect;1941.19; part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19; part 1943, subpart B, &sect;1943.69;
and part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 to incorporate these changes. All loan making regulations are being changed
because most applicants affected by disasters apply for various types of farm loans and the changes are needed for
administrative consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19 to state that chattel property will be taken
as security for real estate loans only in certain situations. For the reasons discussed earlier with regard to burdensome
chattel security servicing requirements and reduced availability of conventional credit, farm ownership (FO)
loans will not be secured with chattels unless there is no other real estate available to provide security at least
equal to the loan amount, or unless the chattels are real estate improvements (fixtures) made with FO funds. Generally,
real estate values are more constant than chattel values and provide adequate loan security. Chattel security is
not desirable on long term real estate loans due to servicing difficulties and rapid depreciation. Because of the
limited circumstances in which certain chattel security will be taken on real estate loans, the exception for when
title to a livestock or crop enterprise is held by a contractor or under a share lease agreement is no longer needed.
The exception to taking a lien, therefore, is being removed from subparts A and B and part 1943. To clarify the existing
policy and to assure that all possibilities are considered when the available loan security is not at least equal to
the loan amount, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19, along with 7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, &sect;1941.19; 7
CFR part 1943, subpart B, &sect;1943.69; and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169, are revised to specifically
state that in situations where the farmer does not or will not have adequate real estate or chattel property to secure
the loan needed, other property, including real estate owned by a third party, can serve as security. A pledge of security
is preferable to a cosigner. 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart B, &sect;1943.69,
and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 will be revised accordingly. This policy already is stated in existing
7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, &sect;1941.19.

The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 to add a provision regarding nonessential
assets in EM loan situations. In many cases, EM loan applicants are not typical FmHA loan applicants in that they may
have significant nonfarm asset holdings. Prior to April 30, 1992, FmHA had required EM loan applicants to liquidate
nonessential assets prior to loan closing if possible, on the theory that the applicant's equity in these assets should
be used to reduce Government subsidized credit needs. This policy proved to impose hardship on farmers already suffering
from the affects of a disaster, with minimal results. In many cases, the assets in question could not be sold for the
estimated value, and thus no equity was realized. In other cases, the assets were not readily liquidated, and loan
recipients were forced to accept much less than true value, or unable to liquidate the assets at any price within the
necessary timeframe. As a result of these difficulties, FmHA modified this policy and amended the regulations to
require a lien on, rather than a sale of, such assets. A lien on all nonessential assets (with no 150% limit) assures
the Agency that the equity will be applied to reducing the farmer's Federally subsidized credit when nonessential
assets are sold. On this basis, the requirement for a lien on all nonessential assets in the case of EM loans is continued
even though the requirement for a lien on all farm assets is substantially modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Agency has amended 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, &sect;1951.910. The requirement that liens will be taken
on all assets when loans are restructured will be continued to protect against potential loan losses as a result of
extended repayment terms. The Agency proposes to continue this action since a significant amount of debt has been
written off over the years, the Agency continues to have a large number of financially stressed high-risk borrowers,
and to comply with the GAO report discussed previously in this rule. This section had previously referred to the loan
making regulations to prescribe the security requirements for loan restructuring. Since the requirements for loan
making will now be different from loan servicing, it is necessary to insert the guidelines into the debt restructuring
regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the security for the loan under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is not at least equal to 150 percent of the
loan amount, the best lien obtainable will be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point
that security for the loan at least equals 150 percent of the loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When there are several alternatives available (cattle, machinery), any one of which will meet the security requirements
of this section, the approval official will select the most logical and efficient alternative for obtaining security.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When alternatives exist and the applicant has a preference as to the property to be taken for security, the approval
official will honor the preference so long as the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are
met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Real estate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan approval official will require a lien on all or part of the applicant's real estate as security when chattel
security alone is not at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. Different lien positions on real estate
are considered separate and identifiable collateral.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A pledge of real estate or chattels by a third party may be taken as security when the property owned by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other property that cannot be converted to cash without jeopardizing the applicant's farm operation or imposing
substantial financial penalty on the applicant may be taken as additional security when the property owned by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender
value of life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Security for real estate type purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EM loans made for subtitle A (real estate) purposes will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security
also may be taken as security. The total amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount,
or all real estate owned by the applicant. A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security
for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount, except as provided for in &sect;1945.169(e)(2) of this section. Except
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken
when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official
may require a cosigner as defined in &sect;1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter, or a pledge of security
from someone other than the applicant(s). A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner.

(A) Prior lien instruments do not contain provisions for future advances (except for taxes, insurance, and other
costs needed to protect the security, or reasonable foreclosure costs), cancellation, summary forfeiture, or other
clauses that may jeopardize the Government's interest or the applicant's ability to pay the loan unless any such undesirable
provision is waived, modified, or subordinated insofar as the Government is concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Agreements are obtained from prior lienholders to give notice of foreclosure to FmHA whenever State law or other
arrangements do not require such a notice. Any agreements needed will be obtained as provided in subpart B of part 1927
of this chapter, except as modified by the ``Memorandum of Understanding-FCA-FmHA,'' FmHA Instruction 2000&hyph;R
(available in any FmHA office).

(2) Chattel security. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Loans will be secured by chattels as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures purchased or refinanced with loan funds whenever such property
cannot be included in the real estate lien and the additional security is needed to secure the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Chattel security will be obtained when there is not enough real estate security for the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Therefore,
junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity in the property. However, when possible, a first lien
on selected chattel items should be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Chattel security liens will be obtained and kept effective, as provided in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter.

(i) A pledge of real estate by a third party may be taken as security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other property may be taken as additional security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender value of
life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.

Nonessential assets are assets which the applicant has an ownership interest in that do not contribute a net income
to pay family living expenses or to maintain a sound farming operation (see &sect;1962.17 of subpart A of part 1962
of this chapter for further guidance). A lien will be taken on all nonessential assets if an applicant cannot or will
not dispose of the assets and use the proceeds to reduce the FmHA credit needs prior to loan closing. The 150 percent
security requirement does not apply to nonessential assets.

Delinquent borrowers must pledge certain assets, essential and nonessential, unencumbered to FmHA as security
at the time FmHA loans are restructured, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The best lien obtainable will be taken on all assets owned by the borrower. When the borrower is an entity, the best

lien positions on real estate are considered separate and identifiable collateral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Security will include, but is not limited to, the following: land, buildings, structures, fixtures, machinery,
equipment, livestock, livestock products, growing crops, stored crops, inventory, supplies, accounts receivable,
certain cash or special cash collateral accounts, marketable securities, certificates of ownership of precious
metals, and cash surrender value of life insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Security will also include assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, revenues,
royalties from mineral rights, patents and copyrights, and pledges of security by third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The exceptions set forth in &sect;1941.19(c) of subpart A of part 1941 apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations to eliminate the requirement that States maintain specified
Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We are
proposing instead to require the States to successfully close (epidemiologically investigate and resolve) certain
percentages of cases detected through the MCI program. We believe these amendments would better serve Federal and
State animal health officials in their efforts to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brucellosis is an infectious disease of certain animals and humans. In its principal animal hosts, it is characterized
by abortion and impaired fertility. Through a cooperative Federal-State effort, the United States is now approaching
total eradication of the field strain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella abortus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in domestic cattle and bison herds. As of May 1993, there were only 337 known infected cattle and bison herds, and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had declared 32 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands free of the
disease. Fewer than 500 new infected herds were identified last year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison,
and swine to prevent the spread of brucellosis. Section 78.1 defines the terms used in the regulations. In accordance
with &sect;78.1, States and areas can be classified as Class Free, Class A, Class B, or Class C. These terms refer to
stages of the eradication process as determined by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
and State animal health officials. Class Free States and areas are considered to be free of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella abortus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in all domestic livestock, and Class C States and areas have the highest levels of brucellosis infection. Section
78.1 sets forth the standards States or areas must meet to achieve and maintain each of the classifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One standard for classification is the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rate. Under the MCI
program, slaughtering establishments must collect blood samples from 95 percent of all cows and bulls 2 years of age
and older (known as MCI test cattle). The samples are then subjected to an official brucellosis test. Animals that
have serologically positive results to the official brucellosis test administered under the MCI program are MCI
reactors. The regulations require animal health officials to trace MCI reactors to the farm of origin and conduct
an epidemiologic investigation, to evaluate the risk that brucellosis could spread from the farm of origin. Class
Free and Class A States and areas must trace at least 90 percent of all MCI reactors to the farm of origin, and Class B and
Class C States and areas must trace at least 80 percent to the farm of origin. When required by the results of the epidemiologic
investigation, herd blood tests must be conducted or the herds must be confined to the premises under quarantine.
Examples of when herd testing or quarantine may not be necessary include cases where epidemiologic investigation
reveals the MCI reactor results were not caused by field strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or that the herd has been or will be sent to slaughter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MCI reactor prevalence rate is the rate of infection in a State or area's cattle population based on the percentage
of MCI reactors found in the total number of MCI tested cattle. Under the regulations, Class Free States and areas must
maintain a 12-consecutive-month MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed 0.050 percent. For Class A States and areas,
the rate must not exceed 0.10 percent, and for Class B States and areas, the rate must not exceed 0.30 percent. Class
C States and areas have an MCI reactor prevalence rate that exceeds 0.30 percent. Class Free, Class A, and Class B States
and areas that exceed the required percentages may be reclassified to a lower classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tests used to identify MCI reactors detect not only serum titers caused by brucellosis infection but also serum titers
caused by certain other organisms and by vaccination. As a result of such spurious titers, an estimate of brucellosis
prevalence based solely on the MCI reactor prevalence rate in a State or area would overestimate the rate of brucellosis
infection. Nevertheless, the MCI reactor data has been helpful to Federal and State animal health officials who use
the rates of the individual States and areas to reveal trends and to compare their progress in eradicating brucellosis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the United States had thousands of infected herds, we did not consider the effect of spurious titers on the States'
and areas' MCI reactor prevalence rates to be significant. However, as the level of brucellosis infection in this
country has declined, the proportion of spurious titers in the MCI reactor prevalence rates has increased. As a result,
in Class Free States and areas, the MCI reactor prevalence rate may consist entirely of spurious titers. Therefore,
we no longer believe a State or area's MCI reactor prevalence rate is a good indication of its eradication progress,
and we are proposing to eliminate the requirement in the regulations that States and areas meet specific MCI reactor
prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If States no longer need to meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates, we believe it is even more important for the
States to concentrate on the activities required following identification of an MCI reactor (tracebacks, epidemiologic
investigations, and, usually, herd testing or quarantine). The epidemiologic investigation and herd testing can
reveal whether an MCI reaction is a spurious titer or a valid indication of brucellosis. If herd testing reveals one
or more animals that test positive to the official test for brucellosis (brucellosis reactors), all other animals
in the herd are considered brucellosis exposed. Brucellosis reactor cattle and brucellosis exposed cattle may move
interstate only in accordance with subpart B of part 78 (&sect;&sect;78.5 through 78.14), to control the spread of
brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a herd is quarantined in lieu of testing following epidemiologic investigation of an MCI reactor herd, the quarantine
protects against the possibility that the herd may be infected and could spread brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Herd testing or quarantine only occur for MCI reactor cases that are ``successfully closed'' (defined below). The
larger the number of MCI reactor cases that are not successfully closed, the greater the possibility that brucellosis
could spread from herds associated with the uninvestigated MCI reactors. Therefore, we are proposing to require
that a minimum percentage of MCI reactor cases must be successfully closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would consider MCI reactor cases that have been traced to the farm of origin to be successfully closed when: (1) An
epidemiologic investigation is completed within specified time limits; and (2) the herd is tested, or State or APHIS
animal health officials confine the animals to their premises under quarantine; or (3) State or APHIS animal health
officials determine there is justification for not testing the herd or quarantining it. We propose to add to &sect;78.1
a definition of ``successfully closed case'' that reflects this standard for successful closure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Class Free and Class A States, animal health officials would have to complete the epidemiologic investigation
within 15 days after they are notified by the cooperative State-Federal laboratory that brucellosis reactors were
found on an MCI test. For Class B and Class C States, the time limit would be 30 days. This time standard for completing
the epidemiologic investigation is the same standard required in the current regulations. Experience with brucellosis
program operations has shown the time limits to be long enough to be workable for animal health officials, and short
enough to support effective controls on the spread of brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe there are circumstances that would constitute acceptable justification for not testing or quarantining
a herd following an MCI reactor traceback. The current regulations merely state that herd testing or quarantine will
be employed ``[W]hen required by the results of the epidemiologic investigation.'' We would like to provide more
specific guidance concerning when it would be justified to forego herd testing or quarantine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to require that herd blood tests be conducted or the herd be confined to the premises under quarantine
within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist
determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The brucellosis reactor is located in a herd in a different State than the State where the MCI blood sample was collected.
In such cases a State representative or APHIS representative must give written notice of the MCI test results to the
State animal health official in the State where the brucellosis reactor is located; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Evidence indicates that the brucellosis reactor is from a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis,
or is from a herd that is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis. Such evidence could include, but is not limited to,
situations where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that has been sold for slaughter in entirety. In this case, the potential
for the herd to spread brucellosis no longer exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that is certified brucellosis free and is 100-percent vaccinated.
In such cases it is probable that the MCI test was a false positive, due to a titer caused by the vaccine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The brucellosis reactor showed a low titer on the MCI test and is traced back to a dairy herd that is 100 percent vaccinated
and has tested negative to the most recent brucellosis ring test required by the regulations. This is another case
where the probability of a false positive or other error in the MCI test is far greater than the probability that the
herd of origin is affected by brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animal health officials could report a traceback to a farm of origin in another State as a successfully closed case
because we do not expect animal health officials to conduct epidemiologic investigations and herd testing in another
State. However, as part of successfully closing the case we would require them to notify in writing the State animal
health official in the State where the farm of origin is located so officials in that State could take proper follow-up
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, Class Free and Class A States and areas would need to successfully close at least 95 percent of
the MCI reactor cases traced to the farm of origin, and Class B and Class C States and areas would need to successfully
close at least 90 percent of such cases. This means that 1 in 20 MCI reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class Free
and Class A States, and 1 in 10 reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class B and Class C States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, this proposal would reduce current recordkeeping requirements for the States. While State officials
would still need to compile data, the time involved should be much less than what is currently required for computing
the MCI reactor prevalence rate. Under our proposal, States would focus their recordkeeping on a fairly small number
of MCI reactors, rather than the much larger number of cattle with negative MCI test results. States would no longer
need to count all cattle tested, separate out cattle from other States, and then calculate an MCI reactor prevalence
rate based on the number of their State's cattle that were tested and the number of MCI reactors found through such testing.
Instead, each State would need to include in its annual report to APHIS the percentage of MCI reactor cases it successfully
closes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the
Department, we have determined that this proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only State animal health agencies would be affected by this proposed rule; it would have no effect on the private sector.
State animal health officials would need to provide information on only the MCI reactors detected each month instead
of total numbers of MCI test cattle slaughtered. They would also need to maintain records of the numbers of MCI reactor
cases that are successfully closed and report the percentage of successfully closed cases annually to APHIS. The
States are already required to carry out the activities that constitute successful case closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

State-Federal laboratory that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test. Herd blood tests must be conducted
or the herd must be confined to the premises under quarantine within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors
were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist determines that:

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to modify the current Class D airspace and to establish a Class E extension to the Class D surface
area at Roswell, NM. This action proposes to amend a previous airspace action that established a 14.8 NM Class D airspace
extension to the Class D surface area for Roswell, NM. Because the arrival extension is greater than two miles, it should
have been classified as Class E airspace. However, it was incorrectly classified as Class D airspace. The intended
effect of this proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a class
E airspace extension to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain
IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class D
airspace at Roswell, NM. The current Class D airspace at Roswell Industrial Air Center, NM, was modified by rulemaking
action dated December 12, 1993 (58 FR 63885). That modification included an extension of the Class D airspace within
3.7 miles each side of the Chisum Very High Omni-Directional Radio Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) 290
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; radial extending from the 5.0-mile radius to 14.8 miles northwest of the airport. That extension to the Class
D airpace in excess of 2 nautical miles should have been classified as Class E airspace. The intended effect of this
proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a Class E airspace extension
to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and
require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as extensions to Class D surface areas are published in Paragraph
6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection
with the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The proposed rule increases some of the fees based
on updates of estimates of direct costs to the Board of providing these services and adds a fee for transmittal of documents
by other than regular mail.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the
processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication,
and review. The fees currently provided for in &sect;200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing
requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. Consequently,
the Board proposes to increase these fees presently found in &sect;200.4(g) and to add a new paragraph to provide a
charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact
analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this proposed rule within the meaning
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

or hand-delivered to the debtor, or in the case of a debt which is subject to section 10(c) of the Railroad Retirement
Act or section 2(d) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, interest shall accrue from the date that a denial of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The penalty charge shall accrue from the date on which the debt became delinquent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A debt is delinquent if it has not been paid in full by the 30th day after the date on which the initial demand letter
was first mailed or hand-delivered, or, if the debt is being repaid under an installment payment agreement, at any
time after the debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation for payment thereunder.

Section 12(o) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides that benefits payable to an employee with respect
to days of sickness shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay damages for such infirmity. The
Board shall be entitled to reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such employee or other person through
suits, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a liability under
health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have
paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom
such right or claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such right or claim, any judgment obtained
thereunder, and any sum or damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount to which the Board is entitled
by way of reimbursement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 341.6 of the Board's regulations provides that a person or company subject to the lien must notify the agency
within five days of a settlement or judgment and must pay the agency the amount withheld to satisfy the lien within 30
days. In the case where a lien arises in favor of the Board as a result of a settlement or judgment but the Board is not notified
of the settlement or judgment in a timely manner, the employer or third party who has been served with a Notice of Lien
and notice of the amount of that lien already has notice of the existence and amount of the debt. Accordingly, interest
should accrue from the date of settlement or judgment, but would be waived if paid within 30 days in accordance with
&sect;200.7(g)(1) of the Board's regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Likewise, a section 12(o) debt should be considered delinquent if the lien is not satisfied within 30 days after settlement
or entry of judgment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Consequently, the Board proposes to amend &sect;200.7 of its regulations to provide for the accrual of interest on
section 12(o) debts and for the accrual of penalties on such debts when they become delinquent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25204 at 25232), FDA proposed talc, 45 to 100 percent, as Category I (generally recognized as
safe and effective and not misbranded) as an OTC skin protectant active ingredient for the treatment and prevention
of diaper rash. Specific warnings and directions were proposed for powder products containing talc. The final monograph
for OTC skin protectant drug products will be published in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The discussion of talc at these public meetings may be considered by the agency in the preparation of this final monograph
for OTC skin protectant drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these meetings is to provide a forum for an updated discussion of the origins, manufacture, characterization,
toxicology, and epidemiology of talc and related products. The principal focus will be on the latest toxicologic
and epidemiologic studies, particularly as they reflect on the safe uses of talc in consumer products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following topic areas will be discussed: (1) Characteristics of cosmetic-grade talc; (2) a history of the uses
of talc in a variety of consumer products; (3) current quality control measures to insure safety; (4) the regulatory
history of talc; (5) recent National Toxicology Program studies of chronic pulmonary exposure of rodents to talc
and the relevance of these studies to human risk assessment; and (6) the significance of contrasting epidemiologic
studies of talc exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speakers and panelists will include well-known regulatory specialists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, pathologists,
talc product manufacturers, talc production experts, and consumer representatives. A critical panel discussion
by speakers and invited experts will complete each session.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2002 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Highway Safety Programs,
requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs include six critical programs. The existing
18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA, but do not specifically
address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. The agencies therefore propose to amend the regulations by adopting
guidelines for these two programs. The agencies also propose to issue a guideline on Roadway Safety, corresponding
to the Roadway Safety Priority Program Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to three new guidelines, the agencies propose to revise six of the existing 18 guidelines to reflect new
issues and to emphasize program methodology and approaches which have proven to be especially successful in these
program areas. The guidelines the agencies propose to revise are as follows:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 402 of the Highway Safety Act of 1966 directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate uniform standards
for State highway safety programs, specified the subjects of several standards, and required States to conform to
these uniform standards or risk losing portions of their Federal-aid highway funds. Between 1967 and 1972, the Secretary
promulgated 18 Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs (published at 23 CFR part 1204).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1976, the section 402 program was principally directed at achieving State and local conformance with the 18
Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions available
for non-compliance. In 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the Secretary
would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard.
As a result, the standards became guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program shifted from one focused
upon enforcing program standards to one focused upon problem identification, countermeasure development and evaluation,
with the standards to be used as a framework for the State programs. Few changes have been made in the guidelines since
that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 2002 of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs
include programs: (1) To reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of the posted
speed limits; (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and
child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles
equipped with airbags; (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired
by alcohol or a controlled substance; (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from crashes involving motor vehicles
and motorcycles; (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from crashes involving school buses; and (6) to improve
law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the areas represented by these six guidelines (i.e., Impaired Driving, Occupant Protection, Motorcycle
Safety, and Police Traffic Services) have previously been identified as National Priority Program Areas (under
23 CFR part 1205). Other Priority Areas include Emergency Medical Services, Pedestrian/Bicycle Safety, Traffic
Records, and Roadway Safety. Although Speed Control and School Bus Safety are not currently Priority Areas, the agencies
are now engaged in another rulemaking action and in a separate notice in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 are considering whether to amend 23 CFR part 1205 to include Speed Control and/or School Buses as National Priority
Program Areas. Further, the Guideline for Pupil Transportation was revised in April of 1991 and needs no further revision
at this time. In addition, section 4002 of ISTEA requires that State agencies which receive Motor Carrier Safety Assistance
Program (MCSAP) grants coordinate their respective commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety enforcement plans with
the State highway safety agency (49 CFR 350). FHWA administers the MCSAP.

Under MCSAP, States conduct uniform inspections of commercial motor vehicles at roadside sites and perform safety
reviews of carriers to check for compliance with safety and hazardous materials regulations. Under the ISTEA, MCSAP
was expanded to include additional safety activities, such as traffic enforcement, impaired driving initiatives,
uniform truck and bus accident reporting, vehicle weight enforcement, training for hazardous materials enforcements,
Commercial Drivers License (CDL) enforcement, research and development, public education, and drug interdiction
efforts. Information on CMV inspections and crashes is collected by the States and transmitted electronically to
FHWA's mainframe through the SAFETYNET system. Since all States have access to SAFETYNET, information on the system
can be valuable in identifying problems and improving traffic safety. The agencies encourage States to coordinate
their section 402 plans and activities with MCSAP where appropriate in order to maximize benefits to both programs.

Proposed Addition of Three New Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing 18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA;
they do not specifically address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. Therefore, the agencies propose to issue
two new guidelines: Highway Safety Program Guideline No. 19, Speed Control; and Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 20, Occupant Protection. Though Speed Control has always been a component of the Police Traffic Services Priority
Area, it requires special attention in light of the involvement of speed in many traffic crashes. The agencies also
intend to take this opportunity to propose issuance of one additional guideline, which would be identified as Highway
Safety Program Guideline No. 21, Roadway Safety. The Roadway Safety Guideline is a consolidation of the key aspects
of various Guidelines which relate to the roadway. The addition of these new guidelines will result in a formal guideline
corresponding to each of the current National Priority Program Areas. Because the vast majority of all highway safety
projects funded under title 23 U.S.C. 402 are designed to address one or more of these Priority Program Areas, the existence
of corresponding guidelines for each will be of great value to the States and communities in the design and implementation
of highway safety programs.

19: Speed Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA. Over the course of the agency's history,
NHTSA has funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Some common conclusions from
these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling
in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, Speed Control has not been separately identified as a National Priority Program Area under 23 CFR part
1204. It has, however, been an integral part of the Priority Program Area involving Police Traffic Services, resulting
in numerous programs at the State and local levels. In addition, the FHWA, through the MCSAP, supports speed control
initiatives as part of an overall traffic enforcement program aimed specifically at commercial motor vehicles.
The agencies are currently engaged in rulemaking to add Speed Control as a separate National Priority Program Area.
This proposed guideline is written to assist States and communities in the design and implementation of effective
Speed Control Programs. The guideline sets forth recommendations for the development and management of effective
speed control plans, visible public information and education efforts to gain voluntary compliance, promotion
of the use of new technology in the enforcement of speed laws, the establishment of safe and reasonable speed limits,
and effective training for police officers involved in speed control.

20: Occupant Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the original highway safety program standards were established by NHTSA and FHWA, an occupant protection program
was not among them. Although lap and shoulder belts have been required for front outboard positions and lap belts for
all other seating positions in all passenger cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1968, belt usage remained very low
through the 1970's. In 1970, under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, FHWA required drivers of commercial
motor vehicles in interstate commerce to use a safety belt if it was installed in the vehicle. During the 1980's, States
participating in MCSAP adopted this requirement for commercial motor vehicle drivers in intrastate commerce. During
the 1970's, a national Highway Safety Needs Study indicated that significant reductions in highway losses could
be achieved with increased public use of occupant protection devices. NHTSA began to explore promotional activities
to encourage the public to buckle up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982, the agencies issued a final rule which identified six National Priority Program Areas that were considered
the most effective in reducing highway deaths and injuries. Occupant Protection was included as one of the six most
effective programs.

Although the agencies never issued a highway safety program standard or guideline, occupant protection has remained
a National Priority Program Area. Recognition of the importance of this program increased substantially during
the 1980's with evidence that safety belts are effective in preventing death and serious injury in 40&hyph;50 percent
of all crashes; passage or upgrading of child safety seat usage laws in every State; passage of safety belt use laws
in a majority of States; major increases in funding at the Federal, State and local levels; and significant increases
in occupant protection use rates. The agencies have conducted two subsequent rulemakings to review the effectiveness
of the Priority Program Areas. No comments have been received from the public suggesting that the area of occupant
protection should be deleted from the list of National Priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The life-saving benefits of occupant protection programs are now widely recognized. The proposed Occupant Protection
program guideline has been prepared to provide current information on effective program elements for States to use
in producing and assessing their programs. The proposed guideline reflects the experience of States in program content
and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety programs relating to occupant protection. The guideline
sets forth recommendations for effective management and evaluation of occupant protection programs, legislative
initiatives and employment policies mandating use of occupant protection devices, strategic efforts to enforce
use laws and policies, public information efforts to reinforce use laws or policies and to inform the public of enforcement
efforts, and education programs to promote occupant protection through various organizations including health
and medical groups, schools, and employers throughout the State.

21: Roadway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the original 18 standards were established under the Highway Safety Act of 1966, FHWA was responsible for developing
and implementing programs relating to the roadway environment. Thus, Standards 9, 12, 13, and the roadway-related
aspects of Standard 14 (Pedestrian Safety) fell under FHWA's purview. In 1981, when FHWA and NHTSA identified six
highway safety program areas which were considered the most effective, and thus designated National Priority Program
Areas, one of the six was FHWA's Safety Construction and Operational Improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, when the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of the various programs and retained the six priority areas,
the Safety Construction and Operational Improvement Priority Program was changed to ``Roadway Safety'' to encompass
a wider breadth of safety activities which are related to the driving environment. Roadway Safety involves various
highway safety activities which relate to safety aspects of the roadway environment. Currently, many roadway safety-related
activities are described in three of the original Highway Safety Program Guidelines:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to more effectively organize and consolidate the roadway safety components from each of these various guidelines,
the agencies propose to create a new guideline entitled ``Roadway Safety''. While the four related guidelines will
remain unchanged, the new Roadway Safety Guideline highlights selected aspects from these four guidelines which
are recommended to be included in any State Roadway Safety program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of these three new guidelines will ensure that guidelines reflecting the current state-of-the-art
are available for each of the National Priority Program Areas listed at 23 CFR part 1205.

Proposed Revision of Six Existing Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the original program standards were issued in the early 1970's, much has changed in both technology and societal
behavior which affects the methodology and approach to solving highway safety problems. When the standards were
originally issued, there were no State laws requiring safety belt or child safety seat use, there was little public
awareness about drunk driving, and highway safety was not yet a matter of great public concern. Because the highway
safety environment has changed so dramatically during the past twenty years, the agencies propose to update the guidelines
to provide current information on effective program content for States to use in producing and assessing their traffic
safety programs. Each of the proposed revised guidelines reflects the experience of States in traffic safety program
content and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety. They provide a framework for producing and
assessing a balanced highway safety program and a tool with which States can assess the effectiveness of their own
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies propose to update only those guidelines which correspond to the programs currently designated as Priority
Areas. The agencies strongly believe that focusing attention on the priority programs has the greatest impact on
highway safety. The revised guidelines will emphasize these areas of national concern and highlight the effective
countermeasures which are available, while continuing to permit States to receive funding for additional areas
of local concern when justified, and thus ensure that section 402 resources are being allocated in the most effective
manner.

Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 3_Motorcycle Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elements of the present Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 address the following safety issues: (1) Preventing
or reducing the severity of head injuries; (2) determining whether novice motorcyclists have the basic skills; and
(3) assuring that the vehicles have minimum safety equipment and are adequately maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 continues to emphasize the importance of motorcyclists wearing
helmets and places great emphasis on improving the knowledge and skills of all motorcycle operators through motorcycle
rider education and training programs. The guideline also strongly encourages states and communities to develop
comprehensive motorcycle safety programs that address (1) the effective management of the program through a central
or lead agency; (2) the requirement for special licensing exams; (3) the influence of alcohol and other drugs on motorcyclists;
and (4) the issues of motorcycle conspicuity and motorist awareness.

Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 8_Alcohol in Relation to Highway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Guideline No. 8 contains the elements which provide the basic structure underlying the drinking and driving
laws of the states. These include the use of chemical tests, the establishment of a BAC value (.10%) which is presumptive
evidence of intoxication and the enactment of laws establishing the ``implied consent'' of a motorist to submit to
a chemical test. The other components of the current guideline relate to the collection of data on alcohol-related
fatalities, and the specifications and qualifications of chemical testing equipment and personnel administering
the tests. The primary effort of the guideline was to establish some reasonable conformity with a uniform legal basis
for detecting and prosecuting drunk drivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current guideline, the States follow a ``specific deterrence'' approach designed to remove from the road
those who had been arrested for DWI. However, the majority of alcohol-related crashes involve drivers with no previous
DWI arrest; moreover, the majority of intoxicated drivers on the road go undetected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guideline No. 8, entitled ``Impaired Driving'', reflects a comprehensive, community-based approach
with goals of (1) preventing people from being killed and injured in the short-term through general deterrence programs,
and (2) permanently reducing the number of drinking and drugged drivers through long-term prevention and intervention
measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the general deterrence approach, the objective is to increase the perceived risk by the drinking driver that
he or she will be caught and convicted of DWI. The proposed guideline recommends states establish a BAC value of .08%
as the illegal per se level, at or above which a drive is considered to be driving while intoxicated; implement specific
countermeasures designed to better equip and train police officers in recognizing, tracking, and arresting impaired
drivers; enable prompt suspension of drivers licenses through streamlined administrative procedures; result
in punitive action such as fines, community service, jail or the suspension of driving privileges; and ensure the
public is fully aware of the increased enforcement efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the ``prevention and intervention'' approach, the guideline recommends strategies which are aimed at permanently
changing the public's attitudes and behaviors concerning drinking and driving. These include public information
and education for students in schools and colleges, for adults through programs in the workplace and for the general
population through programs in health care settings. Other education efforts include promotion of designated driver
programs, responsible alcohol service efforts, citizen support and outreach efforts, and the establishment of
self-sufficient programs requiring offenders to defray program costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States should also be aware of and enforce alcohol and drug requirements for CMV drivers. The FHWA established
a BAC level of .04 percent as the threshold at which a CMV driver is considered to be under the influence of alcohol and
subject to disqualification from driving ranging from one year to life. In addition, a CMV driver found to have any
measurable or detectable alcohol level in his or her system while operating a CMV is prohibited from driving for 24
hours. FHWA also requires motor carriers to have specific drug testing programs of CMV drivers in place.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 10_Traffic Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Traffic Records Guideline is directed toward improving the operational efficiency of record systems
involving crash statistics, driver licensing, vehicle registration, vehicle inspection, traffic citations,
roadway related data, EMS, and driver education. In the past, however, the operational condition of many of these
record systems maintained by the States was insufficient to provide a reliable total information base. The growth
of the files as well as increased processing costs caused administrators to seek methods of modernizing the files
and improving compatibility of related systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guideline No. 10 recommends methods to establish comprehensive traffic records systems to enable states
to use data to identify emerging traffic safety problems, develop appropriate countermeasures, and evaluate program
performance. The guideline focuses attention on the need to link computer systems, establish uniform data elements
including CMV crash data and integrate data elements where appropriate. In addition, the proposed guideline suggests
innovative driver licensing techniques that will effectively identify problem drivers whose driver licenses have
been suspended or revoked in other states.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 11_Emergency Medical Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Guideline No. 11 is based upon the philosophy that by improving pre-hospital
emergency medical services in general, the system will serve the highway-injured patient better. The focus of programs
under this guideline has been upon those elements of emergency medical care which precede the patient's arrival in
a hospital emergency department. This includes setting standards and requirements for qualified and trained personnel,
the types and number of ambulances and other emergency response vehicles, communication systems and equipment,
and coordination with other components of the medical care system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the maturing of the nationwide EMS Program, the proposed EMS Guideline No. 11 reflects a new emphasis and expanded
focus for emergency medical services. The proposed guideline recommends improvements to the entire emergency medical
services system for highway-injured patients. The elements deemed most effective in improving trauma care for the
highway-injured patient include a common phone number (e.g., 9&hyph;1&hyph;1) for quick public access, communication
between ambulances and hospitals, trained first responders and pre-hospital personnel, adequate and appropriate
transportation coverage, highly trained in-hospital personnel at specialized trauma care centers, pre-hospital
and hospital coordination, and improved data on trauma patients. The proposed guideline also recommends improved
public information, education and injury prevention efforts.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 14_Pedestrian Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Pedestrian Guideline No. 14 does not address Bicycle Safety Programs. The guideline was developed when
Pedestrian Safety was not a National Priority Program Area and before many countermeasures were proven to be effective.
The current guideline is narrowly focused on single issue countermeasure activities which involved primarily the
inventory of the pedestrian problem; education, particularly aimed at young school children; and engineering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a NHTSA/FHWA joint NPRM published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on May 3, 1991, the agencies stated that effective countermeasures have been developed to address both Pedestrian
and Bicycle safety problems and specifically, concerns caused by an increase in the elderly population and the growth
in popularity of walking, jogging and bicycling. On October 4, 1991, a Final Rule was issued making Pedestrian and
Bicycle Safety a National Priority program area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guideline No. 14 addresses both pedestrian and bicycle safety and describes countermeasures that are
comprehensive in nature, involve a multi-disciplinary approach. These require the combined and coordinated support
of law enforcement, education, public health, driver education and licensing, transportation engineering, and
public communications. In addition, the guideline provides for legislative and regulatory solutions, outlines
methods to enlist the support of individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community,
features innovative school-based practices, and highlights traffic engineering components that promote pedestrian
and bicycle safety while reducing traffic congestion.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 15_Police Traffic Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Police Traffic Service Guideline No. 15 emphasizes the use of police patrols to enforce traffic laws,
improve traffic flow, prevent crashes, aid the injured, document each crash, supervise cleanup, and restore traffic
flow. The guideline provides minimum standards by which a police department can measure its quality in traffic services,
and suggests uniform training procedures, as well as standardized records and reporting systems. The guideline
also addresses selective assignment of personnel and coordination with other agencies and neighboring jurisdictions
and recommends in-service training for police personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proliferation of highway safety legislation in recent years, such as tougher DWI laws, child restraint and seat
belt use laws, and commercial motor vehicle safety laws, combined with an increased demand for other law enforcement
services, has placed a strain on police agencies during a time of reduced budgets, manpower and resources. The proposed
Guideline No. 15 assists law enforcement agencies by addressing how to do more with less. Such efforts include developing
and participating in comprehensive programs; enlisting support of the media, community leaders, business and volunteer/activist
groups; developing resource management plans; and training officers in state-of-the-art enforcement curricula.

Impaired Driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive program to combat impaired
driving. This guideline describes the areas that each State's program should address. Throughout this guideline,
``impaired driving'' means operating any motor vehicle while one's faculties are affected by alcohol or other drugs,
medications, or other substances. ``Impaired driving'' includes, but is not limited to, impairment as defined in
State statutes.

I. Prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State should have prevention programs to reduce impaired driving through approaches commonly associated with
public health_altering social norms, changing risky or dangerous behaviors, and creating protective environments.
Prevention and public health programs promote activities to educate the public on the effects of alcohol and other
drugs, limit alcohol and drug availability, and prevent those impaired by alcohol and drugs from driving. Prevention
programs are typically carried out in schools, work sites, medical and health care facilities, and community groups.
Each State should implement a system of impaired driving prevention activities and to work with the public health
community to foster health and reduce traffic-related injuries.

II. Deterrence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should have a deterrence program to reduce impaired driving through activities to create the maximum possible
perception of detection, arrest and punishment among persons who might be tempted to drive under the influence of
alcohol or other drugs, including CMV drivers. Close coordination with law enforcement agencies on the municipal,
county, and State levels is needed to create and sustain the perceived risk of being detected and arrested. Specialized
traffic enforcement efforts, such as MCSAP, also serve as a core element in the detection of impaired drivers. Equally
close coordination with courts and the motor vehicle licensing and registration agency is needed to enhance the fear
of punishment. Effective use of all available media is essential to create and maintain a strong public awareness
of impaired driving enforcement and sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State should implement a system of activities to deter impaired driving. The deterrence system should include
legislation, public information and education, enforcement, prosecution, adjudication, criminal sanctions,
driver licensing, and vehicle registration activities. The goal should be to increase the perception and probability
of arrest for violators and the imposition of swift and sure sanctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Prosecution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should implement a comprehensive program for visible and aggressive prosecution of impaired driving cases.
These programs should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Give DWI cases high priority for prosecution;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Licensing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Driver licensing actions can be an effective means for preventing, deterring, and monitoring impaired driving.
In addition to the license sanctions for impaired driving offenses discussed earlier, States should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue provisional licenses to novice drivers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide for license suspension for driver under age 21 who drives with a BAC exceeding .02 (or some other low value);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actively participate in the Driver License Compact to facilitate the exchange of driver license information between
jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Treatment and Rehabilitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many first-time impaired driving offenders and most repeat offenders have substantial substance abuse problems
that affect their entire lives, not just their driving. They have been neither prevented nor deterred from impaired
driving. Each State should implement a system to identify and refer these drivers to appropriate substance abuse
treatment programs to change their dangerous behavior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Diagnosis and Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should have a systematic program to evaluate persons who have been convicted of an impaired driving offense
to determine if they have an alcohol or drug abuse problem. This evaluation should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Be required by law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be conducted by qualified personnel prior to sentencing; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be used to decide whether a substance abuse treatment program should be part of the sanctions imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Treatment and Rehabilitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should establish and maintain programs to treat alcohol and other drug dependent persons referred through
traffic courts and other sources. These programs should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensure that those referred for impaired driving offenses are not permitted to drive again until their substance abuse
problems are under control;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be conducted in addition to, not as a substitute for, license restrictions and other sanctions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be conducted separately for youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Good program management produces effective programs. Planning and coordination are especially important for impaired
driving activities, since many different parties are involved. Each State's impaired driving program management
system should have an established process for managing its planning (including problem identification), program
control, and evaluation activities. The system should provide for community traffic safety programs (CTSPs), State
and local task forces, data analysis, and funding. It also should include planning and coordination of activities
with other agencies involved in impaired driving programs, such as MCSAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. State Program Planning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should develop and implement an overall plan for all impaired driving activities. The plan should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Be based on careful problem definition that makes use of crash and driver record data; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct State and community resources toward effective measures that address the State's impaired driving issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Program Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should establish procedures to ensure that program activities are implemented as intended. The procedures
should provide for systematic monitoring and review of ongoing programs to:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ensure that Federal, State, and local organizations coordinate impaired driving activities, so that the activities
complement rather than compete with each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Data and Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should establish and maintain records systems for accidents, arrests, dispositions, driver licenses, and
vehicle registrations. Especially important are tracking systems which can provide information on every driver
arrested for DWI to determine the disposition of the case and compliance with sanctions. These records systems should
be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should evaluate all impaired driving system activities regularly to ensure that programs are effective and
scarce resources are allocated appropriately. Evaluation should be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

Traffic Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should establish and implement a complete traffic records
program. The Statewide program should include, or provide for, data for the entire State. A complete traffic records
program is necessary for planning (problem identification), operational management or control, and evaluation
of a State's highway safety activities. This type of program is basic to identifying highway safety problems, tracking
safety trends, and implementing highway safety countermeasures. It is the key ingredient to safety effectiveness
and management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Data Characteristics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Traffic records programs should meet basic requirements for the most effective use of the data by program managers.
Accordingly, each State should emphasize the following characteristics:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An accurate identification of the crash location;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timely and accurate data collection and input to all files, and especially to the Accident and Driver Files, to assure
maximum utilization and confidence in the traffic records system. Each state is encouraged to join and fully participate
in the driver license compact to ensure that complete data is available from other states;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data uniformity, providing for uniform coding and definition of data elements to allow a State to compare its crash
problems to other States, regions and the nation; and the use of uniform coding of violations and convictions for the
efficient exchange of driver information between States;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data consistency within a State over time to provide for multi-year analysis of data to detect trends and for identification
of emerging problems, as well as to determine beneficial effects of highway safety programs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timely and complete data output to ensure that highway safety program managers will have records that are accessible,
understandable, and effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

III. Use of Traffic Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The measure of a good records system is the degree to which it is used by those it was designed to serve. Each State should
establish a process for the effective use of traffic records by highway safety management, including the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A management process which addresses the role or use of traffic records data in planning (including problem identification),
program control, and evaluation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A problem identification strategy that specifies the necessary data, assures that accurate and timely data are available,
defines the analyses conducted (including the variables used, statistical tests applied, and trends examined),
and describes how results are reported and used;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presentation of analysis results so that they are clearly understood and usable by managers, including the use of
problem reports which describe the magnitude of the problems, and appropriate graphs, tables and charts to support
the conclusions reached; and

IX. Medical Direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Physician involvement in all aspects of the patient care system is critical for effective EMS operations. EMS is a
medical care system in which physicians delegate responsibilities to non-physician providers who manage patient
care outside the traditional confines of the office or hospital. States should require physicians to be involved
in all aspects of the patient care system, including: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive pedestrian and bicycle
safety program that educates and motivates its citizens to follow safe pedestrian and bicycle practices. A combination
of legislation, regulations, policy, enforcement, public information, education, incentives, and engineering
is necessary to achieve significant, lasting improvements in pedestrian and bicycle crash rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State should recognize that its pedestrians and bicyclists_citizens of all ages who are virtually unprotected
from the forces of a crash, face major safety problems and are a valid traffic safety concern. Because of the diverse
nature of these issues, education, enforcement, and engineering are critical components to any strategies devised
to reduce these problems. In formulating policy, the State should promote these specific issues: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision of early pedestrian and bicycle safety education and training for preschool children; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in health and safety education curricula; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in driver training programs and driver licensing activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of a safe environment for pedestrians and bicyclists through such measures as sidewalks and bicycle
facilities, in the planning and design of all highway projects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of bicycle helmets as a primary measure to reduce death and injury among bicyclists; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An awareness of the role of alcohol in adult pedestrian accidents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safeguarding of older citizens from pedestrian accidents; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment and support of Community/Corridor Traffic Safety Programs at the local level. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive highway safety system is the most effective means of producing consistent, long-term changes in
knowledge and behavior necessary to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety. The following components create a structure
for identifying problem areas; implementing, measuring, and evaluating the problem areas; and directing the results
back into system improvements. We believe these elements will effectively address the problem.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should have centralized program planning, initiation, and coordination to promote pedestrian and bicycle
safety program issues as part of a comprehensive highway safety program. Evaluation is also important for determining
progress and ultimate success of pedestrian and bicycle safety programs and for providing those results to revise
existing programs and to develop new programs. The State should have program staff trained in pedestrian and bicyclist
safety so that this program can:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Conduct regular problem identification activities to identify fatality and injury crash trends for pedestrians
and bicyclists and to provide guidance in development of countermeasures,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to other State agencies and local pedestrian and bicycle
safety programs and projects;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Convene a pedestrian and bicycle safety advisory task force or coalition to organize, integrate with other involved
groups, and generate broad-based support for programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

programs, and transportation plans; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluate the effectiveness of its pedestrian and bicycle safety program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Multi-Disciplinary Involvement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pedestrian and bicyclist safety goes beyond the confines of any single State or local agency (enforcement or education)
and requires the combined support and coordinated attention of multiple agencies, representing a variety of disciplines,
at the State and local level. At a minimum, the following kinds of agencies should be involved:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Law Enforcement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Legislation and Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should enact and enforce pedestrian and bicyclist-related traffic laws and regulations. Specific policies
should be developed to encourage coordination with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and other agencies,
in the development of regulations and laws to promote pedestrian and bicyclist safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Law Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a law enforcement component.
Each State should strongly emphasize the role played by law enforcement personnel in pedestrian and bicyclist safety.
Essential components of that role include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Developing knowledge of pedestrian and bicyclist crash situations; investigating crashes; and maintaining a report
system that supports problem identification and evaluation activities;

V. Traffic Engineering
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Traffic engineering is a critical element of any crash reduction program. This is true not only for the development
of programs to reduce an existing crash problem, but also to design transportation facilities that provide for the
safe movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and all motor vehicles. Balancing the needs of pedestrians and those of
vehicular traffic (including bicycle) must always be considered. Therefore, each State should ensure that State
and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a traffic engineering component. Traffic engineering efforts
should be coordinated with enforcement and educational efforts. This effort should improve the protection of pedestrians
and bicyclists by application of appropriate traffic engineering measures in design, construction, operation,
and maintenance. These measures should include but not be limited to the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

VII. Outreach Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in pedestrian and bicycle safety education by involving
individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens
public support for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs.
To encourage community involvement, States should:

VIII. School-Based Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should incorporate pedestrian and bicycle safety education into school curricula. Safe walking and bicycle-riding
practices to and from school and school-related events are good health habits and, like other health habits, must
be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The State Department of Education and
the State Highway Safety Agency should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensure that highway safety in general, and pedestrian and bicycle safety in particular, are included in the State-approved
K&hyph;12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establish and enforce written policies requiring safe walking and bicycling practices to and from school, including
use of bicycle helmets on school property; and

IX. Driver Education and Licensing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should address pedestrian and bicycle issues in State driver education and licensing programs. Pedestrian
and bicycle safety principles and rules should be included in all driver training and licensing examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
X. Evaluation Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both evaluation and problem identification require good record keeping by the State and its political subdivisions.
The State should identify the types and frequency of pedestrian and bicyclist crash problems in terms that are relevant
to both the selection and evaluation of appropriate countermeasure programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State should promote effective evaluation of programs by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have an efficient and effective police traffic
services (PTS) program to enforce traffic laws, prevent crashes, assist the injured, document specific details
of individual crashes, supervise crash clean-up, and restore safe and orderly movement of traffic. PTS is critical
to the success of most traffic safety countermeasures. Traffic law enforcement plays an important role in deterring
drunk and drugged driving, achieving safety belt use, encouraging compliance with speed laws, and reducing other
unsafe driving actions. Experience has shown that a combination of highly visible enforcement, public information,
education, and training is necessary to achieve a significant and lasting impact in reducing crashes, injuries,
and fatalities. At a minimum, a well-balanced statewide PTS program should be made up of the components detailed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Planning and Coordination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Centralized program planning, implementation, and coordination are essential for achieving and sustaining effective
PTS programs. The State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA), in conjunction with State and local law enforcement agencies,
should ensure that these planning and coordinating functions are performed with regard to the State's traffic safety
program, since law enforcement is in most instances a principle component of that program. In carrying out its responsibility
of centralized program planning and coordination, the State should:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the SHSA, should establish PTS as a priority within
their total enforcement program. A PTS program should be built on a foundation of commitment, coordination, planning,
monitoring, and evaluation within the agency's enforcement program. State and local law enforcement agencies should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Provide the public with a high quality, effective PTS system and have enabling legislation and regulations in place
to implement PTS functions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop and implement a comprehensive enforcement plan for alcohol and drug impaired driving, safety belt use and
child passenger safety laws, speeding, and other hazardous moving violations. The plan should initiate action to
look beyond the issuance of traffic tickets to include enforcement of laws by drivers of all types of vehicles, including
trucks, automobiles, and motorcycles;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop a cooperative working relationship with other local, county, and State governmental agencies and community
organizations on traffic safety issues;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Resource Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should encourage law enforcement agencies to develop and maintain a comprehensive resource management plan
to identify and deploy resources needed to effectively support enforcement programs. The resource management plan
should include a specific component on traffic enforcement and safety, integrating traffic enforcement and safety
initiatives into a total agency enforcement program. Law enforcement agencies should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Traffic Law Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The enforcement of traffic laws and ordinances is a basic responsibility shared by all police agencies. The primary
objective of this function is to encourage motorists and pedestrians to comply voluntarily with the laws. Administrators
should apply their enforcement resources in ways that ensure the greatest safety impact. Traffic law enforcement
programs should be based on:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Countermeasures designed to address specific problems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement actions applied at appropriate times and places, coupled with a public information effort designed
to make the motoring public aware of the problem and the planned enforcement action; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A system to document and publicize results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Public Information and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Necessity of Public Information and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public awareness and knowledge about traffic enforcement are essential for sustaining increased compliance with
all traffic laws. This requires a well-organized, effectively-managed public information and education program.
The SHSA, in cooperation with law enforcement agencies, should develop a statewide public information and education
campaign that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Identifies and targets specific audiences;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addresses enforcement of safety belt use and child passenger safety, drunk and drugged driving, speed, and other
serious traffic laws;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capitalizes on special events, such as Operation C.A.R.E., Child Passenger Safety Awareness, Buckle Up, America!
and Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness weeks;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identifies and supports the efforts of traffic safety activist groups to gain increased support of and attention
to traffic safety and enforcement;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The task of public information can be divided into two interconnected areas: external and internal information.
Both areas, properly administered, will benefit the agency and work in concert to accomplish the goal of establishing
and maintaining a positive police-public relationship.

V. Data Collection and Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of valid data is critical to any approach intended to increase the level of highway safety. An effective
records program provides fast and accurate information to field personnel who are performing primary traffic functions
and to management for decision-making. Data are usually collected from crash reports, daily officer activity reports
that contain workload and citation information, highway department records (

Speed Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have, as part of a comprehensive highway safety
program, an effective speed control program that encourages its citizens to voluntarily comply with speed limits.
The program should stress systematic and rational establishment of speed limits, a law enforcement commitment to
controlling speed on all public roads, a commitment to utilize both traditional methods and state-of-the art equipment
in setting and enforcing speed limits, and a strong public information and education program aimed at increasing
driver compliance with speed limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local law enforcement agencies, transportation departments, and the State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA)
should establish speed control as a priority within their total highway safety program. The speed control program
should contain the following elements: program management, procedures for establishing reasonable speed limits,
coordinated enforcement efforts, public information and education, identification and utilization of new technology,
legislative coordination and commitment, training, and evaluation. When planning and developing a program to address
speed control, the issue of speed should be examined in light of the empirical data available, current methods for
setting speed limits, and the current public perception of speed compliance. Added to these elements is the law enforcement
response, including the resources available to enforcement agencies. Only after these components have been examined
and defined can the goals of a speed control program be formulated. In carrying out its responsibility of centralized
program planning and coordination, the State should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Develop and implement a comprehensive speed control plan in cooperation with law enforcement leaders, traffic engineers,
educators, and leaders of the community;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies and highway/traffic
agencies;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generate broad based support for speed control programs through education on the scope and severity of the problem;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Integrate speed control into the overall traffic enforcement and engineering program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Enforcement Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should strongly emphasize speed enforcement as part of its overall traffic enforcement program. The speed
enforcement program should include enforcement strategies and other components of a comprehensive approach to
address the speed issue. The plan should address the following concepts:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Including public information and education components along with vigorous enforcement in State and local anti-speeding
programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collecting data to help in problem identification and evaluation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identifying high risk crash locations where speed is a contributing factor in crashes;

V. Technology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New and updated technology for speed measurement is needed to determine appropriated speed limits for a variety of
conditions and to provide maximum enforcement activity with fewer available resources. Current technology for
measuring speed, such as loop detectors, should be used not only to establish viable speed limits but also to vary speed
limits to conform to existing conditions. State and local governments should only utilize speed measurement equipment
for enforcement that is approved or recognized as reliable and accurate. All law enforcement agencies should use
the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) regional testing laboratories to ensure that equipment
used to measure speeds meets minimum standards. For CMV enforcement purposes, the FHWA will provide MCSAP funding
only for those items of speed control equipment approved by the ICAP or which meet other suitable standards. The SHSA,
in conjunction with law enforcement and traffic/highway agencies, should support programs providing for:

Police Radar Model Minimum Specifications_NHTSA, in cooperation with the IACP and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), has developed model specifications and testing protocols for police traffic radar. Using
these model specification, IACP in cooperation with radar manufacturers and NHTSA, has established a program to
test radar sets that are available for purchase by law enforcement agencies. Reports of the testing were published
by IACP along with a Consumer Products List which provides law enforcement agencies with the names of radar sets conforming
with the model performance specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Police Radar Testing Program_To ensure that law enforcement agencies can continue to purchase and operate accurate
radar devices, IACP, in cooperation with radar manufacturers and NHTSA, has established an ongoing process of performance
testing for newly developed devices and for maintaining existing equipment. Testing laboratories have been established
at five universities. These laboratories will continue the testing program and will provide services to the law enforcement
community.

VI. Child Passenger Safety Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should vigorously promote the use of child safety seats. States should require every child up to 40 pounds
to ride correctly secured in a child safety seat that meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (see Program Component
II: Legislation, Regulation, and Policy). State and community child passenger safety programs that will help to
achieve that objective should be established to: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Educate parents, pediatricians, hospitals, law enforcement, EMS and the general public about the safety risks to
small children, the benefits of child safety seats, and their responsibilities for compliance with child passenger
safety laws; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Encourage child safety seat retailers and auto dealers to provide information about child seat and vehicle compatibility,
as well as correct use; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Require safe child transportation policies for certification of pre-school and day care providers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Require hospitals to ensure that newborn and other small children are correctly secured in an approved child safety
seat or safety belt upon discharge; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make child safety seats available at affordable cost to low-income families; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Encourage local law enforcement to vigorously enforce child passenger safety laws, including safety belt use laws
as they apply to children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. School-Based Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should incorporate occupant protection education in school curricula. Buckling up is a good health habit
and, like other health habits, must be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The
State Department of Education and the State Highway Safety Agency should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensure that highway safety in general, and occupant protection in particular, are included in the State-approved
K&hyph;12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establish and enforce written policies requiring that school employees operating a motor vehicle on the job use safety
belts; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Encourage active promotion of regular safety belt use through classroom and extra-curricular activities as well
as in the school-based health clinics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Worksite Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should encourage all employers to require safety belt use on the job as a condition of employment. The Federal
government has already taken that step for its employees. Private sector employers should follow the lead of Federal
and State government employers and comply with all applicable FHWA Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or Occupational
Health and Safety (OSHA) regulations requiring private business employees to use safety belts on the job. All employers
should:

Establish and enforce a safety belt use policy with sanctions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conduct occupant protection education programs for employees on their belt use policies and the safety benefits
of motor vehicle occupant protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Outreach Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in occupant protection education by involving individuals
and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens public support
for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs. To encourage
community involvement, States should:

Roadway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive roadway safety program
that is directed toward reducing the number and severity of traffic crashes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides administrative oversight for the Roadway Safety portion of
the section 402 highway safety program in close coordination with the State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA) and the State
Highway Agency (SHA). Although section 402 dollars cannot be utilized for highway construction, maintenance or
design activities, they can be used to develop and implement systems and procedures for carrying out safety construction
and operational improvements. These funds can also be used to augment Federal-aid highway programs, such as the Hazard
Elimination Program (Section 152) and the Rail-Highway Crossings Programs (Section 130), as well as other safety
construction activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective Roadway Safety program is based on sound analyses of roadway-related crash information and applies
engineering principles in identifying highway design or operational improvements that will address the crash problem.
The SHSA should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Assign program staff to work directly with the FHWA division safety engineer on roadway-related safety programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work in close harmony with the SHA, particularly with SHA staff who are responsible for traffic engineering, pedestrian
and bicycle programs, CMV safety, rail-highway crossing safety issues, work zone safety, design and operational
improvements, and hazardous roadway locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foster an ongoing dialogue among all disciplines with a vested interest in highway safety, including engineers,
enforcement personnel, traffic safety specialists, driver licensing administrators, CMV safety specialists,
and data specialists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Promote a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing highway safety issues which focuses on comprehensive solutions
to identified problems. An example is assisting in the coordination and the implementation of Community/Corridor
Traffic Safety Programs, and MCSAP, where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Become familiar with the various highway-safety related categories of Federal-aid highway funds_in addition to
section 402_in order to maximize the safety benefits of the entire program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Become familiar with the State's traffic records system and play a role in the system's ongoing operation, maintenance
and enhancement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assist community leaders in managing and/or coordinating programs designed to address roadway safety issues and
concerns which fall under the jurisdiction of local communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Become familiar with MCSAP and coordinate MCSAP and section 402 program activities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was signed into law December 18, 1991. Section
2002(a) of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six key
areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to congress describing the reasons for not prioritizing
these programs. The six program areas involve: Speed control, Use of occupant protection devices, Driving while
impaired, Motorcycle safety, School Bus Safety, and Police Traffic Services. The existing National Priority Program
Areas address four of the six areas identified by the Act, but do not include Speed Control or School Bus Safety. The
agencies have reviewed existing data and statistics regarding deaths and injuries attributable to these two areas
and have considered the availability of existing countermeasures related to speed control and school bus safety,
and tentatively propose to include Speed Control as a Priority Program Area, but have tentatively concluded that
School Bus Safety does not warrant being included as a Priority Program. Interested persons are invited to submit
comments on this proposal.

Background

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (the 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety Act
of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs
to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen such standards were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA
is responsible for developing and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver, while
FHWA has similar responsibilities in program areas involving the roadway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 Highway
Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for noncompliance.
Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the
Secretary would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform
standard. As a result, the standards became more like guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program then
shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem identification, and countermeasure development and evaluation,
using the standards as a framework for the State programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Public Law 97&hyph;35, revising the section
402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety
programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority Program Areas
which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included
one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas:
Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic
Records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority Program Areas would be eligible for Federal funding
under an expedited procedure under the 402 program (23 CFR 1205.4.). It also established a mechanism by which other,
non-priority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. (23 CFR 1205.5 (a) and (b).)

Periodic Review and Determination of Priority Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various
programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review
procedure was believed to be the best method of ensuring the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing
circumstances and traffic safety needs, and for ensuring that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation also provided that the terms ``standard'' and ``standards'' within 23 CFR Part 1204 be replaced with
the words ``guideline'' and ``guidelines.'' The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section
402 to the current implementation of the programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective
in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988, (53 FR 1255) the agencies determined
that the National Priority Program Areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly,
Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in
1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should also be included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 3, 1991, NHTSA/FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as one
of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and resulted in the addition
of that area as one of the National Priority Program Areas eligible for the expedited funding process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of these prior rulemaking actions, the National Priority Program Areas currently include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Alcohol and Other Drug Countermeasures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Roadway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies apply three criteria to determine whether a program area should be identified as a National Priority
Program under 23 CFR Part 1205:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the problem is of national concern; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether effective countermeasures have been developed in this area which address this concern; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether State programs in the area appear to be among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and
fatalities as compared to other traffic safety program areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether a problem is of national concern, the agencies consider the relative magnitude of the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's notice is being issued to solicit comments on a proposal of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to expand this list of National Priority Program Areas to include
Speed Control, and to obtain comments on the agencies' preliminary determination that School Bus Safety should not
be added as a National Priority Program Area at this time. The agencies have considered relevant data, statistics,
and other available information in reaching this conclusion and now seek public comments from interested parties
on these tentative determinations. The following discussion highlights the key issues and factors considered by
the agencies in making these preliminary determinations. (In a separate notice published elsewhere in this issue
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Is Speeding a Problem of National Concern?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA and FHWA. Over the course of the agencies'
history, we have funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Speeding is defined as
not only exceeding the posted speed limit, but also driving too fast for conditions. Some common conclusions from
these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling
in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists.

Speeding is Becoming More Prevalent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While many speed/traffic surveys are taken, reliable data on travel speed are relatively limited, and often difficult
to compare. The most reliable speed data are those reported by the States for National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL) roadways
posted at 55 mph. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publishes an annual report containing a compendium of
speed monitoring data submitted by each State. Analyses of recent speed monitoring data by the FHWA indicate that
speeds at which many motorists travel have increased in recent years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are less comprehensive data collected for roadways which have speed limits of less than 55 mph, including the
many rural highways and urban/suburban streets and roads which are posted at lower speeds for reasons of road design,
traffic patterns, volume, and safety. These non-NMSL roads account for 74 percent of the total paved road mileage
in the U.S. and for approximately 47 percent of all traffic deaths. The lack of empirical data makes it difficult to
identify the extent of the speeding problem on these non-NMSL roads. A recent FHWA study of these roads entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment of Current Speed Zoning Criteria 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
found that: (1) On average, seven out of ten motorists exceeded posted limits; (2) average speeds ran approximately
two to six mph above posted limits; and (3) prevailing 85th percentile speeds ran approximately eight to twelve mph
above posted limits. The observations of law enforcement executives and other highway safety officials confirm
that speeds are increasing on these roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed surveys on the Interstate highways also show that average speeds and the percent of traffic travelling at high
speeds have also increased on these roads. For example, the percent of vehicles exceeding 65 mph (on roadways with
a 65 mph speed limit) were estimated to be 47 percent in 1990 (up from 37% in 1988) while those exceeding 70 mph accounted
for approximately 19 percent (up from approximately 16 percent in 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After Congress amended the NMSL in 1987 to permit 20 States to increase the speed limit to 65 mph on rural interstates
as a demonstration program, NHTSA issued a detailed report on the effects of the increase. This interim report indicated
that average speeds increased somewhat on rural interstates. The latest NMSL research, contained in the agency's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report to Congress on the Effects of the 65 mph Speed Limit through 1990 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(NHTSA, May 1992), shows the average travel speed on rural 65 mph Interstates in 1990 was 65 mph (up from 63 mph in 1988);
the 85th percentile speed was 71 mph (up from 69 mph in 1988); and fatalities on rural interstates were an estimated
30 percent higher in 1990 than the number expected, based on historical trends, had the speed limit remained at 55 mph.
A series of focus group discussions held by NHTSA with the general public suggest that most drivers recognize speeding
as a violation of the law, but few regard the violation as a serious offense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies all suggest that the motoring public does not view speeding per se as an immediate risk to their personal
safety.

Excessive Speed Causes Crashes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated with crashes. Studies identify correlations between
speeding and other factors including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists, and nighttime
driving. Speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all police-reported crashes and
in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System, 1991). It is estimated
that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,277 moderate to critical injuries occurred in speed-related crashes. The
economic cost of all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels) was over $18 billion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excessive speed has long been recognized as one of the prime factors contributing to motor vehicle crashes. This contribution
has several sources:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drivers have less time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle
travels during the time it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt a vehicle; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways, or objects in the roadway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major speed-related factor which has been linked to crash involvement is speed variance: The difference in speed
among vehicles in the traffic stream. Speed variance is calculated in terms of standard deviation from the mean speed.
For example, ten vehicles all traveling at 55 mph on the same highway would have a mean speed of 55 mph and a standard deviation
of zero, whereas five vehicles traveling at 65 mph and five vehicles traveling at 45 mph would have a mean speed of 55
mph but a standard deviation of 10.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research studies such as those in 55: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A Decade of Experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Transportation Research Board, 1984) have shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance
is greater. As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently. This leads to more frequent
lane changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower vehicles. Data from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Crash Severity Study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1979) show that vehicles travelling 20 mph above the average speed experience a crash risk 11 times greater than those
travelling at the average speed. This data implies that crashes can be reduced by controlling speed variance. Controlling
speed variance is especially critical on roadways with speed limits less than 65 mph, where conflicting actions and
reactions typically cause much larger variations in speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Speed Increases the Severity of Crashes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The trend toward increased speeds is cause for concern because of the reduced margin for error and the increase in severity
for those vehicles involved in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy
of the impact delivered in a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen. The chance of death or serious
injury increases dramatically for every 10 mph increase in vehicle speed for the crash involved vehicle. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Crash Severity Study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NHTSA, 1979) revealed that a driver crashing with a 50 mph change in velocity is twice as likely to be killed as one crashing
with a 40 mph change in velocity. In short, crashes at higher speeds increase the potential for more deaths and disabling
injuries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Have Effective Speed Control Countermeasures Been Developed?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Enforcement personnel have several effective countermeasures available for speed control which have been developed
by new technology. Traditional methods of speed control once involved the use of stopwatches and pneumatic hoses
stretched across the roadway to determine vehicle speeds. Later developments included the introduction of radar
and VASCAR which more precisely measured vehicle speeds and reduced the degree of possible operator error. Currently
laser speed measuring devices with an extremely high degree of accuracy are becoming available to the law enforcement
community.NHTSA has taken an active role in identifying and evaluating new law enforcement technology. After evaluating
new devices, NHTSA has established demonstration programs to introduce those devices into the law enforcement community
to further advance speed control efforts. These demonstration programs have included enforcing speed limits using
radar, VASCAR, laser speed measuring devices, aerial speed measurement, photo radar, electronic signing and saturation
patrols.NHTSA studies show that one of the best methods to obtain compliance with speed limits is to combine an aggressive
enforcement campaign with a vigorous public information and education effort. Public service announcements (PSA)
regarding speed are regularly developed and distributed by NHTSA. Furthermore, other effective countermeasures,
such as saturation patrols and multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional enforcement efforts, have been developed and
furnished to the law enforcement community. These programs can easily become a part of an agency's traffic enforcement
program.Several highway design and traffic control measures have also demonstrated effectiveness for speed control.
Freeway design, culminating in the Interstate System, eliminated all at-grade intersections thus providing for
free flow traffic. This singular design characteristic resulted in significant reduction in speed variance and
the promotion of uniform operating speed. Speed variances on the Interstate System have traditionally been in the
range of 6&hyph;9 miles per hour while speed variances on non-freeway facilities can be as great as 20 miles per hour.In
addition, the need to control speed for varying conditions has led to the development of variable message speed signs.
These devices, first used on the New Jersey Turnpike in the late 1960's have had widespread implementation on all types
of facilities and warn drivers of impeding congestion, weather conditions, construction, and incidents which required
reduction in operating speed. Real time regulatory variable speed limits are now being tested in the State of Washington.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies believe that Federal, State, and local governments should have balanced programs that use the most cost-effective
strategies for decreasing crash risks from speeding. This includes: (1) Targeting enforcement where speeding has
a significant impact on public safety and accompanying it with public information and education; (2) using a variety
of techniques and technologies for speed control; (3) understanding who speeds, where, and why; and (4) ensuring
that posted speed limits are appropriate for conditions. These efforts can be further enhanced through the development
of comprehensive speed control programs which include establishment of appropriate criteria for the setting and
posting of speed limits, focused attention upon roadway construction and condition, posting of appropriate roadway
signs, elimination of hazards adjacent to the roadway, and establishment of research projects to further study the
characteristics and consequences of speeding in order to develop improved countermeasures and guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA submitted a report to Congress in 1991 entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speed Enforcement Program Plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to identify methods to address the speeding problem. The plan relies heavily upon programs and projects that have
proven to be most effective and outlines speed control initiatives that have proven successful. The plan also stresses
a law enforcement commitment to controlling speed on all public roads, using state-of-the-art equipment, with a
strong emphasis on public information and education designed to increase driver compliance with speed limits.

Are State Speed Control Programs Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control countermeasures are extremely
effective in reducing deaths and injuries. For example, the New York State Police 55 mph enforcement project was successful
in decreasing the number of drivers traveling at the highest rates of speed (often considered to be ``professional
speeders''). While average speed declined slightly from 61.6 to 61.3 mph, the percent of drivers exceeding 70 mph
declined from 6.9% to 5.1%. The percent exceeding 65 mph declined from 24.1% to 21.4%, and the percent exceeding 60
mph declined from 56.4% to 55.7%. This success is believed to have ultimately led to reductions in the number of fatal
crashes, fatalities and serious injuries suffered in New York.

In South Carolina, it is believed that the state's rural initiative involving sheriffs contributed to a significant
reduction in crashes, injuries, and fatalities in 1991 as compared to 1989. During that period, the state experienced
12,472 fewer crashes, 2,331 fewer injuries and 106 fewer fatalities. South Carolina's PSA campaign also received
widespread recognition from across the State and is believed to have contributed to the reduction of crashes during
the time the campaign was operational.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of the St. Louis enforcement operation, ending September 1991, the average speed dropped from
62 mph to 61 mph on the 55 mph roadways in the metro area, as a result of the police agencies issuing 3,698 citations and
5,600 warnings for speeding during the Operation Gateway period. This cooperative program is continuing and is expected
to result in further speed decreases on the involved roadways in the metro St. Louis area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the speed control efforts targeting commercial vehicles appear to be effective, with early results from
the 1987 Commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement project in California indicating that all crashes where commercial
vehicles were at fault decreased by 3.5% (from 810 in 1986 to 782 in 1987) in the five test sites throughout the State.
Further, the number of accidents caused by commercial vehicles which resulted in injuries in these test sites also
declined by 11.2% (from 259 in 1986 to 230 in 1987). Accompanying that reduction was a corresponding decrease in the
societal cost of injuries and fatalities resulting from such crashes.

Determination Regarding Speed Control

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies believe it is clear that excessive speed does represent a significant traffic safety problem. Speeding
is a problem throughout the country in all regions and on all types of roads. Numerous countermeasures have been developed
that have proven to be most effective in addressing this problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies, therefore, tentatively conclude that Speed Control meets all requisite criteria and propose to include
it as a National Priority Program Area.

The safety of children in school buses has been a primary concern of parents and school systems ever since buses began
to be used to transport children. That concern has helped develop school buses into the safest form of transportation
in the country. According to the National Safety Council's ``Accident Facts'' (1991), during the 1989&hyph;90 school
year, it is estimated that 380,000 buses were used to transport 22 million pupils approximately 3.8 billion miles
(21 million miles per school day). The National Safety Council statistics also indicate fatality rates per hundred
million passenger miles in 1989 were 1.12 for passenger cars and 0.04 for school buses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relative safety of school buses is evident from the following table, which shows all vehicle occupant fatalities.
Included are the number of preschool (0&hyph;4) and school-age children (5&hyph;18) who were fatally injured in
motor vehicle crashes in 1990, and the type of vehicle in which they were riding at the time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
School bus-related crashes result in fatalities not only to occupants of school buses and other vehicles, but also
to pedestrians. Pedestrians accounted for 28 percent of the total school bus-related fatalities from 1986 through
1990. In crashes involving school buses during that period, an average of 38 pedestrians were fatally injured each
year, with 72 percent being struck by the bus, while the remaining 28 percent were struck by another vehicle. Approximately
75 percent of pedestrian fatalities involving school buses from 1986&hyph;1990 were of school age (less than 20 years
of age); of these, approximately 69 percent were struck by the bus.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Safety Council reports that during the 1989&hyph;1990 school year, most of these pedestrian fatalities
involved individuals who were either approaching or leaving a loading zone and that more than half of the pupil pedestrian
victims were struck by the school bus which they were boarding or exiting. The National Academy of Science's Special
Report No. 222, ``School Bus Safety,'' (1989) states that injuries received at bus stops tend to be more severe than
injuries received on board a bus. The report also states that, as pedestrians, children between the ages of five and
six are particularly vulnerable and account for more than one-half of the young pedestrians fatally injured by school
buses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
School bus crashes have a much different effect on the population as a whole than automobile crashes. When a child is
fatally injured in a school bus crash there is a greater sense of loss and a greater sense of tragedy. For this reason,
school bus fatalities and crashes often receive a high degree of public attention and draw an immediate and passionate
response from the community. However, the number of fatalities in school bus crashes is small, particularly when
considering exposure and when compared to the number of fatalities related to other priority programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, passenger cars were involved in 82.8 percent of all traffic crashes and 67.9 percent of all fatal crashes;
whereas school buses were involved in only 0.4 percent of all traffic crashes and in 0.3 percent of all fatal crashes.
These data demonstrate that the safety problem related to school buses is not great when compared to that of other types
of vehicles.

Have Effective School Bus Safety Measures Been Developed?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although statistics demonstrate that school buses already provide a remarkably safe form of transportation, the
agency has taken steps to further improve school bus safety. At the request of Congress, the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) studied school bus safety to determine which safety measures would be ``most effective'' in protecting school
children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses. (See, ``Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation
Assistance Act of 1987,'' Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, 204(a), 101 Stat. 219, April 2, 1987.) In May 1989, the National Research
Council (NRC), an agency of the NAS, issued a report entitled ``Improving School Bus Safety,'' Special Report No.
222. The report confirmed the high level of safety provided by the Nation's school bus fleet, and also suggested measures
that could further improve the safety of school buses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the 1987 law, NHTSA reviewed the findings of the NAS report and, on July 13, 1989, published a notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 29629), in which the agency determined which safety measures would be most effective in protecting the safety
of school children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA found replacing pre-1977 school buses to be a ``most effective'' measure, because of the higher level of crashworthiness
provided by NHTSA's 1977 school bus standards, the improved mirror systems, and other crash avoidance measures typically
provided on newer school buses. The agency also found prohibiting standees on school buses to be a ``most effective''
measure. In addition, NHTSA found a number of measures which address the safety of children while boarding or exiting
the bus to be ``most effective.'' They include equipping new buses with stop signal arms and cross-view mirrors and
implementing student crossing, pedestrian safety education and school bus driver training programs. NHTSA also
identified a number of measures as ``effective.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency took several steps to encourage the adoption of these ``effective'' and ``most effective'' measures.
In FY's 1990 and 1991, NHTSA set aside, in accordance with provisions in the Highway Safety Act of 1987 (Title II, Pub.
L. 100&hyph;17), funds to assist the States in implementing these school bus safety measures. The funds were used
by States on measures that had been designated by NHTSA to be either ``effective'' or ``most effective'' in improving
school bus safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NHTSA conducted a number of rulemaking actions to upgrade the agency's school bus safety standards.
For example, NHTSA issued a final rule on May 3, 1991, requiring new school buses manufactured after September 1, 1992,
to be equipped with a stop signal arm (56 FR 20363); a final rule on November 2, 1992, revising the minimum requirements
for school bus emergency exits and improving access to school bus emergency doors (57 FR 49413); and a final rule on
December 2, 1992, requiring that school buses enable drivers to see, either directly or through mirrors, certain
specified areas in front of and along both sides of the buses (57 FR 57000).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as stated previously, in a final rule dated October 4, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA expanded the list of National Priority
programs areas, which are eligible for section 402 funding using an expedited process, to include Pedestrian and
Bicycle Safety. The agencies considered the problem of school bus-related pedestrian fatalities when they decided
to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety to the list of priority programs, and specifically stated, in the final rule,
that programs designed to prevent these fatalities are within the scope of this new priority program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Are These School Bus Safety Measures Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, school buses already provide the safest form of transportation in our country. Since the number
of fatalities that are school bus-related is already so small, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of the actions
that have been taken. The agencies believe, however, that these measures are the ones most likely to reduce or eliminate
fatal and serious injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Determination Regarding School Bus Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the agencies' review of the available material regarding the scope of the problem, including FHWA studies
regarding bus driver training and driver fatigue, we have determined that significant attention has been devoted
to school bus safety, and steps have been taken to improve the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the successful measures already taken, the agencies do not view school bus transportation as a problem nearly
as significant as other highway safety program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the section 402 program to address school bus and other highway
safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety
benefits. In addition, the recent designation of Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as a National Priority program area
has facilitated the States' ability to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur while
children are boarding or existing, not riding the bus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that the establishment of School Bus Safety as a priority area could result in States shifting
402 funds away from other priority programs, and that the expenditure of an increased level of 402 funds in this manner
would not significantly affect the overall safety of school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agencies tentatively conclude that School Bus Safety should not be included as a National Priority
program at this time. The agencies wish to stress that this tentative decision should not be construed to imply that
the current resources focused upon School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected. NHTSA and FHWA believe that
all existing efforts in this area should be continued to maintain the impressive safety record associated with school
bus transportation. The agencies hereby request data, statistics, and other substantive information relevant
to this determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those wishing to comment on this document should limit comments to the safety aspects of these two programs, and submit
data or statistics which demonstrate the extent of the nation's highway safety problem which is attributable to either
Speeding or School Bus Safety, along with any discussion of countermeasures which are or could be effective in reducing
the number of deaths and injuries in either of these two areas. In determining whether these programs should be identified
as National Priority Programs, the agencies will determine whether the problem is of national concern; whether effective
countermeasures have been developed to address the concern; and whether State programs appear to be among the most
effective as compared to other traffic safety program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite the submission of comments, simultaneous with issuance of this notice, copies of this notice
will be mailed to all Governors and Governors' Representatives for Highway Safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments should not exceed 15 pages in length. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. Necessary
attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended
to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received before the closing date indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examination
in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the
closing date will also be considered. However, the rulemaking action may proceed at any time after that date. The agencies
will continue to file relevant material in the docket as it becomes available after the closing date, and it is recommended
that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies have considered the impacts that would be associated with this proposed action, and determined that
it is significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures since
it raises policy issues concerning the setting of priority programs. This rulemaking document was reviewed under
E.O. 12866. The rulemaking would not affect the level of funding available in the highway safety program, or otherwise
have a significant economic impact. The agency has prepared a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation which is available
in the docket.

This document reopens and extends the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking published on August 12,
1993 (58 FR 42918). This action is being taken because the Department was unable to publish the final rule before the
end of Fiscal Year 1993 and the Buy American requirements were again included in the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994. Pursuant
to these statutory provisions, the Department proposes to extend the requirements to Fiscal Year 1994, under the
same terms as set forth in the August 12, 1993 document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 5, 1992, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (``the
Act'') was signed into law. Section 319 of the Act was entitled ``Buy American Requirements.'' The section applied
to funds appropriated or transferred pursuant to the Act for the purchase of any equipment or product that may have
been authorized to be purchased with financial assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 319(b)(2) required that in providing financial assistance under the Act, the Secretary shall provide to
each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the Buy American requirement. No other specific Congressional
guidance was given regarding the implementation of this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposed to revise 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart E to implement these requirements. Since no specific
guidance was provided by Congress, the Department decided to base its implementation upon similar rules in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;138, the ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994,'' and
Public Law 103&hyph;126, the ``Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994,'' extend the Buy American
requirements to awards of financial assistance under the Department's general appropriation for Fiscal Year 1994,
as well as to similar awards by the Bureau of Reclamation. Because the statutes change no other portions of the Buy American
requirements, and because the Department was unable to issue a final rule prior to the enactment of the two statutes,
the Department now proposes to issue a final rule based on the proposed rule published on August 12, 1993. No other significant
changes are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one public comment was received in response to the publication of the proposed rule. This action will allow for
the receipt of more comments to be considered prior to the publication of the final rule.

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Omak Community Broadcasters proposing the allotment of Channel
282C2 to Omak, Washington, as that community's second local FM transmission service. Channel 282C2 can be allotted
to Omak in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of
16.5 kilometers (10.2 miles) south to avoid short-spacings to vacant allotment 281B, Trail, British Columbia and
Station KAFE, Channel 282C, Bellingham, Washington. The coordinates for Channel 282C2 at Omak are North Latitude
48&hyph;15&hyph;44 and West Longitude 119&hyph;31&hyph;58. Since Omak is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles)
of the U.S.-Canadian border, Canadian concurrence has been requested.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice invites written comments on a proposed revision which expresses GSA's expectation that offerors under
GSA procurements, in submitting required subcontracting plans, will do more than merely restate minimum plan requirements
described at FAR 52.219&hyph;9. GSA also expects subcontracting plans to demonstrate aggressiveness, creativity,
and innovation in involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in subcontracting
opportunities and an understanding of the requirement that these concerns be afforded the maximum practicable opportunity
to perform as subcontractors in the offeror's procurements. In negotiated solicitations, the subcontracting plan
will be negotiated with price and any technical and management proposal required by the solicitation. In sealed bid
solicitations, target goals may be stated by GSA in the solicitation. GSA understands, however, that offerors' subcontracting
circumstances may vary greatly. The proposed revision also deletes various sections because they concern nonregulatory
material.

et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

since the revised subcontracting plan requirements in the proposed regulation will not apply to small business concerns.
Accordingly, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.

The retitled provision at 552.219&hyph;73 contains an information collection requirement that is subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and it has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection may be submitted
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503.
The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.219&hyph;73 Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of
Subcontracting Plans.'' The provision requires all offerors, other than small business concerns, responding to
a negotiated solicitation to submit a subcontracting plan with their respective offers so that a plan can be negotiated
concurrently with other parts of the proposal. The respondents are potential GSA contractors. The contracting officer
will use the information to evaluate whether GSA's expectation that subcontracting opportunities exist for small,
small disadvantaged and women-owned small business is reasonable under the circumstances; negotiate goals consistent
with statutory requirements and acquisition objectives; and expedite the award process. The estimated annual burden
for this additional collection is 14,690 hours. This is based on an estimated burden per response of 11.3 hours, a proposed
frequency of one response per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents of 1,300.

The requirement at FAR 19.702(a)(1) for submission of a subcontracting plan by only the apparently successful offeror
does not apply to GSA negotiated solicitations when the contract is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction).
Except for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures and those offering minimal
subcontracting opportunities, negotiated solicitations shall require submission with the initial offer of a subcontracting
plan in the format described in FAR 52.219&hyph;9 by all offerors that are not small business concerns. Where price
is the basis for award, such as multiple award schedule contracts, the plan will be evaluated and negotiated along
with price. In solicitations requiring technical and management proposals, the subcontracting plan will be included
as an evaluation factor or subfactor and negotiated concurrently with the technical, management, and price proposals.

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided
to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this
contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to
FAR 52.219&hyph;9 to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before
being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that
its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned
small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

(a) An offeror, other than a small business concern, submitting an offer that exceeds $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)
shall submit a subcontracting plan with its initial offer. The subcontracting plan will be negotiated concurrently
with price and any required technical and management proposals, unless the offeror submits a previously-approved
commercial products plan. Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small
business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. It is
the General Services Administration's (GSA's) expectation that an offeror's subcontracting plan will reflect
a commitment to assuring that small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns are provided
the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors
in the performance of the resulting contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, in addressing the eleven elements described
at FAR 52.219&hyph;9(d), the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program
for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the contract.
The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in any previous
contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally,
the offeror shall demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's
objectives, GSA's expectations, and actions necessary to meet these goals and expectations.

program's objectives and GSA's expectations with the respect to the program and has included all the information,
goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219&hyph;9;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry;

potential for subcontracting to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Review, when applicable, the offeror's description of its strategies, historical performance and significant
achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, small disadvantaged,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) served June 4, 1993, and published at 58 FR 32340, June 9, 1993, the Commission
instituted this proceeding to determine whether off-bill discounting where it does or may result in a misrepresentation
of shipping charges should be found to be an unreasonable practice or otherwise unlawful. However, the ``Negotiated
Rates Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;180), since has been enacted and amends subchapter IV of chapter 107 of title
49, United States Code, by adding section 10767. Section 10767 requires that the Commission establish regulations
to prohibit, except for certain services, motor common and contract carriers of property from providing a reduction
in a tariff rate or contract rate to a person who is a nonpayer of freight charges. The Commission must issue these regulations
by April 2, 1994. Because section 10767 supersedes the NPR, the Commission is discontinuing this proceeding.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS announces the intention of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) to prepare
an SEIS for proposed Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South
Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Councils and approved and implemented by the Secretary of Commerce under
provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The purpose of Amendment 2 is
to manage the harvest of ``live rock,'' living marine organisms attached to a hard substrate, such as dead coral or
rock, and used primarily in the marine aquarium trade. Management measures under consideration include a prohibition
on, or phase-out of, harvest of live rock with possible provisions for aquaculture; establishment of an annual quota
or limited access management program; and implementation of a permitting system for wild harvest or aquaculture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Councils intend to conduct a continuing public process to determine the scope of issues to be addressed and to identify
the significant issues related to live rock management. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of this ongoing
process and of the opportunity to participate by submitting written comments.

that live rock harvest (i.e., the collection of rocks with marine organisms attached for use in home aquariums) was
detrimental to the Florida Reef Tract and other hard bottom habitat areas. The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission
(FMFC) noted that the only current net production of the carbonate substrate underlying live rock occurs on living
coral reefs and, in Florida, these areas are either in equilibrium or eroding. FDNR personnel testified that more
than 90 percent of the live rock examined at the request of enforcement agents contained visible colonies of prohibited
corals, such as stony corals and sea fans. The FMFC concluded that live rock removal (1) can violate State and Federal
laws that prohibit taking of corals, (2) reduces the surface area and topographic complexity of Florida's coral reefs
and other live bottom areas, and (3) removes entire micro- communities along with targeted aquarium species. As a
result of these consideration, Florida prohibited live rock landings from State waters in May 1989. As a result of
this rulemaking, live rock harvesting efforts shifted to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Florida.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMFC has noted that in 1991 approximately 35 individuals reported combined landings of about 300 tons of live rock
from EEZ waters adjacent to the Florida Reef Tract, Florida's east coast reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico hard bottom areas.
In 1992, reported Florida landings from the EEZ totalled about 400 tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Councils have discussed the live rock issue, particularly pertaining to EEZ waters over recent years,
they took no regulatory action since the FMFC had decided to initiate rulemaking regarding live rock landings from
the EEZ off Florida. Specifically, the Councils deferred action since Florida's planned phase-out of live rock landings
appeared to address what seemed to be a Florida area management issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992, the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved the FMFC rule to phase-out live rock landings in Florida from
the EEZ over a 3-year period ending on June 30, 1995. The phase-out was designed to allow development of live rock aquaculture
which would be exempt from the eventual total harvest ban. The phase-out was to be accomplished by a 25 percent annual
reduction in allowable landings (based on the 1991 reported landings) accompanied by a 500 pound daily vessel limit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1993, a U.S. District Court Judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of Florida's
quota and vessel landing limits relating to possession or landing of live rock taken in the EEZ. Florida live rock fishermen
argued that the Magnuson Act superseded State landing laws and the Councils had made ``an affirmative and conscious
decision'' not to prohibit the taking of live rock in the EEZ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the District Court action, the Councils are now concerned that removal of live rock from the EEZ is currently
unregulated. Also, there is a growing interest in harvest of live rock from North Carolina to Alabama. In April 1993,
the South Atlantic Council approved a motion to include live rock in the FMP and reactivate the Coral Advisory Panel.
In May 1993, the Gulf Council, on being advised of recent live rock landings in Alabama, and at the request of that State
and Florida, initiated development of options for live rock management. In June 1993, the South Atlantic Council
held a public scoping meeting in Duck Key, Florida, to solicit input from the harvesters and the general public on the
management of live rock. In November 1993, the Councils prepared a draft Amendment 2 to the FMP to address live rock
issues, and established a schedule for further public hearings. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The South Atlantic Council's Habitat and Environmental Protection Committee prefers a prohibition on harvest and
possession of live rock on implementation of Amendment 2, possibly as early as 1994. The Gulf Council prefers to allow
three years of continued harvest after implementation of Amendment 2 to allow additional time for harvesters to convert
to aquaculture; subsequently, harvest and possession of live rock would be limited to persons with aquaculture permits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 To improve the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for grantees the procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and requirements of the Department, the Secretary is proposing to revise sections in the Education Department General
Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) on indirect cost rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of problems in this area of grants administration will be addressed by the proposed changes. For example,
the use of a restricted indirect cost rate for programs with supplement-not-supplant language in their authorizing
statutes is required by current regulations. However, State education agencies have incurred significant financial
liabilities by using incorrect restricted indirect cost rates. The proposed changes clarify how these rates are
calculated and so will reduce the likelihood of those errors recurring. In addition, the term ``occupancy and space
maintenance costs'' as used in the computation of restricted indirect cost rates has not been clearly defined, resulting
in grant recipients being reimbursed improperly for space costs. The inclusion of a definition in these proposed
regulations will address this problem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The absence of a training grant definition has led to disagreements between the Department and grant recipients over
whether the training rate of eight percent, which is a lower rate than most recipients' negotiated rate, should be
applied to certain grants. The proposed definition will alleviate this problem and improve the Department's ability
to effectively administer these grants. Similarly, ambiguities in existing regulations on the use of indirect costs
for matching or cost-sharing and on the reimbursement of indirect costs to groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible parties has contributed to administrative problems between the Department and its grant recipients. The
proposed changes will clarify for all parties how these special situations are to be handled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations in these sections are being revised and reorganized and new sections are being added. Specifically,
the following sections are proposed for revision or addition: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.129_This section is revised to include a reference to a new requirement in &sect;75.564 on the determination
of indirect costs for a grant to a group of eligible parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have
a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain
circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the regulatory

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of certain programs administered by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.561_This section is revised to clarify the approval period for indirect cost rates established by the
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.562_This section is revised and expanded to include a definition of a training grant, a statement that
the Secretary decides which grants are training grants, a clarification of the base to which the training rate is applied,
and a restatement of the existing requirement that indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limitation may not
be charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly or be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. It also explains that a grantee must have documentation
available to show that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.563_This section is revised to refer grantees subject to a restricted indirect cost rate to the new sections
in part 76 on restricted rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed in order to transfer these sections on restricted indirect cost rates
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 76. Since most grants under restricted rate programs are made to agencies of State or local governments, or their
subgrantees, the Secretary is proposing this change to clarify the applicability of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.564_This is a new section that includes several requirements applicable to the reimbursement of indirect
costs, including clarification on the use of indirect costs to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements and
the reimbursement of indirect costs under a grant to a group of eligible parties. The exclusion of certain categories
of grants from reimbursement for indirect costs is proposed, since these types of grants have very little overhead
or administrative costs associated with them. This exclusion is consistent with the current policy of the Department
of Health and Human Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have
a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted
indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.563 is revised to indicate the new sections in part 76 that apply to grantees subject to a restricted indirect
cost rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.564_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.564 and also includes the requirement
that indirect costs not recovered as a result of the restrictions may not be charged directly or charged to other Federal
awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.565_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.565. The term ``general management
costs'' is substituted for ``administrative charges'' to avoid confusion with the latter term as it is used in other
regulations. The section explains that the term general management costs includes some occupancy and space maintenance
costs. It also clarifies what is meant by the terms ``chief executive officer,'' which is used in place of ``chief administrative
officer,'' and ``component'' as these terms are used in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.566_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.566 and clarifies which fringe
benefits may be used in determining fixed costs in a restricted rate calculation.

Section 76.567_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.567 and explains that the term
``other expenditures'' also includes some occupancy and space maintenance costs and costs related to chief executive
officers and their offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.568_This is a new section that defines what is meant by occupancy and space maintenance costs in the computation
of restricted indirect cost rates. The section also describes the limited circumstances in which those costs can
be charged directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

Indirect cost rates for educational training projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Educational training grants provide funding for training or other educational services. Examples of the work
supported by training grants are summer institutes, training programs for selected participants, the introduction
of new or expanded courses, and similar instructional undertakings, including special research training programs,
that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the sponsoring institution. These grants do not usually support
activities involving research, development, and dissemination of new educational materials and methods. Training
grants largely implement previously developed materials and methods and require no significant adaptation of techniques
or instructional services to fit different circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary determines which grants are educational training grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indirect cost reimbursement on a training grant is limited to the amount computed by applying the grantee's negotiated
indirect cost rate or a rate of eight percent, whichever is less, to a modified total direct cost base determined by
the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The eight percent limit also applies to cost-type contracts under grants, if these contracts are for training
as defined in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The eight percent limit does not apply to agencies of State or local governments, including federally recognized
Indian tribal governments, as defined in 34 CFR 80.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limit may not be charged directly, used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing
requirements, or be charged to another Federal award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A grantee using the training rate of eight percent is required to have documentation available for audit that shows
that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Reimbursement of indirect costs is subject to the availability of funds and statutory or administrative restrictions.
The extent to which indirect costs are reimbursed is a matter for determination between the Secretary and the grantee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The application of the rates and the determination of the direct cost base by a grantee must be in accordance with
the indirect cost rate agreement approved by the grantee's cognizant Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indirect cost reimbursement is not allowable under grants for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

on indirect costs must be made in accordance with the restrictions in 34 CFR 76.564&hyph;76.569. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Under programs with matching or cost-sharing requirements, indirect costs that are unallowable as charges to
Federal funds may not be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Indirect costs for a group of eligible parties (see &sect;&sect;75.127&hyph;75.129) are limited to the amount
derived by applying the rate of the applicant, or a restricted rate when applicable, to the grant in keeping with the
terms of the applicant's indirect cost rate agreement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), enacted July 23, 1992, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as certain changes added by Public Law 103&hyph;208, enacted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education.

Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement in the development of proposed regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion and exchange of information concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102&hyph;325. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, attendees at the regional meetings were asked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Kansas City, Missouri. Each participant at the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were discussed by one of the groups at each regional meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific recommendations made at those meetings are addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. The Secretary considered these comments in preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;325 added section 437(c) to the HEA to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that loans will be canceled for student borrowers who are unable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to complete their program of study because the school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific issues described below were discussed in connection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute requires that, to qualify for a cancellation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower must be ``unable to complete his or her program'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the school closed. Participants at the San Francisco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting recommended that the cancellation be available to student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers who are in attendance at the school at the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school closes, or are on a leave of absence or left the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 60 days prior to the school's closure because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deteriorating conditions at the school. The participants at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York meeting agreed that students who are registered at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the school closed should have their loans canceled but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the benefit also be provided to borrowers who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left within 90 days prior to the school's closure. Participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the Kansas City meeting endorsed the 60-day time frame but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that the regulations focus on the date of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announcement that the school is closing if that is earlier than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual date that the school closed. Participants at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atlanta meeting recommended that loan cancellation be provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who are in attendance or on a leave of absence at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Prior Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at all of the meetings agreed that any payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the borrower prior to discharge of the loan should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Teach-Outs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at the meetings discussed whether a loan made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a student who is offered a teach-out of the program in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student was enrolled should be canceled. The participants at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Atlanta meeting concluded that a loan should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged if the student completed a teach-out during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic year for which the loan was made, but that the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be discharged if the borrower did not take or did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a teach-out during that time. Participants at the New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York and Kansas City meetings concluded that a borrower should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the option of whether to accept a teach-out and should have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan discharged if the student does not choose or does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a teach-out program. Attendees at the San Francisco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting stated that they believed that teach-outs do not work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well in practice and that loans should be canceled if a borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not choose to complete the program through a teach-out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Extent of Cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attendees at each of the meetings also discussed whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans should be canceled only for the academic term for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower received the loan or whether all loans received for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program should be canceled. Attendees at the Atlanta meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreed that only the loan made for the period in which the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed should be canceled. Participants at the meetings in New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York and San Francisco (and a substantial minority in Atlanta) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the regulations distinguish between students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in certificate programs and students enrolled in degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The attendees at those meetings believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate students were unlikely to be able to transfer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits earned at the closed school and should have all loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canceled, but that students attending degree-granting schools are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to be able to transfer their credits and should only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive cancellation of the loan for the period in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
e. Process and Documentation Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary be responsible for notifying the guaranty agencies when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a school closes and that the agencies would be responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying the lenders of the loans eligible for cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attendees at that meeting also recommended that collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity be suspended on the affected loans and that public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service announcements be used to notify possibly affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students but that the students not be required to complete any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications or paperwork to prove their entitlement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendees at the Atlanta meeting also recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or a State agency be responsible for determining that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school has closed and that the agencies would notify the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders. The attendees at that meeting also recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower not be required to provide documentation and recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that credit bureau reporting be suspended during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation of possibly affected loans. Attendees at the New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York meeting recommended that the date of a school's closure be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the applicable State licensing authority and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the student not be required to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation of eligibility for cancellation of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Discharge of Loans for Borrowers Whose Eligibility was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Falsely Certified by the School
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 437(c) to the HEA also provided that loans will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canceled for borrowers whose eligibility to borrow was falsely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified by the school. The specific issues described below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were discussed in connection with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Definition of ``False Certification'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's regulations provide that the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations should be considered ``false certification:'' a school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies an application for a borrower who is not eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because he or she does not have the ability to benefit from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training offered; there is fraud by the school in completing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying the loan application or the school cashes checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the borrower's endorsement; or the school submits an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect budget, wrong expected family contribution, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information vital to the determination of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. The participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the definition of ``false certification'' include forged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks, falsification of the student's program eligibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for a particular loan amount, and falsification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower's signature. Participants at the New York meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the Department define ``false certification'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the situation in which the school falsely certifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is an eligible institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Need for Showing of Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations provide that ``false certification'' must relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school's intent to deceive and not include a clerical error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The participants at the New York meeting, who also discussed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue, did not reach a consensus regarding the requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing of intent by the school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only the attendees at the Atlanta meeting discussed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that should be utilized in implementing the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for discharge of loans in cases of false certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations provide that the determination of a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification can be made by the Department, the guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency, or the courts. They also recommended that if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency makes the decision, the regulations should allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school to appeal that decision to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at that meeting also recommended that a lender be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to notify the guaranty agency within 30 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving a complaint that a loan was falsely certified and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection activity be suspended while the agency investigates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim. The agency would be required to complete its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation within 6 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Repayment of Bankruptcy Claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;325 changed the procedure for payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy claims by the Department and requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay the loan if collection of the loan is stayed under Title 11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bankruptcy Code. Participants at all of the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings recommended that the Department define ``stay'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the current definition in the Bankruptcy Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to the Department's question regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate procedure for handling loans that are not ultimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged in bankruptcy, there were differences of opinion. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that if a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not likely to be discharged by the bankruptcy court, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency should obtain the loan from the lender and hold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it until the bankruptcy court action is completed and then return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it to the lender. Attendees at the New York meeting recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lenders be permitted to file bankruptcy claims for payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to the Secretary and if the Secretary wanted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency to service the account, the agency should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to receive at least a portion of any repayment. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that the lender be given the option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repurchase any loan that is not discharged in bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that lenders be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to repurchase any loans not discharged on which a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was paid. Because this amendment has now been superseded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 2(c)(63) of Public Law 103&hyph;208, which incorporated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions found in current FFEL Program regulations, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments are now moot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Garnishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The last statutory provision reflected in these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is section 488A of the HEA, which establishes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national wage garnishment law. That section was added by Public Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
102&hyph;164, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not discussed during the regional meetings or the negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Negotiated Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After completion of the regional meetings, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared draft proposed regulations to implement the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Public Law 102&hyph;325 relating to the FFEL Program. In accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements of section 492(b) of the HEA, those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations were submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the weeks of January 4&hyph;8 and February 1&hyph;5, 1993, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department met with negotiators selected from among individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominated by attendees at the regional meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below of the proposed regulations reflects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations reflect that agreement. The discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below also indicates where consensus was not reached during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations. However, the negotiators did not choose to discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every part of the proposed regulations. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion below of those issues not discussed during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations reflects only the views of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.202&blank;Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 427A of the HEA. The changes in this section include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creation of variable interest rates for new Stafford loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers and the return of excess interest to certain Stafford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an additional 250,000 hours to comply with the requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess interest be returned to certain Stafford loan borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requirement is taken directly from the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.208&blank;Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA. Under the regulations, in cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the holder of the loan remains the same, but there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing change that results in a change in the identity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party to whom the borrower must send payments or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communications, the Secretary would apply the same borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirements that are required by current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 34 CFR 682.208(e) when a loan is sold or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not view this requirement as one that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes any additional burden because lenders and servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already notify borrowers, as a normal business practice, whenever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a servicing change that results in a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity of the party to whom the borrower must send payments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct communications. This requirement is taken directly from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.402&blank;Death, Disability, Closed School, False 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 437 of the HEA. The regulations reflect the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provision for cancellation of a parent's PLUS loan if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student for whom the parent borrowed died. This was not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject of controversy at the regional meetings or during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA with regard to the discharge of a borrower's liability on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL Program loan if the student was unable to complete an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program because of the closure of the school. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing criteria to be used to determine a borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for a closed school loan discharge, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that a student who completed his or her educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed school to another school, or who completed the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a teach-out of the educational program at a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school, should not qualify for a loan cancellation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the closed school discharge was intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit students who could not complete their education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because their school closed, and does not believe that a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who was able to complete the educational program for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan paid should be able to avoid repaying that loan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is particularly interested in receiving public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to the appropriate treatment of a borrower's loan obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the educational program for which the loan was obtained was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multi-year program and the student was able to complete one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more years of that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also believes, contrary to the majority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sentiment expressed at the regional meetings and by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators, that a borrower should submit to the holder a sworn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that demonstrates that the borrower is eligible for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed school discharge to assist the Secretary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designees in pursuing claims against the closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school, and to secure the borrower
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s written commitment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representations on which he or she seeks relief. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that an affidavit or sworn statement is essential in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protecting the interests of the federal taxpayer, and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes that one be obtained from the student as a condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan discharge. By virtue of Federal law (28 U.S.C. 1746), this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affidavit or statement need not be notarized, but the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must state in the document that the borrower makes the statement

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with the sentiment expressed at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional meetings and by the negotiators that conditions at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school immediately preceding its closing may cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterioration in the educational program that would cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student to withdraw. A student who withdraws under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances should be deemed to have been unable to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her educational program because of the school's closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of considering the borrower eligible for loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge, and to balance the interests of the borrower and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed.

False Certification by a School of a Student's Eligibility To

Borrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in the regional meetings and the negotiators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered a wide variety of different actions by the school or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower that they believed should be considered a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of eligibility to borrow; these included virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every express or implied representation in any way related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL Program made by the student to the school, or by the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the lender, guarantor, accrediting agency, state authority, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary. The Secretary has not adopted these views in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations, because the language of the statute itself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and its legislative history shows that the intended scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to discharge loan obligations is considerably narrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than these commenters suggest. The statute authorizes discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the school made a false ``certification of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility,'' a term used only in the FFEL Program regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it refers, only to those representations made by the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the loan application itself regarding the status of the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant (or the student for whom a parent wishes to obtain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PLUS loan) as an eligible student, 34 CFR 682.603; 682.201; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.7, and not to other written representations that relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower's request for a loan, the school's participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL Program, or the quality of the school
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, or placement services. The legislative history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further explains that this provision was intended to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief where the student was ``left without the skills needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain employment'' because of the false certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. H. R. Rep. No. 447, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. 52 (1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the relief proposed by the Secretary here is guided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by these two principles: that the false certification be that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the school on the loan application regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's eligibility, and that the falsity of the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be directly related to the failure to provide necessary skills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some negotiators urged that grounds for cancellation should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include such falsifications as forgery of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signature on the loan application or on the loan disbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check. However, these representations are not part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of the ``certification of the student's eligibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrow.'' Moreover, as a practical matter, a borrower victimized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a forged loan application can be injured only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's endorsement is then forged on the loan disbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check, or the check is negotiated without the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsement at all. In either case, the borrower is generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not liable because such a loan is generally not legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable. Therefore, not only does forgery not constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falsification in the loan ``certification'' process, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower who is the victim of a forgery and did not receive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeds of the loan already has a complete defense to repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the loan, and needs no cancellation relief under this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other negotiation participants suggested that erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school representations on a loan application regarding such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matters as the borrower's (or student's) income, resources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family contribution, or recommended loan amount should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to constitute grounds for cancellation under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. This kind of error could result in the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving a loan in a larger amount than he or she qualifies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive. However, that student may nevertheless receive quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training at the school, and this kind of error or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation does not directly or invariably cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower to be ``left without the skills needed to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment.'' In addition, errors or misstatements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's financial need frequently result in the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving a loan either that only marginally exceeds the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which he or she actually qualified, or that qualified only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reinsurance but not for interest subsidies. Section 437(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directs the discharge of the ``borrower's liability on the loan''_language that does not suggest that a partial discharge
was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplated or intended; discharging the borrower from financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation for the entire loan in such circumstances where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misstatement of financial need affects only part of the loan, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only the borrower's right to interest subsidies on all or part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that loan, is a remedy completely out of proportion to any injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffered by the borrower as a result of the erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of his or her financial need. For these reasons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary concludes that erroneous representations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's financial need are not the kind of false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications for which section 437 was intended to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, participants at the regional meetings and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations recognized that grounds for cancellation of a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation under section 437 of the HEA should include a case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where a student was unable to obtain employment after attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school, and the school had falsely certified that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had the ability to benefit from the school's training. This kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of falsification is both part of the loan certification process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and results in a student being left without needed skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed regulations focus on the school's false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation that the student had the ability to benefit as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds for cancellation under this new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute and regulations have addressed the ability-to-benefit requirement for many years, and the proposed
regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect both the legal elements of that requirement and some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement perspectives developed in implementing it. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the school has always been required to test the ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit only of those applicants who did not have a high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school diploma, and the school therefore does not certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anything regarding the ability to benefit of high school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduates. Since 1987, students who had a general education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diploma, or obtained one after enrolling, and students who lacked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a GED and a high school diploma but completed an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutionally prescribed remedial education program, have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed by Congress to have the ability to benefit, and the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would incorporate that congressional judgement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations therefore would generally permit relief in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of a student whom the school was required to test for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit, but either failed to test at all, or tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in disregard of the requirements for proper use of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. Schools have a continuing legal obligation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer tests, subject to criteria developed by the school's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accreditor, in compliance with test protocols. These criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and protocols may include requirements related both to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of the test results as to the individual tested and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continuing development and validation of the test mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-compliance with testing requirements may warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative sanctions against the school, but a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification claim under this provision requires the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine a different question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A false certification claim depends not on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school met all its obligations with regard to testing, but on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a test already given lacks credibility as a measure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's ability to benefit so that the Department should, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the absence of other evidence, regard the student as lacking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ability. The Secretary expects that practical, specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards will be needed to help identify those deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing requirements that support an inference that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lacked ability to benefit. For example, use of photocopied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versions of tests by the school or test administrator may violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of the test publisher, but may have no direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on the accuracy of the assessment of the student's ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit. Use of an indefensibly low cutoff score by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school on an ability-to-benefit test does not discredit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of the ability of those students who score above a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legitimate cutoff score, such as those now published by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. Similarly, minor deviations from required time limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have little effect on the validity of the test results. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary intends to address these practical considerations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final regulations, and invites public comment on the content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those standards or guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying these standards, moreover, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistently recognized that a student may actually have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit from the school's training even though the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school does not test that student's ability or does so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improperly. The proposed regulations therefore recognize that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who actually obtains employment in the occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the school's program was designed to prepare him or her had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual ability to benefit from that training without regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to whether the school falsified its test of ability to benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A student not properly tested for ability to benefit who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nevertheless completes the program of instruction can reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered to have found the training consistent with his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her aptitude, and the proposed regulations would provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation only if the a student had unsuccessfully tried to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find employment in the occupation for which the program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prepare him or her. Conversely, a student not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly tested who withdraws from the course can be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarded as having found the training not consistent with his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her aptitude, and the proposed regulations grant relief to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of student (or a parent PLUS borrower who borrowed on behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the student) unless the student actually obtained employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the approach that the student's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit should be evaluated realistically, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations would recognize that those individuals admitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of their ability to benefit who met one or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several statutory requirements would nevertheless be regarded as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not having had that ability if they had a physical, mental, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal impediment to employment in, or performance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical duties of, the occupation for which the program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed. Individuals with certain kinds of criminal records or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a history of mental illness may be barred from some positions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the school proposed to train them, and these students could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not benefit from the training even if they successfully completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a test sanctioned by both the industry and school's accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. Other students may lack the physical ability to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a job for which their grades on an industry and accreditor-approved test might otherwise show an ability to perform.
Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kinds of students would qualify (or qualify the parent PLUS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower) for relief under these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of other kinds of falsification were considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential grounds for discharge of the loan under this provision, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including a school's acceptance of a student into an ineligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, but they were not adopted in these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained earlier, the statute uses fairly precise language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe the grounds for discharge under this provision, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language, by authorizing discharge where there has been a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification ``by the eligible institution,'' does not authorize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief where the falsity relates to the eligibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution itself. Thus, although misrepresentations regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school's financial or administrative capability, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school's placement services or the quality of the school's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, faculty, or equipment, may well have induced the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to enroll at the school, those representations are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the process of ``certification'' of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility to borrow, tend to constitute claims that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution was in fact not an ``eligible institution,'' and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not the kind of representations for which this statute authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief. These proposed regulations therefore do not treat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falsifications by the institution about itself as grounds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the vocational schools that are the primary focus of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this statutory provision, representations about the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution include representations about the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its programs, and, under the statute and regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is virtually defined in terms of the programs it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers. 20 U.S.C. 1088 (1992); 34 CFR 600.7, 668.7(a)(2)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, because the statute confines relief precisely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of false certifications regarding the eligibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student, not on representations that would tend to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution itself was not eligible, the Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that the statute authorizes relief where the alleged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation goes to the eligibility of the program in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student was enrolled. For these reasons, relief under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would not permit a borrower to secure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation by challenging the eligibility of the program or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school itself, but would require a demonstration by the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the school failed to test (or tested improperly) his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit and that he or she did not secure employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the occupation for which the school stated its program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prepare the student.

Section 437(a) of the HEA as amended by the Higher Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992 allowed a lender to submit and receive payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a bankruptcy claim on the date on which the borrower filed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief in bankruptcy, an action that ``stays collection'' of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan, rather than when the loan was discharged, as under prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law. The proposed regulations submitted to the negotiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process would have revised current regulations as needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement this change. Other features of current bankruptcy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim processing were to remain unchanged. Section 2(c)(63) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208 reinstated standards for payment of bankruptcy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims consistent with those now found in FFEL Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5); pursuant to section 5 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208, this most recent change took effect as if

enacted as part of the 1992 amendments. Any regulations needed

to implement this change, moreover, are not subject to negotiated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcies. Nothing in the amendments suggested that such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result was intended, and the proposed regulations would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submission of a bankruptcy claim only in the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would continue to require lenders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to file proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency directs otherwise or the holder is officially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified by the court that no assets are available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. If the guaranty agency later receives notice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets have become available, the guarantor must file a proof of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim at that point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the negotiated rulemaking proceedings noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a growing number of discharges were being received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers who file sequential bankruptcy petitions, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those who first file for relief in Chapter 13. During the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pendency of the prior bankruptcy case, loans in repayment less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than seven years are non-dischargeable without proof of undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardship, yet cannot be enforced by the holder according to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original terms; little or nothing may be paid on those loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the proceeding. Rather than attempting to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment would constitute an undue hardship, or negotiating an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-sensitive repayment arrangement with the holder, borrowers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who complete their Chapter 13 proceeding may then file a second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy petition, making sure that the second is filed more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than seven years after the loan entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bankruptcy Code excludes the period of ``any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension of the repayment period'' from the seven-year period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during which loans are dischargeable only for undue hardship. 11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A). If the term ``suspension of the repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period'' is read, as these borrowers contend, to include only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forbearance or deferments granted by the holder of the loan, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reality of the forbearance imposed by virtue of the automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stay in the prior bankruptcy_which barred enforcement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan according to its terms during the pendency of the bankruptcy_would be ignored, and borrowers who have neither
made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required seven-year attempt to repay nor demonstrated undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardship would obtain a discharge in the second bankruptcy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not consider this interpretation of the statute to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be consistent with its purpose, and the only court that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed this precise issue has concluded that the period during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which enforcement of a loan is stayed in a prior bankruptcy is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``applicable suspension of the repayment period'' for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing the seven-year period for a subsequent bankruptcy.

In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re Saburah,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 136 B.R. 246, 254 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above discussion, the Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpret the term ``applicable suspension of the repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period'' to include periods during which the automatic stay in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy proceeding is in effect. The Secretary further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that a borrower who in fact meets his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation under the original repayment agreement during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy has acted in a manner consistent with the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute, and this proposed interpretation would not regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of the first bankruptcy as a period of suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment for the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The death and bankruptcy requirements in proposed &sect;682.402 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are taken directly from the HEA. There is no change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current disability cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Closed School Cancellations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closed school cancellation provision is taken, in large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, directly from the mandates of the HEA, although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations reflect some areas of necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation. The discussion that follows is grouped into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three major areas where the Secretary and the negotiators had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to interpret the statutory closed school cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Student Withdrawal Prior to the Closing of the School
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was unanimous agreement among the negotiators and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that it would be inequitable to strictly limit a closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school cancellation to only those students who were in attendance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the school on the date that the school officially closed. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed earlier, conditions at the school immediately preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its closing may have caused a deterioration in the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program that would have prompted a student to withdraw. Such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student should not lose entitlement to a loan cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of his or her prescience or inability to tolerate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school's deterioration. To balance the interests of students and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Student Use of Teach-out or Transfer of Academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed earlier, the Secretary does not believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who completed the educational program for which the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was intended, even though the completion occurred through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teach-out at another school or by the student's transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic credits earned at the closed school, should be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid repaying that loan. The student is not required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer those credits or make use of a teach-out opportunity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but if the student chooses to do so, then the Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, because the student was able to complete the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, it would be unfair to require the Federal taxpayer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the student's loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Student Statement Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that a statement made by the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under penalty of perjury demonstrating eligibility for a closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school discharge should be obtained from the student to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary or the Secretary's designees in pursuing claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the closed school. Without this statement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's ability to protect the interests of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer would be frustrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.410&blank;Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative wage garnishment requirements are taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide an alternative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed collection requirements in &sect;682.410(b) if a guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency uses collection agencies and administrative wage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnishment. Through these regulations, the Secretary expects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize default collections by the Department of Education, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations implement the national wage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnishment provision in section 488A of the HEA, under which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies or the Secretary may garnish up to 10 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the wages of a borrower who has defaulted on an FFEL Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan or who is not making required payments under a repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. Under the proposed regulations, at least 30 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before garnishment proceedings are initiated the borrower must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given written notice informing him or her of the nature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the loan obligation to be collected, the intention of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guaranty agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights regarding the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide the borrower with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the debt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a new repayment agreement, and receive a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment schedule. In addition, no withholding of a debtor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wages may occur in the case of an individual who has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involuntarily separated from employment until that individual has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would replace current regulatory provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that authorize wage garnishment by guaranty agencies in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488A of the HEA protects borrowers by prohibiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers from taking disciplinary action against an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the fact that the individual's wages are subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnishment. The statute permits a borrower to sue an employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who takes such an action, and authorizes the court to award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attorneys' fees, punitive damages, back pay, reinstatement, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other remedies the court believes reasonably necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary particularly requests comments on whether there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other state laws that might frustrate the purpose of section 488A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should be preempted. The Secretary asks commenters to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide specific information on those laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the

HEA by requiring lenders to warn borrowers and endorsers about

the possibility that their wages may be garnished by the guaranty

There are minimal burdens, if any, that will be associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with including a warning about possible wage garnishment in the

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Burdens specifically associated with information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient administration of the program.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are imposed on guaranty agencies, lenders, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools by the regulations. These requirements, however, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant impact because they would not impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 682.208, 682.402, and 682.410 contain information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations affect the following types of entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that participate in the FFEL Program: Guaranty agencies, lenders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and schools. The Department needs and uses this information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly carry out its responsibility to administer certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual public reporting burden for this collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is not expected to significantly increase. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and reporting of the information in &sect;&sect;682.208 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
682.410 reflect normal business practice, whereas the closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school cancellation provision of &sect;682.402 essentially substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a closed school claim for a default claim that normally would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have occurred if the student did not repay a loan made for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance at a school that closed.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and cancellation of loans due to
death, total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, and false certification by a school of
a borrower's eligibility for a loan, are set forth in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, or a Consolidation loan was obtained by a married couple,
and only one of the borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection of his or her loan obligation
stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated
to repay the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A loan qualifies for payment under this section only to the extent that the loan is legally enforceable under applicable
law by the holder of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative
tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment
that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant
to an objection presented in a proceeding prior to credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment,
or other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and
no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the
payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines
in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Death.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of
death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not
available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be canceled only if the guaranty agency determines that other
evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the
information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that
the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the
lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite
diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender
shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance
as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died,
the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after
the date of the borrower's (or student's) death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Total and permanent disability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the lender determines that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. A borrower is not considered totally
and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the
borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently
disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the
time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated,
so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation
loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans.

(or student) was enrolled, closed, or the borrower (or student) withdrew from the school not more than 90 days prior
to the date the school closed.

(A) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever it becomes aware of reliable information indicating a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating school may have closed. The designated agency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state in which the school is located shall promptly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate whether the school has closed, and whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teach-out of the closed school's program was made available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, and report the results of its investigation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary no later than 30 days after receiving the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If a guaranty agency determines (or is informed by the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 30 days of making that determination or being informed by

records of loans that it holds and identify all borrowers (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students) who appear to have been enrolled at the closed school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the closing date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the date the school closed. If the guaranty agency knows the

borrower under paragraph (d) of this section, mail a discharge

application and an explanation of the information that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to the

borrower. The application shall inform the borrower of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for a discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing of that determination and the reasons for it within 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after receiving the borrower's completed application and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sworn statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender, guaranty agency, or the Secretary.

believes to be reliable from another source indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower may be eligible for a loan cancellation under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of this section, the lender shall immediately suspend any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the

 (i) Unless it initiates procedures to garnish the borrower's wages in accordance with paragraph (b)(10) of this section,
a guaranty agency shall attempt annual IRS offset on all eligible loans and engage in at least the collection activities
described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (xii) of this section on a loan on which it pays a default claim filed by
a lender, except that the agency may engage in the collection activities described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section
in lieu of the activities described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (vi) of this section. If, after initiating
wage garnishment procedures, the agency terminates those procedures for a particular borrower, the agency shall,
within 30 days, commence collection efforts at least as forceful as those described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through
(xii) of this section. The agency's collection efforts shall begin with the same collection activities as those that
immediately preceded the initiation of garnishment procedures, or, if no collection activities had been performed,
the agency shall begin with the activities described in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the agency
may engage in the collection activities described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section in lieu of the activities described
in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (vi) of this section.

(B) Send at least three written notices to the borrower forcefully demanding that the borrower immediately commence
repayment of the loan, and informing the borrower that the default has been reported to all national credit bureaus
(if that is the case) and that the borrower's credit rating may thereby have been damaged. The final notice also must
indicate that it is the final notice the borrower will receive before the agency will take more forceful action, including
the initiation of procedures to garnish the borrower's wages or instituting a civil suit to compel repayment of the
amount that the borrower owes plus related collection costs.

the borrower's wages or institute a civil suit against the borrower for repayment of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii)(C) of this section, in the case of a loan that was assigned to the Secretary
prior to the 545th day and returned to the agency less than 180 days prior to the 545th day, the agency has 180 days from
the date it receives the returned loan to garnish the borrower's wages or institute a civil suit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii)(D) of this section, in the case of a loan not assigned to the Secretary,

day unless that loan is subsequently assigned to the Secretary by the deadline for the next available opportunity
to collect by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax refund offset, or a payment is received from the borrower fewer than

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative Garnishment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If a guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decides to garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making payments on a loan held by the agency, on which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim, it shall do so in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The employer shall deduct and pay to the agency from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's wages an amount that does not exceed 10 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's disposable pay for each pay period, or the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless the borrower provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose, the term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's compensation from an employer remaining after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last known address, a written notice of the nature and amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the debt, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the borrower's rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency under terms agreeable to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(10)(i)(J) of this section concerning the existence or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the debt and, in the case of a borrower whose repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule is established other than by a written agreement under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(10)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer (including a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower who is self-employed) for any amount that the employer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal pay and disbursement cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for at least 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the agency to proceed with garnishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(10)(i)(H) of this section must contain only the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-person or by telephone conference. All telephonic charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be the responsibility of the guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(K) If the borrower's written request is received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency on or before the 15th day following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's receipt of the notice described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested hearing. The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be rendered within 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(L) If the borrower's written request is received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency after the 15th day following the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, the guaranty agency shall provide a hearing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(M) A hearing may not be conducted by an individual under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that an agency may appoint an administrative law judge to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(N) The hearing official shall issue a final written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) References to ``the borrower'' in this paragraph include
