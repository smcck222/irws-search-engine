 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing regional meetings to discuss options for addressing certain
concerns expressed by a number of States in comments submitted to the NRC on the proposed rule on the environmental
review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. The concerns that will be addressed involve
provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States
to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need, reliability, cost, resource options, and other
non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The minutes will be transcribed by a court recorder in all regional
meetings.

 The purpose of the regional meetings is to gain the views of the States and other interested parties on how the NRC should
treat need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources in its final rule on the environmental review for
renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. The NRC published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish new requirements
for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants (September 17,
1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement
(GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in part 51. The public comment period on the proposed
rule, the GEIS, and other related documents closed on March 17, 1992. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft
GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating capacity, and alternative
energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict
with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need,
reliability, cost, resource options, and other non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission
instructed the NRC staff to develop options for responding to these State concerns. In developing the options the
staff is to solicit the views of the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff is soliciting the views of the States through four regional meetings and a request for written comments.
To facilitate discussions with the States the staff has prepared a paper, ``Addressing the Concerns of States and
Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit
Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper,'' which
may be either examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037, or obtained
from Donald P. Cleary at the address provided above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each meeting will be conducted in a panel format with panelists representing those States that submitted comments
on the treatment of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources, other interested States, electric
utilities, the NRC, and interest groups concerned with the economic regulation of electric utilities. All interested
persons are invited to attend as observers and time will be scheduled to take questions and comments from the floor.
The meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter. Written comments on the matters covered in the staff paper
and the meetings are invited. The public comment period will close on March 4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each meeting will begin at 10 a.m. and, with a 1 hour lunch break, will continue until 5 p.m. if participation warrants.
Registration will be conducted one-half hour prior to the meeting.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its tamper-resistant packaging requirements to require
that all over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products marketed in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules be sealed. This
proposal follows continuing tampering incidents involving two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. The agency is also
proposing a change in terminology throughout its regulatory program from ``tamper-resistant`` to ``tamper-evident.``
In addition, FDA is soliciting comments on whether additional regulatory changes, such as packaging performance
standards, may be necessary. These proposed amendments are part of the agency's continuing review of the potential
public health threat posed by product tampering and are meant to address specific vulnerabilities in the OTC drug
market and to improve consumer protection.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend its tamper-resistant packaging regulation for OTC drug products in &sect;211.132 (21 CFR
211.132). The regulation requires that all OTC drug products (except dermatologics, dentifrices, insulin, and
throat lozenges) be in packaging designed to provide consumers with visible evidence of any tampering that has occurred.
FDA first adopted these requirements in 1982 to respond to the public health emergency in which seven persons in the
Chicago area died after taking cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules (47 FR 50442, November 5, 1982). Investigations
showed that the cyanide had been intentionally introduced into the capsules after they had reached the retail shelf.
Although the product's packaging met all FDA requirements at the time, it was not designed so that tampering would
leave visible evidence. The poisoning fatalities illustrated the risk that consumers of OTC drugs faced without
such protective packaging. FDA met with industry experts to explore ways to reduce this risk and to develop specific
recommendations for OTC drug packaging designs that would make malicious tampering more obvious. These recommendations
formed the basis of the agency's initial regulatory approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1982 regulation required that most OTC drug products be packaged in a tamper-resistant package, which was defined
in &sect;211.132(b) as packaging having an indicator or a barrier to entry that could reasonably be expected to provide
visible evidence to consumers that tampering had occurred. In addition to meeting this general standard, &sect;211.132(b)
required that the tamper-resistant feature be distinctive by design or use a barrier to entry that employed an identifying
characteristic such as a logo. The regulation further required that OTC product labeling alert consumers to the specific
packaging feature being employed (&sect;211.132(c)). All requirements of this regulation were in effect by February
6, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA continued to monitor the effectiveness of its regulatory program and found that, while the program had resulted
in significant improvements in protecting consumers from tampering harm, OTC products marketed in two-piece, hard
gelatin capsules remained vulnerable to malicious tampering. In fact, all known fatalities from contaminated OTC
drugs, including three deaths in 1986_4 years after the tamper-resistant packaging requirements were first imposed_were
associated with this dosage form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing the persistent vulnerability of the hard capsule, the agency amended its tamper-resistant packaging
regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 2, 1989 (54 FR 5227), to require that OTC products marketed in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules be packaged
using at least two tamper-resistant features, unless the capsules were sealed using a tamper-resistant technology
(&sect;211.132(b)(1) and (b)(2)). FDA concluded that an additional packaging feature would reduce the dangers
posed by OTC drug tampering by making it more likely that the consumer would see signs of tampering when it occurred.
This requirement went into effect on February 2, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even with this extra level of regulatory protection, two-piece, hard gelatin capsules remain vulnerable to malicious
tampering and have been implicated in the latest fatalities. In February 1991, two persons in the State of Washington
died and another became gravely ill after ingesting counterfeit Sudafed capsules contaminated with cyanide. The
capsules had been packaged using a number of tamper-resistant packaging features that met FDA requirements. The
tampering was crudely done and left obvious signs: while both the counterfeit product and the Sudafed product were
in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules, the counterfeit capsules were larger than the legitimate Sudafed capsules,
lacked the company logo and ``Sudafed`` imprint, and lacked the blue gelatin band found on Sudafed capsules. In addition,
the foil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
backing on the package's blister card had been cut, and lot numbers on the blister card did not match those on the carton.
The contaminated capsules also contained a yellowish powder, rather than the white granules contained in Sudafed
capsules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sudafed package and dosage form met FDA's tamper-resistant standard, providing visible signs of tampering that
were both numerous and conspicuous. The fact that physical harm from the tampering nonetheless occurred was of concern,
and illustrated the need for a renewed focus on consumer education and involvement in the effectiveness of tamper-resistant
or tamper-evident packaging. In response to this most recent incident, the agency convened a task force to review
existing regulatory strategies and to consider what further steps could be taken. The task force also considered
information provided by outside experts, including packaging scientists and representatives of drug manufacturing
trade associations. A number of options were discussed, including banning the use of two-piece, hard gelatin capsules
for OTC drug products or restricting their availability by requiring that they be kept behind the pharmacy counter.
These discussions balanced the value of the hard capsule dosage form to consumers against its continued vulnerability
to malicious tampering. Memoranda from these discussions are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) and are available for inspection between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During these discussions, FDA gave serious consideration to banning the use of two-piece, hard gelatin capsules,
but has tentatively concluded that such capsules should remain available for several reasons. First, FDA believes
that banning hard gelatin capsules because they have been associated with tampering may give consumers a false sense
of security that tampering with other dosage forms could no longer occur. Second, FDA believes that a ban would deprive
the public of a useful dosage form. The Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 indicated that the two-piece, hard gelatin capsule can have certain features not provided by other dosage forms that
are currently available. For example, many consumers prefer to take capsules, finding them easiest to swallow. In
addition, some medications can only be formulated in the capsule dosage form, due to detrimental effects on active
ingredients from tableting or other formulation processes. Hard gelatin capsules also may contain fewer inactive
ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, than some tablet and oral liquid formulations.
Moreover, the hard gelatin capsule dosage form is sometimes necessary to deliver timed-release medications. Given
the potential benefits of capsules, FDA believes that, at this time, it is appropriate to seek to decrease the risks
posed by product tampering through means other than banning two-piece, hard gelatin capsules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is based on investigations and discussions surrounding the 1991 tampering fatalities, as well
as FDA's ongoing review of the public health threat from OTC drug product tampering. The proposal suggests some specific
regulatory measures for reducing the potential for tampering with the vulnerable hard capsule dosage form. It also
presents additional ideas for improving the effectiveness of current policies directed against product tampering
and invites public discussion and comment on these ideas. By proposing the regulatory changes and encouraging a dialogue
on the subject of improving anti-tampering measures and involvement of the consumer, the agency hopes to increase
protection of the public against malicious tampering.

A. Description of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend its tamper-resistant packaging regulation to decrease the potential for harm from tampering
involving two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. FDA also proposes to take certain steps to focus the attention of all
parties on the need to make consumers aware of the special packaging features that indicate that tampering has occurred.
The proposed changes complement a number of other actions that FDA is taking both to improve consumer awareness and
to encourage the development of better packaging technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One proposed change would amend the current regulation that establishes specific requirements for OTC products
marketed in two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. As noted, this dosage form has been subject to the most serious tampering
incidents over the years. The regulation now requires that these products be packaged using a minimum of two tamper-resistant
packaging features, unless the capsules are sealed by a tamper-resistant technology, in which case, one packaging
feature is sufficient (&sect;211.132(b)(1) and (b)(2)). Proposed revisions to &sect;211.132(b)(2) would require
that any OTC drug product marketed in a two-piece, hard gelatin capsule be sealed using a technology that would provide
evidence that the capsule has been tampered with after filling. (Some capsule sealing technologies are described
in FDA's Compliance Policy Guide 7132a.17.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
) The proposed rule would no longer require that such products be packaged in a container with two tamper-resistant
packaging features. The proposed rule would require that the sealed capsules be in packaging employing a minimum
of one tamper-resistant feature, the requirement that applies to all other affected OTC dosage forms. The agency
believes that requiring OTC capsules to be sealed may decrease the likelihood that successful product tampering
will occur with this dosage form. This proposed change would not apply to one-piece, soft gelatin capsules, also known
as soft gels. FDA specifically requests comments on whether the proposed requirement to seal all two-piece, hard
gelatin capsules would adversely affect any patient population or specific drug entity or drug class.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is also proposing that the term used to describe the packaging requirements be changed from ``tamper-resistant''
to ``tamper-evident.'' FDA believes that the term ``tamper-evident'' more accurately describes the role of packaging
in reducing the likelihood of harm from tampering, and emphasizes the necessity of consumer involvement in the effectiveness
of any packaging system designed to meet the requirements of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in terminology is intended to underscore the view that no package design is tamper-proof. The packaging
of the Sudafed capsules did not prevent the 1991 tampering incidents, although it met FDA requirements and the evidence
of tampering was strikingly visible. The proposed adoption of ``tamper-evident'' terminology should remind all
parties that the success of these regulatory initiatives depends significantly on consumer vigilance. The proposed
rule would also revise &sect;211.132(c) to clarify the requirements for the tamper-evident packaging labeling
statement. By alerting consumers to the particular tamper-evident packaging features used, the labeling statement
plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of any tamper-evident packaging system. Consumers who are alerted and aware
of all packaging features used are in the best position to detect the evidence of tampering that the package has been
designed to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Current &sect;211.132(c) states that each retail package ``* * * is required to bear a statement that is prominently
placed so that consumers are alerted to the specific tamper-resistant feature of the package.'' Some firms have interpreted
this as requiring the labeling statement to refer only to tamper-evident features on the external package. Proposed
&sect;211.132(c) would clarify that, in order to alert consumers to the tamper-evident packaging features used,
the labeling statement must identify all packaging features used to comply with proposed &sect;211.132(b)(1),
including those on the secondary package, those on the immediate container or closure, and any capsule sealing technologies
that are employed to meet the requirements of proposed &sect;211.132(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also revise &sect;211.132(b) and (c) to remove reference to OTC products in aerosol containers,
which are inherently resistant to tampering, but not appropriately considered in a discussion of tamper-evident
packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also amend &sect;211.132(a) and (b) to replace the term ``throat lozenge'' with ``lozenge.''
FDA is making this change because the tamper-evident packaging requirements should apply to all lozenges, not just
throat lozenges. The agency also notes that the proposed change is consistent with earlier tamper-resistant packaging
regulations (see 48 FR 16658 at 16664, April 19, 1983).

B. Legal Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is authorized in part by sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) concerning imposition
of requirements necessary to assure that drugs meet the requirements of the act for identity, strength, quality,
and purity. These requirements may be imposed as current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) and in aid of other statutory requirements relating to product safety and integrity.
(See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 351(b) and (c) and section 701 (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) of the act.) This statutory authorization permits
promulgation of requirements for container and package design that provide protection against intentional product
adulteration by means of tampering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Promulgating requirements for labeling statements alerting drug product consumers to tamper-evident features
is authorized under the adulteration provisions in section 501 and under the provisions in sections 502 and 201(n)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(c) and 321(n)). The labeling statements are necessary to assure the effectiveness of the
tamper-evident features; without such statements the products would be adulterated. In addition, under section
502(c) of the act, products are misbranded if statements required under other authority in the act are omitted from
the products' labeling. Moreover, under sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act, products may be misbranded by reason
of the omission of material facts about the products, such as the tamper-evident features. (See 47 FR 50442 at 50447,
November 5, 1982, for additional discussion of the legal authority for requirements related to drug product tampering.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Consumer Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1991 tampering fatalities made clear that the OTC drug supply is still vulnerable to malicious tampering. As noted,
FDA's deliberations following these fatalities focused on reevaluating current strategies to reduce the likelihood
of harm from tampering and looking at the role that FDA, industry, and consumers play in their success or failure. While
the agency will consider whether additional changes to the regulations may be needed to reduce the risks posed by product
tampering, FDA believes that further initiatives will increasingly focus on consumer education and involvement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA has already taken steps to inform consumers about the need to be alert for drug product tampering. FDA has worked
closely with NDMA to develop and disseminate public service announcements about tampering. These are being provided
to general circulation magazines and other publications. In addition, the October 1991 issue of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA Consumer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contained an article entitled ``Look Twice,'' which explains the danger posed by drug product tampering and the need
for consumer vigilance. Similar information appears in materials cosponsored by FDA and NDMA including a brochure
called ``Buying Medicine?: Stop, Look, Look Again'' and a video and audio tape on product tampering entitled ``Take
A Look,'' which has been distributed to the media. FDA is also considering sponsoring workshops around the country
to inform the public about tamper-evident packaging and the safety of the OTC drug supply. FDA solicits comments and
suggestions from the public on ways to improve this educational campaign.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Research Into Consumer Behavior
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory strategies FDA has adopted have been based on certain assumptions about how consumers behave when
buying and taking their OTC drug products. To choose the most effective measures to enable consumers to detect tampering,
it is necessary to have more and better information about how consumers select, purchase, and use OTC drug products
and how tamper-evident packaging and associated labeling affects their behavior. FDA is aware of some research in
this area, including studies done at Michigan State University, Rutgers University, and other academic institutions.
Although such research has provided useful starting points for discussions of tamper-evident packaging, FDA believes
that further research is needed to permit the design of more effective packaging features and educational campaigns.
FDA is interested in learning more about any current consumer research that is relevant to the concerns of this rulemaking.
FDA is also willing to assist any industry group or other interested party in the design and development of research
in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Private Initiatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the agency has taken several steps to encourage the use of safer packaging technologies. FDA believes that
these steps can be complemented by actions of drug manufacturers and other interested persons. The agency initiatives
in 1982 were taken with the knowledge that certain packaging technologies, including, for example, film wrappers,
blister or strip packs, and heat shrink bands or wrappers, were available to drug manufacturers to reduce the risk
of tampering. The agency notes that few new technologies have been added since 1982. The agency recognizes that no
package is tamper-proof but believes that there are opportunities for innovations and for refinement of current
designs to improve consumer protection. FDA encourages both individual and collective efforts in the OTC drug and
packaging industry to devise better technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA would also like to discuss with the drug industry and other interested persons the possibility of establishing
performance standards for tamper-evident packaging. Such standards might be based on the probability that a consumer
could detect evidence of tampering with a given packaging design. Compliance with the standards might be measured
by studying the likelihood that a consumer would recognize signs of tampering within a specified amount of time. Where
a packaging feature is to be used on a product targeted to or frequently purchased by a particular group of consumers,
such as the elderly, the level of recognition might be determined using a representative number of the particular
group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Developing performance standards based, in part, on the behavior and reaction of consumers to product packaging
would be challenging. FDA believes, however, that it is not an impossible task, and suggests that information from
the research and development of package design from a marketing standpoint might be useful. Furthermore, the agency
believes that any performance standards for tamper-evident packaging should be based on the latest behavioral and
technological information available. Such state-of-the-art standards would give packaging engineers and manufacturers
a benchmark for evaluating particular package designs, and would provide an incentive to improve the effectiveness
of tamper-evident packaging to mirror technological progress in the field. The agency invites comments on the appropriateness
of developing and requiring performance standards for tamper-evident packaging.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has carefully considered the economic impact of this proposed rule and has determined that it requires neither
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified by Executive Order 12291, nor a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The agency believes that the proposed rule, if finalized,
would generate costs that are well below the thresholds that would signify a major rule, and so the proposed rule does
not require a regulatory impact analysis. The agency also finds that the proposed rule would not have a significant
effect on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current FDA requirements for OTC drug packaging to protect the public from the threat of product tampering have been
in place since 1982. This proposed rule would not change the scope or applicability of these requirements, but would
only amend the requirements with regard to one OTC drug dosage form and impose a minor labeling change that would affect
certain products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule may impose additional costs on manufacturers who choose to market their OTC drug products in two-piece,
hard gelatin capsules instead of switching to a different dosage form, such as a soft-gel or liquid-gel capsule, or
a caplet. The proposed rule would delete the current requirement that two-piece, hard gelatin capsules be packaged
using two tamper-evident features, and would require instead that all such capsules be sealed and packaged using
at least one tamper-evident feature. FDA believes that capsule sealing would make it more difficult to tamper with
this dosage form without leaving visible evidence, and that any costs resulting from the rule would be small compared
to public health benefits from this added measure of consumer protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of two-piece, hard gelatin capsule OTC products sold over the last few years has declined dramatically,
with fewer than 50 such items currently listed with FDA. A review of those products indicates that from 75 percent to
90 percent are already sealed or ``banded.'' Thus, FDA is aware of only a small number of OTC products still marketed
as unsealed two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. Under the proposed rule, the few firms producing these products would
have to choose between incurring costs for reformulating the product to a different dosage form or installing machinery
needed to seal the two-piece, hard gelatin capsules. The affected firms would not face substantial added costs for
lost product inventory because the proposed rule allows manufacturers 1 year and retailers 2 years after the date
of publication of a final rule to effect the changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NDMA estimates that the approximate cost of a capsule sealing or banding machine ranges from $150,000 to $250,000.
Assuming FDA's higher bound estimate that only 25 percent of the 50 listed, two-piece, hard gelatin capsule products
are not currently sealed with an appropriate technology, then 12 products would need to be sealed or banded. If only
one new capsule banding machine were needed per product, the total cost to the industry would range from $1.8 million
to $3 million. An additional cost may occur if it is difficult for a company to integrate the sealing equipment into
its capsule filling line. According to NDMA, some companies may find that this problem adds an extra cost of approximately
50 cents to 80 cents per 1,000 capsules. Nonetheless, for all but the smallest product lines, these costs would be a
modest percentage of sales. The proposed rule would also change regulatory terminology from ``tamper-resistant''
packaging to ``tamper-evident'' packaging. This would affect a substantial number of firms because it would necessitate
a labeling change under &sect;211.132(c) for all OTC products that now have the words ``tamper-resistant'' on their
package. A small survey conducted by FDA found that approximately 60 percent of OTC drug product labels include the
words ``tamper-resistant.'' The remaining product labels include a description of tamper-resistant packaging
features, but do not specifically use the words ``tamper-resistant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In 1986, NDMA estimated that about 70 percent of their members' 435 products, excluding private labelers, were affected
by tamper-resistant packaging regulations. On the assumption that there were three shelf keeping units (SKU's)
per product, this amounted to about 1,300 SKU's. Based on a 1986 survey of its members, NDMA had reported that the average
labeling change cost per SKU was $3,000 to $4,000. The current proposal, however, would require a much simpler label
change than was considered in that 1986 survey. Nonetheless, if the cost per SKU were assumed to be about $3,000, the
total cost of changing 60 percent of these labels would be approximately $2.3 million (60 percent x 1,300 x $3,000).
In addition, NDMA provided a preliminary estimate of $5 million for 15 larger private labeling companies. Sixty percent
of this cost amounts to $3 million. Thus, the potential upper-bound cost imposed by the proposed labeling changes
may amount to $5 to $6 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual cost of the labeling change would be significantly lessened by FDA's proposed effective date for the labeling
change, which would give manufacturers up to 2 years from the date of publication of a final rule to make the required
changes. The agency chose this timeframe to minimize the burden to industry of converting to ``tamper-evident''
terminology, based on information from NDMA that most product labels are routinely reprinted within an 18- to 24-month
period. Thus, although FDA does not know the precise number of OTC product labels that are normally reprinted within
a 2-year period, the labeling costs attributable to the proposed regulation would be minimal for most firms in this
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To summarize, the total one-time costs of this proposed rule would be the sum of the approximately $3 million to seal
or band the remaining few two-piece, hard gelatin capsule products and the minimal costs needed to change the labeling
on the products that currently read ``tamper-resistant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition to these regulatory changes, FDA has invited comments on other initiatives such as the development of
better consumer education campaigns, research into consumer behavior with regard to OTC packaging and tamper-evident
packaging, and the possibility of developing performance standards for tamper-evident packaging. Any of these
programs, if adopted as regulatory requirements, could have significant economic importance. Before promulgating
any final regulation, however, FDA intends to consider all relevant information on the economic consequences of
these initiatives and reasonable alternatives. The agency solicits public comment on all aspects of both the costs
and feasibility of all issues raised by this proposal, especially with respect to any impact on affected small businesses.

IV. Executive Order 12612_Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that Federal agencies carefully examine regulatory actions to determine if they
would have significant federalism implications. FDA's tamper-resistant packaging regulations were issued with
the intent that the regulations preempt State and local packaging requirements that are not identical to the Federal
requirements in all respects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 50442 at 50447, November 5, 1992). The agency believes that the proposed changes would improve safeguards to
protect consumers from tampering of all OTC drug products, particularly those marketed as two-piece, hard gelatin
capsules, and that the amendments, therefore, should eliminate the need for additional action at the State or local
level. FDA invites comments on the adequacy of the proposed amendments in this regard.

VII. Proposed Effective Dates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes that any final rule based on the proposed requirement that all OTC drug products marketed as two-piece,
hard gelatin capsules be sealed be made effective 1 year after its date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All OTC drug products marketed as two-piece, hard gelatin capsules that are initially introduced or initially delivered
for introduction into interstate commerce on or after the effective date must be sealed according to the requirements
of the final rule or be subject to regulatory action. FDA also proposes a retail level effective date for this requirement
of 2 years after the date of publication of a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After this date, all two-piece, hard gelatin capsule products held for sale (including stocks in retail stores)
must be sealed according to the requirements of the final rule or be subject to regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also proposes that any labeling changes necessary to reflect the adoption of ``tamper-evident'' terminology
be made within 2 years after the date of publication of a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on information from industry, FDA expects that most products subject to tamper-evident packaging requirements
will have undergone routine labeling revisions within this timeframe.

Requirements for tamper-evident package
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin,
or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this product is accessible
to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry
which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering
has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will
discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one
or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered
trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term ``distinctive by design'' means the packaging
cannot be duplicated with commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container
and closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to provide a visual
indication of package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled
in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail display. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any two-piece,
hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed using an acceptable tamper-evident technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) In order to alert consumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug
product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules or containers of compressed
medical oxygen) is required to bear a statement that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identifies all tamper-evident feature(s) and any capsule sealing technologies used to comply with paragraph
(b) of this section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is prominently placed on the package; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section uses an identifying
characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For example, the labeling
statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say ``For your protection, this bottle has an imprinted seal around the
neck.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) *&blank; *&blank; * A request for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under
&sect;10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a ``Request for Exemption from the
Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.''&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 14, 1993 [58 FR 65295]. In Notice No. 785, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) proposed to
amend its regulations to liberalize the requirements for using a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label.
The current regulations provide that a wine may bear a multistate appellation of origin only where the wine is in conformance
with the laws and regulations governing the composition, method of manufacture, and designation of wines in all the
States listed in the appellation. The proposed amendment would provide an exception where State laws and regulations
do not authorize the use of a multistate appellation of origin which includes that State for wines sold within its boundaries.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 14, 1993, ATF published Notice No. 785, soliciting comments from the public and industry on a proposal
to amend 27 CFR 4.25a(d)(3) to make it more practical to use a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label. This
proposal was based on a petition by Stimson Lane Ltd., a company with wineries located in Washington and California.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has received written requests from the Wine Institute and the American Vintners Association (AVA) for additional
time to review and analyze the issues raised in this rulemaking proceeding. Since the Wine Institute and AVA are directly
impacted by issues raised in Notice No. 785, ATF believes that reopening the comment period is justified. Therefore,
the comment period is being reopened until March 21, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule will amend 28 CFR part 68, which contains the rules of practice and procedure for administrative
hearings conducted to enforce sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''). Sections
274A and 274B were added to the INA by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (``IRCA''), and were amended by
title V of the Immigration Act of 1990 (``IMMACT''), which added section 274C to the INA. These amendments are necessary
to bring the practices and provisions established in part 68 into conformity with the provisions of the INA. Specifically,
these amendments will clarify the amount of time a party has to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals an Administrative
Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the INA require that hearings be held before Administrative Law Judges in cases involving
allegations that a person or other entity has:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Hired, or recruited or referred for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing that the alien is
unauthorized to work in the United States; or has so hired or referred or recruited for a fee, any individual when the
hiring person or entity fails to comply with the employment eligibility verification requirements (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Continued to employ an alien in the United States knowing that the alien is or has become unauthorized with respect
to such employment (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(2));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Imposed, in the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment of any individual, any requirement that the individual
post a bond or security, pay or agree to pay any amount, or otherwise guarantee or indemnify against any potential liability
under 8 U.S.C. 1324a for unlawful hiring, recruiting or referring of such individual (8 U.S.C. 1324a(g)(1));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Engaged in unfair immigration-related employment practices (8 U.S.C. 1324b); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Knowingly participated in activities involving fraudulent creation or use of documents for the purposes of satisfying,
or complying with, a requirement of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 24, 1987, the Department of Justice published an interim final rule establishing administrative practices
and procedures to implement sections 274A and 274B of the INA. 52 FR 44972. After receiving comments, the Department
published the final rule on November 24, 1989. 54 FR 48593. That rule governed all cases properly brought before an
Administrative Law Judge that complied with the requirements of the INA. Then, on November 28, 1990, Congress enacted
the Immigration Act of 1990, which amended sections 274A and 274B of the INA, and added section 274C. These amendments
necessitated certain revisions to the practices and procedures established by part 68, which were set forth in an
interim rule with request for comments, published October 3, 1991. 56 FR 50049. After receiving comments, the Department
published the final rule on December 7, 1992. 57 FR 57669. The final rule, however, did not distinguish between the
time the Administrative Law Judge ``enters'' an order and the time an order is ``issued''. This distinction is critical
in clarifying the amount of time a party has to appeal an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section
274C proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals. Based upon experience gained by the Office of the Chief Administrative
Hearing Officer in implementing the hearing procedures and the statutory language regarding the Chief Administrative
Hearing Officer's review authority found at section 274A(e)(7), it is proposed that &sect;68.2 paragraph (i) be
revised to reflect the reference made to the definition of ``entry'' in the revised definition of ``issued'' at &sect;68.2(k),
and that &sect;68.2 paragraph (k) be amended to account for the thirty (30) days the Chief Administrative Hearing
Officer has to modify or vacate an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or 274C proceeding after the Administrative
Law Judge enters the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of
section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does it have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment
in accordance with section 6 of E.O. 12612. The Attorney General has certified to the Office of Management and Budget
that these final regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778.

 The Regional Centers Program is authorized by sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA, which is part of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Appropriations for the Regional Centers Program were authorized through September
30, 1993 by the DFSCA. Section 414 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) authorizes an automatic extension
of the DFSCA through FY 1994 (September 30, 1994). The Congress is considering reauthorization of the DFSCA, but final
action on the reauthorization is not expected until late in FY 1994.

. Since FY 1990, these centers have been maintained through continuation awards in three subsequent fiscal years
(FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993). Each center has received approximately $3 million per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the automatic extension authorized under section 414 of GEPA, projects authorized under sections 5111(a)(1)
and 5135 of the DFSCA can be funded in FY 1994 as well. Any funding after FY 1994 would be dependent on future Congressional
action with no guarantee that projects funded under the current authorization could be supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a new competition under the existing legislation were held in FY 1994, the projects could only be funded for a limited
project period of 12 months. In the past, it has taken new centers up to a year to ``start up,'' given the scope and complexity
of the services they provide and the time it takes to hire qualified staff and develop plans and relationships that
are responsive to clients in their regions. The Assistant Secretary believes that starting new centers in FY 1994
for only 12 months would severely disrupt the quality and level of center services. Holding a competition in FY 1994
would impose considerable costs at the Federal level without a guarantee that the new centers would be able to provide
the technical assistance necessary to school districts as the Department moves to implement Goals 2000 and the new
ESEA.

Therefore, the Assistant Secretary proposes, in the best interests of the Federal Government, to extend the current
projects for one additional year with the Federal Government bearing the cost. This proposal is consistent with the
President's mandate to implement cost-effective, cost-saving initiatives. In order to make these cost extensions,
the Assistant Secretary must waive the regulation at 34 CFR 75.261, which permits extensions of projects only at no
cost to the Federal Government. In consideration of the foregoing, the Assistant Secretary proposes to waive 34 CFR
75.261 as applied to the DFSCA Regional Centers Program during FY 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is proposing new regulations under 17 U.S.C. 802(d), supplementing
and superseding the former Copyright Royalty Tribunal's rules and regulations which were adopted on December 22,
1993. 58 FR 67690 (1993). The Office is also proposing a course of action for dealing with rate adjustment and distribution
matters which were pending before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination. A meeting open to the public will be held
on February 1, 1994 at 10 a.m. to discuss all issues related to today's publication.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (``Reform Act'').
Public Law No. 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304. Effective immediately upon enactment, the Reform Act amends the Copyright
Act, 17 U.S.C., by eliminating the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and transferring its responsibilities and duties
to ad hoc Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs), to be administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright
Office. As directed by the new act, the Librarian of Congress will convene Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels for
the purpose of adjusting rates and distributing royalties. See 17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 116, 118, 119 and chapter 10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Immediately upon enactment of the Reform Act the Copyright Office issued a notice adopting the full text of the former
Tribunal's rules and regulations on an interim basis. 58 FR 67690 (1993). This action was required by new section 802(d)
of the Copyright Code, which provides:

Effective on the date of the enactment of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, the Librarian of Congress
shall adopt the rules and regulations set forth in chapter 3 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations to govern
proceedings under this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall remain in effect unless and until the Librarian,
upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, adopts supplemental or superseding regulations under subchapter
II of chapter 5 of title 5.

17 U.S.C. 802(d). The Copyright Office made only slight technical changes to the former Tribunal's rules, stating
that it intended to review and revise the rules during the course of a future rulemaking. 58 FR at 67690 (1993). The Office
now commences that proceeding to conform the rules to the new system of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels.

II. Matters Pending Before the Former Tribunal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major issue facing the Copyright Office of Library of Congress at the outset of today's proposed rulemaking is the
resolution of rate adjustments and distributions, and related matters, which were pending before the Copyright
Royalty Tribunal at the time of its demise. Some of these proceedings, such as distribution of 1990 cable royalties,
had already commenced hearings, while others were awaiting determination of controversies or rulings on procedural
issues. Since the Office is proposing new rules and regulations which will govern and shape rate adjustment and distribution
proceedings under the new system, the Office must first decide how to handle the Tribunal's old business.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office is of the firm opinion that it is not the successor agency or office to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.
The Reform Act represents a radically different approach for adjusting rates and distributing royalties for the
copyright compulsory licenses, and is not an absorption of one agency by another. The Tribunal is replaced, not moved
or merged, by ad hoc Arbitration Panels which are to be administered by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress.
The Office is therefore not simply picking up where the Tribunal left off, but is responsible for administering a completely
new system of ratemaking and distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Copyright Office is not a successor agency, it is our preliminary finding that all proceedings pending
before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination were terminated at that time. In other words, the Office will not
continue to conduct and handle matters and proceedings which were before the Tribunal, but will require that all parties
which had pending business before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination must, if they desire the matter to receive
further consideration, file the matter anew before the Copyright Office. Thus, for example, the Librarian will not
automatically convene a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel to pick up where the proceedings left off for the 1990
cable distribution, but will require the parties who participated in that proceeding to refile their case with the
Office in accordance with the rules and regulations proposed below. While the Office understands that the parties
may be somewhat burdened by duplicating at least a portion of their case, it is necessary that the Office wipe the slate
clean and, for purposes of the operation of the proposed rules and administrative efficiency, begin anew the matters
pending before the former Tribunal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An issue related to the termination of proceedings pending before the former Tribunal and the requirement of new filings
is the legal effect of orders and decisions issued by the Tribunal during those proceedings. New section 802(c) of
the Copyright Act states that Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels ``shall act on the basis of *&blank;*&blank;*
prior decisions of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal *&blank;*&blank;*'', but does not bind the Panels to those decisions;
the effect of those decisions on the Librarian or the Copyright Office is not mentioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office has no intention of questioning or reopening matters decided by the former Tribunal with respect
to ongoing proceedings. However, we understand that the termination of pending Tribunal proceedings and the requirement
of new filings will likely raise again some of the issues previously decided by the Tribunal. The Copyright Office
of the Library of Congress makes a preliminary finding that, while we will look to the Tribunal's decisions and orders
for guidance, neither the Office nor the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels are legally bound by those decisions.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 All legal issues related to proceedings pending before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination may therefore be
resubmitted to the Copyright Office and, where appropriate, to the Arbitration Panels for consideration.

The Copyright Office acknowledges that it is of course bound by rate adjustments and distributions that the Tribunal
had conducted and concluded before its elimination. Thus, for example, the Office will not entertain any petitions
to reexamine cable distributions for years earlier than 1990.

III. Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revising the former Tribunal's rules is a particularly complicated task, given the division of authority between
the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels and the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. Under the old law the
Tribunal acted as a single autonomous body; in contrast, the distribution of royalty fees or the setting of royalty
rates under the new legislation will often be a multistage process. For example, in order to adjust a compulsory license
royalty rate, the Librarian of Congress, with the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, must appoint an arbitration
panel and then review the panel's report and, with the Register's recommendation, either approve the report or substitute
his/her own judgment. This new system renders many of the former Tribunal's rules and regulations inappropriate,
and requires creation of a new framework to allocate responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the Library and the Copyright Office recognize the desirability of preserving as much continuity
as possible between the old and new systems.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rules are based upon and seek to track the structure and organization of the former Tribunal's rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for continuity is underscored by the Reform Act's instruction that the Tribunal's rules be fully adopted
upon enactment, to be later amended or superseded. See 17 U.S.C. 802(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Library and Copyright Office have thoroughly reviewed the entire body of the former Tribunal's rules and regulations
and considered the extent to which they fit with the new bifurcated system of ad hoc Arbitration Panels administered
by the Library and the Office. The results are today's proposed rules, which are intended to preserve the essential
elements of the Tribunal's system while taking into account the requirements and complexities presented by an independent
arbitration process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the outset a technical change is required by the regulations governing the Code of Federal Regulations itself;
the former Tribunal's rules are being moved from Chapter III to Chapter II of Title 37, CFR. Chapter III is repealed,
and Chapter II is restructured to accommodate the new body of regulations. Chapter II, which until now has contained
five individual parts (Parts 201&hyph;204 and 211), will be divided into two subchapters. Subchapter A will contain
the five original parts of Chapter II, and new Subchapter B will contain the entire body of the former Tribunal rules,
along with today's proposed changes. And future rule changes or additions bearing upon the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels will appear in subchapter 8 of Chapter II, 37 CFR.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The part numbers of the rules generally track the Tribunal's original structure (parts 301&hyph;311), and are redesignated
parts 251&hyph;259 of the Copyright Office's rules. Two parts of the Tribunal's former rules, parts 303 and 305 relating
to jukebox performances, are being repealed since their relevance has been eliminated by the Reform Act's repeal
of the jukebox compulsory license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main task of today's proposed rulemaking is to provide the substantive changes in the former Tribunal's rules
necessary to implement the Reform Act and to create a workable and efficient system for adjusting royalty rates and
distributing royalties. The following is a part-by-part summary of the proposed changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 251 is a proposed revision of part 301 of the former Tribunal's rules, which covered most of the Tribunal's operating
procedures and rules of practice. This is the part that is in greatest need of revision, since many of the rules are inappropriate
to govern the new system of ad hoc Arbitration Panels. The following summarizes the proposed changes in the various
subparts of part 251.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A of part 251, entitled ``Organization'' and describing the composition of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal,
was rendered superfluous by the Reform Act. Since it is necessary to create a completely different organizational
scheme to implement the new system, we are planning to repeal all of subpart A and to substitute completely new provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Official Address.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Part 251.1 provides a single official address for all proceedings and actions conducted under subchapter B. Establishment
of an official address is important, since many sections of subchapter B refer to this section or require documents
to be filed at this address, including all royalty claims, requests for information, public access to documents,
payments of Arbitration Panel costs, and motions, objections, and records filed with the Panels. Moreover, since
all records submitted to the Copyright Office, to the Library, and to the CARPs are, with limited exceptions, available
to the public for inspection and copying, a single address is required to assure that all documents will be assembled
in a single location for the convenience of those wishing to inspect them. We also believe that providing a single permanent
repository for all documents created and submitted under subchapter B is not only important, but required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All this may seem self-evident, but there is a problem here. Unlike the proceedings of the Tribunal, arbitration proceedings
will not necessarily take place at a single location, within the Library of Congress or elsewhere. There may be incentive
in particular cases for parties to deliver filings directly to the actual location where the CARP is meeting, but we
believe it would be a mistake to allow entire filings to go to locations different from the mailing address specified
in these proposed regulations. Any possible advantages of such a system to the parties or the Panels would be outweighed
by the dangers of confusion among parties to different proceedings and possible uncertainties and difficulties
in mail receipt and delivery. Since individuals' rights often depend on the timely filing and delivery of papers,
the guarantee of proper handling can only be afforded by delivery to a single address in the Copyright Office of the
Library of Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, while section 251.1 creates a single official address, section 251.44 provides the parties flexibility
in submitting documents and filing papers. In cases where an Arbitration Panel is conducting a hearing, the arbitrators
are directed to establish requirements permitting delivery of filings directly to them, as long as one copy of the
filing is delivered to the Copyright Office at its official address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of the CARPs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.2 describes the purpose of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels: to make rate adjustments and/or
royalty distributions for the cable (17 U.S.C. 111), mechanical (17 U.S.C. 115), jukebox (17 U.S.C. 116), public
broadcasting (17 U.S.C. 118), satellite carrier (17 U.S.C. 119) and digital audio recording devices and media (17
U.S.C. chapter 10) licenses. The jurisdiction of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels is more limited than that
of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal which, for example, had authority to adjust the royalty maximum for digital audio
recording devices. This adjustment is now the province of the Librarian. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 U.S.C. 1004(a)(3). There are also certain arbitration procedures in the Copyright Act which are not within the
jurisdiction of the CARPs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
List of Arbitrators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Reform Act provides that the selection of arbitrators for a Royalty Panel must be made from ``lists provided by
professional arbitration associations.'' 17 U.S.C. 802(b). Sections 251.3 and 251.4 govern the creation and use
of those lists. Before the beginning of each year (and, in the case of the current year of 1994, before March 1), any professional
arbitration association or organization may submit a list of its member arbitrators who would be qualified to serve
on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Specific information is required with respect to each person whose name
is submitted, including current and past employment, educational background, and a description of the facts and
information that would qualify the person to serve as an arbitrator. After receiving the lists, there will be an initial
screening process in which the Librarian will determine: 1) if the proposed person meets the necessary qualifications
to serve as an arbitrator; and 2) if that person can reasonably be expected to be available during that calendar year.
The names of persons meeting the requirements will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the beginning of each year (in the case of 1994, by March 1), and this publication will serve as the master list from
which the Librarian can select names for any arbitration proceeding commencing in that calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objection Procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Librarian will screen the master list, and there is also a procedure for objection. The objection procedure is
confined to the period before an individual arbitration proceeding begins, and is limited to the parties participating
in that proceeding. In the case of rate adjustment proceedings, parties may file their objections during the 90-day
``cooling off'' period following the filing of petitions for adjustment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;251.63. In the case of distribution proceedings, objections must be filed during the precontroversy discovery
period specified by &sect;251.45(a). Objections must clearly spell out the facts and reasons for disqualification
of persons on the arbitrator list, and the Librarian will consider them during the selection process for the first
two arbitrators. Once the Librarian has made his selections, the objections will be made available to the two arbitrators
to assist them in their selection of the third arbitrator. No peremptory objections will be allowed.

Qualifications of the Arbitrators. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.5 describes the qualifications a person must have to serve as an arbitrator. We have deliberately avoided
adopting an extensive and specific list of qualifications on the theory that the results of a long, overly-particularized
list of qualifications would likely result in a homogeneous Panel, and that the Librarian should be able to choose
from persons of diverse backgrounds and skills. The Reform Act requires that an arbitrator have experience in conducting
arbitration proceedings, and experience in settling disputes. The only two qualifications the Office has added
are membership in a bar association and ten or more years of legal practice. Since the arbitration process contemplated
by the Reform Act often resembles an adjudicatory procedure more than a traditional arbitration, the Office felt
that it was necessary for arbitrators to be lawyers with a fair amount of experience as practitioners. The area of practice
is not specified; we believe that a background in copyright, though helpful, is not necessarily indispensable to
serving as an arbitrator. Keeping the number of qualifications to a minimum should produce a diversified group of
individuals to serve as arbitrators with the necessary legal training and experience to accomplish the task efficiently
and effectively.

Selection Process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.6 describes the selection process for an arbitration panel, restating the process described in the Reform
Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17 U.S.C. 802(b). The section requires the chairperson to act according to the majority wishes of the panel. There
is also a provision regarding substitution of arbitrators who, after selection, for some reason become unable to
continue service. In that event, the Librarian is directed to select a replacement promptly unless hearings have
already begun in the proceeding. If hearings have begun, the remaining arbitrators or arbitrator would constitute
the quorum necessary to render a determination.

Division of Authority between Librarian and CARP. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.7 underscores the division of authority between the Librarian and the Royalty Panels. The Panels are
limited by the statute to making determinations in individual and separate proceedings necessary to settling a controversy
over royalty rates or distributions. Although given authority to issue orders governing the conduct of the proceedings,
the Panels do not have rulemaking authority to amend or otherwise alter these rules and regulations when they are issued
in final form.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, since the Panels are not independent agencies, they have no authority to publish materials in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because the Panels are considered a part of the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress, any orders and rulings
of the Panels that are to be published must be issued under the auspices of the Office and the Library.

Section 251.42 allows an individual Panel to waive or suspend the rules of subchapter B for purposes of the proceeding.
In the cases where Subchapter B does not prescribe a rule governing a particular question, the Panel, in accordance
with 17 U.S.C. 802(c), may adopt its own rule for purposes of that proceeding. This provision is designed to give a Panel
some flexibility in executing its duties with respect to the facts of its case. It is not, however, a grant of rulemaking
authority, and any waiver, suspension or adoption of a rule has effect only on the course of that proceeding and in no
way affects the rules and regulations of this subchapter or their application to other proceedings. It is expected
that each Panel will follow these rules and apply them in a way that produces a just and equitable proceeding.

2. Subpart B_Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law No. 94&hyph;409, 90 Stat. 1241, does not apply to Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panels, since CARPs are not an ``agency or agencies,'' the Copyright Office believes that the
provisions of the Act should apply to the conduct of meetings held by the arbitrators. This Subpart, therefore, tracks
the procedures governing open and closed meetings which the former Tribunal adopted and followed with only a few changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 251.11 states that all meetings of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel shall be open to the public unless
otherwise specified. Notice of the anticipated schedule of the hearings will be placed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least 7 days before the meeting. As amendments to the schedule are made, every practicable effort will be made to
keep the public informed. Section 251.12 provides for public and media access to open meetings, adopting the former
Tribunal's rules 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

in toto.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sections 251.13 to 152.16 prescribe the procedures to be followed in closed meetings, adopting virtually all of the
former Tribunal's rules. Section 251.13 drops the requirement of closed meetings for internal personnel matters,
since the Panels are without authority to hire or maintain personnel, but it adds to the discretion of the Panel to go
into closed session to deliberate on a motion or objection raised orally at hearing. Section 251.16 directs that transcripts
of closed meetings shall be kept at the Copyright Office, which is the official address for all arbitration proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Subpart 3_Public Access to and Inspection of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As in subpart B, the copyright Office is proposing in subpart C to adopt the former Tribunal's rules with respect to
public access to and inspection of records, but with some important changes. The range of documents available to the
public is expanded. Section 251.21 provides that, with limited exceptions, all records of the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels, and also those of the Librarian of Congress assembled and/or created under 17 U.S.C. 801 and 802, are
available for public inspection and copying. Thus, for example, rulings or decisions of the Librarian made before
the convening of an Arbitration Panel would be publicly available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same difficulties raised by adoption of a single official address, as discussed above, also arise with respect
to the location of documents. While all filings with a CARP required by the proposed rules must be submitted through
the Copyright Office, certain documents other than filings may, during the course of a proceeding, be in the sole possession
of a Panel. Example are a document admitted into evidence during the course of a hearing to impeach the testimony of
a witness, or the transcript of an ongoing proceeding. Section 251.22 therefore specifies that all documents and
records in the sole possession of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel and not required to be filed with the Copyright
Office may be maintained by the chairperson at the location of the hearing, or at a location specified by the Panel.
All requests for access, however, must be directed to the Copyright Office, and not the Arbitration Panel. In the case
of documents solely in the possession of the Panel, the Copyright Office shall made arrangements to allow the person
making the request to inspect and copy them. The schedule of fees for services of this sort are those currently charged
by the Copyright Office for like services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Copyright Office already has its own Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act guidelines, see 37 CFR
parts 203 and 204, it is not adopting the former Tribunal regulations related to those Acts. The Office acknowledges
that some adjustments to those rules may be required by the peculiarities of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
system, but we believe there should be some practical experience before we identify any necessary changes.

4. Subpart D_Standards of Conduct
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Office is not proposing any regulations at this time, but as part of this proceeding we are inquiring as to standards
of conduct that should apply to the arbitrators.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
The Copyright Office is proposing to repeal subpart D, as it appeared in the former Tribunal's rules, and replace it
with rules governing standards of conduct for arbitrators. Former subpart D contained Equal Employment Opportunity
provisions for the Tribunal, which are no longer relevant for CARPs since they are without authority to hire personnel
or maintain a staff.

5. Subpart E_Procedures of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As with so many of the rules of this subchapter, the new bifurcated system of the Reform Act requires some changes in
the former Tribunal's rules governing the conduct of proceedings. Nevertheless, although consequential adjustments
are needed, we believe that the over-all system of procedures long used by the Tribunal in rate adjustment and distribution
proceedings have served the public interest well and should be preserved. Maintaining the Tribunal's system to the
extent possible should reduce the learning process for parties that have appeared before the former Tribunal for
many years and should also, we hope, avoid some confusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of CARPs Procedures and Practice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the most part the hearing procedures and motions practice applicable to the CARPs are carried over from those of
the former Tribunal. Section 251.40 specifies that the procedural rules of this subpart E apply only to the Copyright
Arbitration Royalty Panels and not to the actions of the Librarian or the Copyright Office, unless otherwise expressly
provided in this subpart. The section also states that subpart E only applies to CARPs, and not to other arbitration
proceedings under the Copyright Code. The Office is not statutorily required to apply these rules to other arbitration
proceedings. Although it is possible that some or all of these rules may ultimately be adopted for other arbitration
purposes; the statement clarifies the issue as of now and grants the Office flexibility in making future decisions
on the point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Formal Hearings and Other CARP Proceedings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.41 direct the Panels to conduct formal hearings for rate adjustment and royalty distribution proceedings.
All parties intending to participate in a hearing must file a notice of their intention to do so. The Panels are also
allowed to conduct other proceedings in the exercise of their basic functions, subject to section 251.7. For example,
in the course of a distribution controversy, a legal issue may arise which requires resolution before the proper distribution
can be determined. The Panel could conduct a proceeding to resolve that issue, which would be part of its function in
determining the distribution. It may also happen that resolution of the legal question will permit the parties to
the proceeding to settle their differences, thereby avoiding the need for a Panel distribution determination. The
Panel, however, is still subject to section 251.7, and could not conduct a rulemaking proceeding affecting any provisions
of subpart E. Section 251.41 also recognizes that, in the interest of reducing the expense of litigation, some parties
may wish to have their royalty entitlement or rate determined solely by written submissions, and a procedure for petitioning
the Librarian to have a ``paper'' proceeding is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Suspension or Waiver of Rules; Ad Hoc Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, although it is clear that the Arbitration Panels have no rulemaking authority, section 251.42 authorizes
them to waive or suspend the rules of subpart E for purposes of a particular proceeding. This carries on a practice formerly
used by the Tribunal, and allows the Panels flexibility in addressing the specific conditions and circumstances
of each proceeding; if the Panels were not allowed this flexibility, the resulting procedural rigidity could produce
injustices. In cases where subpart E is silent as to the correct procedure to be observed, the Panel may follow its own
procedures, as long as they are consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. However, as with suspension or
waiver, the ad hoc procedures adopted by that Panel apply only to that particular proceeding and that particular Panel.

Institution of Proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was the case with the former Tribunal, proceedings before a Panel begin with the filing of the written direct case.
Section 251.43 specifies that the written direct case must include all testimony and exhibits, complete with proper
referencing. Each party submitting a written direct case must specify its requested royalty rate or percentage of
the royalty pool, whichever is applicable. No evidence may be submitted in the direct written case without a sponsoring
witness or official notice, unless good cause is shown. Section 251.43 also gives Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panels discretion in setting the time for the filing of written rebuttal cases after the conclusion of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing and Service of Written Cases and Pleadings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.44 governs the filing and service of written cases and pleadings. The division of authority, together
with the possible differences in the location of the Copyright Office and the places where the CARPs hold their hearings,
require special filing and service requirements. The former Tribunal could maintain all records and evidence at
one location, but this is not possible under the new system. Section 251.44(a), therefore, requires that an original
and three copies of all filings made to a Panel be submitted in such manner as the Panel shall direct. As was discussed
above in connection with the official mailing address, location of arbitration proceedings is likely to change,
and the circumstances surrounding mail delivery and receipt could be uncertain. Section 251.44(a) allows the Panels
flexibility to deal with this problem by allowing them to establish the means of delivery, whether it be by direct hand
delivery, delivery to a specified address, or establishment of a temporary post office box. The parties submitting
filings, however, are still required to deliver one copy of their pleading or filing to the Copyright Office at its
official address. In the case of large or bulky filings, a Panel may reduce the number of copies it requires, but a complete
copy must nonetheless be submitted to the Copyright Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 251.44(b) prescribes the requirements with respect to all filings with the Librarian of Congress_that is
motions and pleadings filed with the Librarian in accordance with these proposed rules both before and after the CARP
proceedings. Under the proposed rule, each party must file an original and five copies with the Copyright Office.
Section 251.44 also maintains the English-language translation, affidavit, subscription and verification, and
service requirements of the former Tribunal.

Precontroversy Discovery. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.45 significantly expands the scope of permitted discovery in arbitration proceedings. In his statement
accompanying H.R. 2840. Representative William Hughes, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property
and Judicial Administration of the House Committee on the Judiciary, commented favorably on the use of precontroversy
discovery and exchange of information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. Nov. 22, 1993) (``In order to reduce the amount of actual litigation time, and thereby
reduce expenses, I encourage the Librarian to promulgate regulations permitting exchange of information before
the tolling of the 180-day decision period, and, to the extent practicable, generally to permit precontroversy discovery.'').
Section 251.45 is proposed to explore the efficacy of Chairman Hughes' recommendation. We particularly seek comments
on the scope of such precontroversy discovery: whether it should include interrogatories of witnesses as well as
production of supporting documents, and whether it would advance Chairman Hughes' goal of reducing costs by being
able to stipulate facts and remove issues, or whether the additional procedures might add costs to the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of royalty distribution proceedings, the proposed rule directs the Librarian to designate a period for
precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents. This period is to start after the filing of claims and to end at
the declaration of a controversy, and is the same time period referred to by section 251.4(b) for the filing of objections
to arbitrators. In the case of rate adjustment proceedings, the period for precontroversy discovery and exchange
of documents corresponds with the 90-day consideration period for all rate adjustment petitions and proceedings
specified by &sect;251.63.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All parties to a proceeding may voluntarily exchange documents during this time, or may make discovery requests.
Failure to respond to requests, and any other discovery controversies or issues, will be resolved by the Librarian.
All other objections to royalty claims or petitions, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings, shall also
be submitted to the Librarian for decision during the same time period. All parties to the proceeding will be given
14 days in which to respond to a motion or objection, regardless of whether or not this 14-day period goes beyond the
time periods specified in subsection (a). The Librarian, after consultation with the Register, shall rule on all
motions or objections timely submitted, and will not declare a controversy and initiate arbitration proceedings
until all rulings have been made. See 17 U.S.C. 801(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discovery and Motions during Proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.45(c) prescribes a similar procedure for exchanging documents and motions and objections filed with
a Panel once a proceeding beings. The Panel must designate a period for discovery with respect to both the written direct
and rebuttal cases. No time limits are set on the length of the discovery periods_although, given the Panel's 180-day
existence, the deadline will necessarily be short.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the filing of written cases, either direct or rebuttal, any party may file objections. If an objection is apparent
on the face of the written case, it must be raised or may thereafter be considered waived. Section 251.45(d) allows
each party whose claim, petition, written case or direct evidence is the subject of an objection, either before the
Librarian or a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, to amend its filing to respond to the objection. The Librarian
or the Panel may also request that such amended filing be made where necessary. All parties will be given a reasonable
period of time to conduct discovery on the amended filing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 251.46 through 251.48 are adopted nearly intact from the former Tribunal's rules. Section 251.46 describes
the role of the arbitrators and the chairperson during the course of a hearing. Section 251.47 describes the course
of proceedings once a hearing has begun, and section 251.48 prescribes the rules of evidence. Only conforming changes
have been made to these sections.

Transcript and Record. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.49 governs transcription of the hearings and creation of the record. The Librarian shall, from time to
time, designate an official reporter to transcribe the hearings of any arbitration proceedings taking place during
that time. Since arbitration proceedings are likely to take place in different locations, the location of the transcript
will not always be at a fixed site. Therefore, the chairperson is directed to specify the location of the transcript
for public inspection. It is anticipated that the location will usually correspond to that of the hearing, although
this may not always be the case. Once the arbitration proceeding is concluded, the transcript, along with the full
written record, will be delivered to the Librarian and may be viewed at the Copyright Office.

Section 251.50 gives CARPs the authority to issue rules and orders necessary to the resolution of the proceedings.
Once again, the absence of the Panels' authority to issue rulemakings amending, superseding, or supplementing the
rules and regulations of this Subchapter is underscored.

Section 251.51, with respect to closing the hearing, and section 251.52, on submission of proposed findings and conclusions,
are adopted intact from the former Tribunal's rules, with conforming amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 251.53 essentially codifies the provisions of 17 U.S.C. 802(e) governing the report of Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels to the Librarian of Congress. The determination of a Panel is to be certified and signed by all the arbitrators,
and any written dissent is to be certified and signed by the dissenting arbitrator. Panels must distribute copies
of their determination to all participating parties.

After the conclusion of an arbitration proceeding, the Panel will assess its costs in accordance with the above-described
proportions. The chairperson will deliver a statement to each participating party listing the Panel's total costs,
the party's individual share, and the amount due to each arbitrator from that party. Payment is to be made to each arbitrator,
as provided in the statement, and must be made either by money order, check, or bank draft. Failure to submit timely
payment will subject the party to the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.

Post-Panel Motions; Order of the Librarian; Effective Date; Appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the arbitration process has concluded and the Panel has delivered its report, the Reform Act requires that the
Librarian of Congress review the sufficiency of the Panel's determination within 60 days of receipt of the report.
Section 251.55 grants the parties to the proceeding 14 days in which to file petitions with the Librarian requesting
that the determination be modified or set aside, and an additional 14 days to reply to such petitions. The petitioner
must clearly state its reasons for the modification or reversal, and include applicable portions of its proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law. After the four-week period has run, the Librarian will proceed to a decision
on the Panel's report. Section 251.56 essentially codifies the review process described in 17 U.S.C. 802(f), with
the Librarian publishing the order of his/her decision in the Federal Register and delivering it to all the parties
to the proceeding. The order is to be effective 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register, unless an appeal
is taken (&sect;251.57). The appeals process described in &sect;251.58 comes directly from 17 U.S.C. 802(g).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic procedural mechanics of an arbitration proceeding are described in Subpart E, but the different nature
of rate adjustment proceedings in comparison with that of distribution proceedings calls for additional separate
requirements. Subpart F contains those requirements for rate adjustment proceedings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope of Subpart F. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.60 describes the scope of Subpart F, emphasizing that it applies only to rate adjustment proceedings
and that it augments the rules of Subpart E. In circumstances where one or more provisions of Subpart E and F are inconsistent,
section 251.60 makes clear that Subpart F is controlling.

Commencement of Proceedings; Content of Petitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.61 describes the commencement of adjustment proceedings for the applicable compulsory licenses. Adjustment
is either automatic, as in the case of non-commercial broadcasting, or by petition, as in the cases of cable, phonorecords,
jukeboxes, and audio home recording devices and media. The section implements the changes made by the Reform Act with
respect to the dates when proceedings begin or when petitions may be filed. Thus, cable rate adjustment petitions
may be filed in 1995 and every 5 years thereafter; those for phonorecords in 1997 and every 10 years thereafter; those
for jukeboxes within one year of termination or expiration of a negotiated license; and those for audio home recording
devices and media from October 29, 1997 to October 28, 1998 and not more than once a year thereafter. In the case of noncommercial
educational broadcasting, the Librarian will publish notice of initiation of arbitration proceedings on June 30,
1997, and every 5 years thereafter. Section 251.62 adopts the former Tribunal's rules governing the content of a petition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Period for Consideration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.63 is an important provision. Although it adopts the 90-day ``cooling off'' period used by the Tribunal
to facilitate settlements after the filing of a petition, or prior to a non-commercial educational broadcasting
rate adjustment, the 90-day period is significant for other purposes. This same 90-day period is used to conduct precontroversy
discovery and exchange of documents (&sect;251.45), and to file objections to names on the arbitrator list (&sect;251.4).
The Librarian will designate the 90-day period for consideration by publishing notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the expiration of the 90-day period, and after the Librarian has resolved all motions submitted during that
period, section 251.64 prescribes that the Librarian will determine the sufficiency of the rate adjustment petition.
If the petition is sufficient, the Librarian will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a declaration of a controversy and, at the same time, a notice of initiation of an arbitration proceeding. The same
declaration and notice of initiation shall be done for noncommercial educational broadcasting in accordance with
17 U.S.C. 118(b) and (c). The declaration and notice of initiation will commence the 180-day period for proceedings
described in 17 U.S.C. 802.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final section of Subpart F, &sect;251.65, implements section 802(h)(1) of the Copyright Act which allows the
Copyright Office and the Library to assess their reasonable costs for the rate adjustment proceeding directly to
the participating parties. These costs include any administrative services provided under U.S.C. 801(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart G is like Subpart F in that it prescribes additional procedural requirements inherent in certain royalty
distribution proceedings. There are three compulsory licenses that require royalty-fee distributions: cable,
satellite and digital audio. Section 251.70 states that the provisions of Subpart G apply to these licenses, and underscores
that, in the case of inconsistencies, Subpart G takes precedence over Subpart E.

Section 251.71 describes the commencement of distribution proceedings by prescribing the time period for the filing
of royalty claims.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of cable, claims must be filed during the month of July; for satellite during July; and for digital audio
during January and February. Under section 251.72, after the filing of claims as prescribed by 17 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;111(d)(4)(B)
(cable). 119(b)(4)(B) (satellite carrier), and 1007(b) (digital audio), the Librarian must determine whether
a controversy exists. The Librarian may issue requests for information or conduct hearings to assist in determining
the existence of a controversy, with notice of the proceedings to be published in the

Section &sect;251.74 is the royalty-distribution counterpart of &sect;251.65; it allows the Library and the Copyright
Office to deduct their reasonable costs incurred as a result of a distribution proceeding. These expenses include
administrative services provided under 17 U.S.C. 801(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 252 prescribes the filing requirements for claims to cable royalties. The Part significantly revises the former
Tribunal's rules governing the filing of cable claims by implementing a procedural system similar to that adopted
by the Tribunal for the filing of digital audio claims. See 58 FR 53822 (1993). Section 252.1 defines the scope of Part
252. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time of Filing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 252.2 specifies the time of filing for cable claims. Claims for cable royalties from the preceding calendar
year must be filed during the month of July, and no distribution will be made to any party failing to make a timely filing.
Cable claims may be filed jointly or singly as the submitting parties choose.

Content of Claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 252.3 describes the required content of a claim, and is more detailed than the former Tribunal's requirements.
The Copyright Office is not yet prepared to issue claimant forms, and each claimant must therefore take care to insure
that information meeting all the requirements of section 252.3 is contained in each claim. Each claim must state the
full legal name of the claimant, and its address, telephone number and facsimile number, if any. The claimant must
also identify at least one of its copyrighted works that was subject to a secondary transmission by a cable system in
the previous calendar year, thereby establishing a basis for a claim to royalties. If the claim is a joint claim, there
must be a concise statement of the authorization for filing the joint claim. For this purpose, performing rights societies
will not be required to obtain separate authorizations from their individual members beyond their standard agreements.

<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All claims must be signed by the claimant or a duly authorized representative, and the Copyright Office must be notified
of name and/or address changes within 30 days of the change. Failure to notify the Office in a timely fashion is grounds
for dismissal of the claim. If a party submitting an individual claim wishes to change it to a joint claim, the Office
must be notified within 14 days of the agreement to submit a joint claim. All joint claimants must make available to
the Copyright Office and, if applicable, to a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel_a list of all individual claimants
covered by the joint claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance With Statutory Dates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 252.4 underscores the importance of complying with the July filing period. A claim is considered timely filed
if it is received by the Copyright Office during normal business hours in July, or is properly addressed to the Copyright
Office with correct postage and bears a July U.S. postmark. Claims dated only with a business meter and not received
in July are untimely. Absolutely no claim will be accepted if it is filed by facsimile transmission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proof of Fixation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, section 252.5 clarifies that the Copyright Office will not require claimants to file copies of their works.
In the event that the issue of fixation arises, the CARP conducting the proceeding will resolve the controversy on
the basis of affidavits and other appropriate documentary evidence. No affidavits need be submitted, however, unless
requested by the Panel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Parts 253&hyph;256
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parts 253 through 256 adopt, with only minor technical changes, the provisions of the former Tribunal's regulations
for use of copyrighted works by noncommercial educational broadcasters, adjustment of royalty rates for phonorecord
players (jukeboxes), adjustment of royalty rates for making and distributing phonorecords, and adjustment of royalty
rates for the cable compulsory license. These actions contain current royalty rates, as adopted by the Tribunal,
and will be amended by the Copyright Office in the future as new rates are set by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
or the Librarian of Congress, as the case may be.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In adopting Parts 253&hyph;256, several regulations of the former Tribunal are being repealed. Former Part 303,
entitled ``Access to Phonorecord Players (Jukeboxes)'' is repealed, as is former Part 305, ``Claims to Phonorecord
Player (Jukebox) Royalty Fees.'' The need for these parts was eliminated by the Reform Act's repeal of the section
116 jukebox compulsory license and replacement with section 116A governing negotiated licenses. The need for former
Tribunal Part 306, however, was not eliminated since it contains royalty rates applicable to periods dating back
to January 1, 1982. These rates must be preserved, even though the compulsory license has now been eliminated for future
years, in the event that parties making use of copyrighted works during the periods covered by the license may now,
or in the future, make initial or supplementary payments. Part 254 therefore adopts Part 306 of the former Tribunal's
rules, with only one minor technical change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Part 257_Filing of Claims to Satellite Carrier Royalty Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 257 implements exactly the same requirements for 17 U.S.C. 119 satellite carrier royalty claims that Part 252
adopts for cable claims. Like those for cable, claims in these cases must be filed during the month of July, and may be
filed singly or jointly. Section 257.6 makes it clear that, although cable and satellite have the same filing period,
separate claims must be filed by a party seeking both cable and satellite royalty fees for the same calendar year. Any
single claim which attempts to file for both royalty funds will be dismissed.

E. Parts 258&hyph;259
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parts 258 and 259 govern the adjustment of royalty fees for the satellite carrier compulsory license and the filing
of digital audio claims, respectively. These two parts adopt Parts 310 and 311 of the former Tribunal's rules with
only minor technical changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) If the matter relates solely to the internal practices of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

discretion on the issue; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the matter involves privileged or confidential trade secrets or financial information; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the result might be to accuse any person of a crime or formally censure him or her; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If there would be clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If there would be disclosure of investigatory records compiled for law enforcement, or information that if written
would be contained in such records, and to the extent disclosure would:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source or, in the case of a criminal investigation or a national security
intelligence investigation, disclose confidential information furnished only by a confidential source; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

unless the Panel has already disclosed the concept or nature of the proposed action, or is required by law to make disclosure
before taking final action; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the matter concerns a CARP's participation in a civil action or proceeding or in an action in a foreign court or
international tribunal, or an arbitration, or a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
554, or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing; or

Procedure for closed meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Meetings may be closed, or information withheld from the public, only by a recorded vote of a majority of arbitrators
of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Each question, either to close a meeting or to withhold information, must
be voted on separately, unless a series of meetings is involved, in which case the Panel may vote to keep the discussions
closed for 30 days, starting from the first meetings. If the panel feels that information about a closed meeting must
be withheld, the decision to do so must also be the subject of a recorded vote.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Before a discussion to close a meeting or withhold information, the chairperson of a CARP must certify that such
an action is permissible, and the chairperson shall cite the appropriate exemption under &sect;251.13. This certification
shall be included in the announcement of the meeting and be maintained as part of the record of proceedings of the Panel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Following such a vote, the following information shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) All meetings closed to the public shall be subject either to a complete transcript or, in the case of &sect;251.13(h)
and at the discretion of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, detailed minutes. Detailed minutes shall describe
all matters discussed, identify all documents considered, summarize action taken as well as the reasons for it, and
record all roll call votes as well as any views expressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Such transcripts or minutes shall be kept by the Copyright Office for at least 2 years, or for at least 1 year after
the conclusion of the proceedings, whichever is later. Any portion of transcripts of meetings which the chairperson
of a CARP does not feel is exempt from disclosure under &sect;251.13 will ordinarily be available to the public within
20 working days of the meeting. Transcripts or minutes of closed meetings will be reviewed by the chairperson at the
end of the proceedings of the Panel and, if at that time he or she determines that they should be disclosed, he or she will
resubmit the question to the Panel to gain authorization for their disclosure.

within 3 working days of the meeting's announcement. Otherwise the request will not be heeded, and the person making
the request will be so notified. An original and three copies of the request must be submitted.

(c) For a CARP to act on a request to open or close a meeting, the question must be brought to a vote before the Panel. If
the request is granted, an amended meeting announcement will be issued and the person making the request notified.
If a vote is not taken, or if after a vote the request is denied, said person will also be notified promptly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart governs the proceedings of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels for the adjustment of royalty rates
and distribution of royalty fees convened under 17 U.S.C. 803. This subpart does not apply to other arbitration proceedings
specified by 17 U.S.C., or to actions or rulemakings of the Librarian of Congress or the Register of Copyrights, except
where expressly provided in the provisions of this subpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The formal hearings that will be conducted under the rules of this subpart are rate adjustment hearings and royalty
fee distribution hearings. All parties intending to participate in a hearing of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty
Panel must file a notice of their intention. A CARP may also, on its own motion or on the petition of an interested party,
hold other proceedings it considers necessary to the exercise of its functions, subject to the provisions of &sect;251.7.
All such proceedings will be governed by the rules of this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) During the time periods provided in &sect;251.45(a) and &sect;251.63, any party to the proceeding may petition
the Librarian of Congress to have the determination of the controversy rendered strictly on the submission of written
pleadings. Replies to such petitions may be filed within 14 days. The Librarian, upon recommendation of the Register
of Copyright, shall rule on the petition prior to the declaration of a controversy and initiation of a proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of an individual proceeding, the provisions of this subpart may be suspended or waived, in whole or in
part, by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel upon a showing of good cause, subject to the provisions of &sect;251.7.
Such suspension or waiver shall apply only to the proceeding of the CARP taking that action, and shall not be binding
on any other Panel or proceeding. Where procedures have not been specifically prescribed in this subpart, and subject
to &sect;251.7, the Panel shall follow procedures consistent with 5 U.S.C. chapter 5, subchapter II.

conducted under 17 U.S.C. 1010 shall begin with the filing of written direct cases of the parties who have filed a notice
of intent to participate in the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The written direct case shall include all testimony, including each witness's background and qualifications,
along with all the exhibits to be presented in the direct case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(d) In the case of a royalty fee distribution proceeding, each party must state in the written direct case its percentage
or dollar claim to the fund. In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, each part must state its requested rate. No
party will be precluded from revising its claim or its requested rate at any time during the proceeding up to the filing
of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (e) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in the written direct case without a sponsoring witness, except

cause shown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (f) Written rebuttal cases of the parties shall be filed at a time designated by a CARP upon conclusion of the hearing

Librarian of Congress motions regarding precontroversy exchange of documents or discovery, objections to any party's
royalty claim or petition, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings, on any proper ground. Any party to the
proceeding wishing to file a response to such motion or objection may do so within 14 days. The Librarian, upon recommendation
of the Register of Copyrights, shall rule on the motion or objection prior to the declaration of a controversy and initiation
of an arbitration proceeding.

written exhibits and testimony. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After the filing of the written cases, any party may file with a CARP objections to any portion of another party's
written case on any proper ground including, without limitation, relevance, competency, and failure to provide
underlying documents. If an objection is apparent from the face of a written case, that objection must be raised or
the party may thereafter be precluded from raising such an objection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) At the opening of a hearing conducted by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the chairperson shall announce
the subject under consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Only the arbitrators of a CARP, or counsel as provided in this chapter, shall question witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Subject to the vote of the CARP, the chairperson shall have responsibility for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Setting the order of presentation of evidence and appearance of witnesses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Administering oaths and affirmations to all witnesses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Announcing the Panel's ruling on objections and motions and all rulings with respect to introducing or excluding
documentary or other evidence. In all cases, whether there are an even or odd number of arbitrators sitting at the hearing,
it takes a majority vote to grant a motion or sustain an objection. A split vote will result in the denial of the motion
or the overruling of the objection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Regulating the course of the proceedings and the decorum of the parties and their counsel, and insuring that the
proceedings are fair and impartial; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Announcing the schedule of subsequent hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each arbitrator may examine any witness or call upon any party for the production of additional evidence at any
time. Further examination, cross-examination, or redirect examination by counsel relevant to the inquiry initiated
by an arbitrator may be allowed by a Panel, but only to the limited extent that it is directly responsive to the inquiry
of the arbitrator.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Witnesses shall first be examined by their attorney and by opposing attorneys for their competency to support
their written testimony and exhibits (voir dire).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Witnesses may then summarize, highlight or read their testimony. However, witnesses may not materially supplement
or alter their written testimony except to correct it, unless the Panel expands the witness' testimony to complete
the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Parties are entitled to raise objections to evidence on any proper ground during the course of the hearing, including
an objection that an opposing party has not furnished nonprivileged underlying documents. However, they may not
raise objections that were apparent from the face of a written case and could have been raised before the hearing without
leave from the Panel. See &sect;251.45(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) All written testimony and exhibits will be received into the record, except any to which the Panel sustains an objection;
no separate motion will be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) If the Panel rejects or excludes testimony and an offer of proof is made, the offer of proof shall consist of a statement
of the substance of the evidence which it is contended would have been adduced. In the case of documentary or written
evidence, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Panel shall discourage the presentation of cumulative evidence, and may limit the number of witnesses that
may be heard on behalf of any one party on any one issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Parties are entitled to conduct cross-examination and redirect examination. Cross-examination is limited
to matters raised on direct examination. Redirect examination is limited to matters raised on cross-examination.
The Panel, however, may limit cross-examination and redirect examination if in its judgment this evidence or examination
would be cumulative or cause undue delay. Conversely, this subsection does not restrict the discretion of the Panel
to expand the scope of cross-examination or redirect examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Documents that have not been exchanged in advance may be shown to a witness on cross-examination. However, copies
of such documents must be distributed to the Panel and to other participants or their counsel at hearing before being
shown to the witness at the time of cross-examination, unless the Panel directs otherwise. If the document is not,
or will not be, supported by a witness for the cross-examining party, that document can be used solely to impeach the
witness's direct testimony and cannot itself be relied upon in findings of fact as rebutting the witness' direct testimony.
However, upon leave from the Panel, the document may be admitted as evidence without a sponsoring witness if official
notice is proper, or if, in the Panel's view, the cross-examined witness is the proper sponsoring witness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) A CARP will encourage individuals or groups with the same or similar interests in a proceeding to select a single
representative to conduct their examination and cross-examination for them. However, if there is no agreement on
the selection of a representative, each individual or group will be allowed to conduct its own examination and cross-examination,
but only on issues affecting its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not repetitious or cumulative
of the questioning of their parties within the group.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Admissibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In any public hearing before a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, evidence that is not unduly repetitious or cumulative
and is relevant and material shall be admissible. The testimony of any witness will not be considered evidence in a
proceeding unless the witness has been sworn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Documentary evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evidence that is submitted in the form of documents or detailed data and information shall be presented as exhibits.
Relevant and material matter embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant or not intended
as evidence must be plainly designated as the matter offered in evidence, and the immaterial or irrelevant parts shall
be marked clearly so as to show they are not intended as evidence. In cases where a document in which material and relevant
matter occurs is of such bulk that it would unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification
and the relevant and material parts, once properly authenticated, may be read into the record. If the Panel desires,
a true copy of the material and relevant matter may be presented in extract form, and submitted as evidence. Anyone
presenting documents as evidence must present copies to all other participants at the hearing or their attorneys,
and afford them an opportunity to examine the documents in their entirety and offer into evidence any other portion
that may be considered material and relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Documents filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or Copyright Office. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the matter offered in evidence is contained in documents already on file with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
or the Copyright Office, the documents themselves need not be produced, but may instead be referred to according to
how they have been filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public documents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a public document such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic data, is offered
in evidence either in whole or in part, and if the document has been issued by an Executive Department, a legislative
agency or committee, or a Federal administrative agency (Government-owned corporations included), and is proved
by the party offering it to be reasonably available to the public, the document need not be produced physically, but
may be offered instead by identifying the document and signaling the relevant parts.

In any proceeding for the distribution of satellite carrier royalty fees, the Copyright Office shall not require
the filing by claimants of tangible fixations of works in whole or in part. In the event that a controversy concerning
the actual fixation of a work in a tangible medium of expression as required by the Copyright Code, the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panel conducting the distribution proceeding shall resolve such controversy on the basis of affidavits
by appropriate operational personnel and other appropriate documentary evidence, and by such oral testimony as
the Panel may deem necessary. Affidavits submitted by claimants should establish that the work for which the claim
was submitted was fixed in its entirety, and should state the nature of the work, the title of the program, the duration
of the program, and the date of fixation. No such affidavits need be filed with a CARP unless requested by that Panel.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''),
as amended, requires that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') include
a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,
or contaminants throughout the United States. The National Priorities List (``NPL'') constitutes this list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') proposes to add new sites to the NPL. This 16th proposed revision to
the NPL includes 16 sites in the General Superfund Section and 10 in the Federal Facilities Section. The identification
of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to
assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what
CERCLA-financed remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. This action does not affect the 1,192 sites currently
listed on the NPL (1,069 in the General Superfund Section and 123 in the Federal Facilities Section). However, it does
increase the number of proposed sites to 97 (67 in the General Superfund Section and 30 in the Federal Facilities Section).
Final and proposed sites now total 1,289.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.
9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act'') in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA
was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law No. 99&hyph;499,
100 stat. 1613 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180),
pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines
and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,
or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases
or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action.'' As defined in CERCLA
section 101(24), remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involves response actions that are consistent
with a permanent remedy for a release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mechanisms for determining priorities for possible remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under
CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') and financed by other persons are included in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)
(55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high
on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which is appendix A of 40 CFR part 300. On December 14, 1990 (55 FR 51532), EPA
promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The revised HRS evaluates
four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate
the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants to pose a threat to human
health or the environment. Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless
of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable,
the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest
danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed whether
or not they score above 28.50, if all of the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a
health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority than to use its removal authority
to respond to the release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these criteria, and pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA promulgates a list
of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants
throughout the United States. That list, which is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL'').
CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.''
The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably
as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised
at least annually. A site may undergo CERCLA-financed remedial action only after it is placed on the NPL, as provided
in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then,
most recently on October 14, 1992 (57 FR 47180). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPL includes two sections, one of sites being evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''),
and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive
Order 12580 and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying out most response actions at facilities
under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible for preparing an HRS score and determining
if the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly
less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section includes those facilities at which EPA is not the
lead agency.

Deletions/Cleanups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP
in 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 56 sites from the General Superfund
Section of the NPL, most recently the Suffern Village Well Field, Village of Suffern, New York (58 FR 30989, May 28,
1993), Pesticide Lab, Yakima, Washington (58 FR 46087, September 1, 1993), LaBounty Site, Charles City, Iowa (58
FR 50218, October 6, 1993), Aidex Corporation, Council Bluffs, Iowa (58 FR 54297, October 21, 1993), Hydro-Flex Inc.,
Topeka, KS (58 FR 59369, November 9, 1993) and Plymouth Harbor/Cannon Engineering Corp., Plymouth, Massachusetts
(58 FR 61029, November 19, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites
and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify
for the CCL when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have
been achieved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g.,
institutional controls); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL. Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 55 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research
and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional
162 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but one from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of October 1993, the CCL consists
of 217 sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of September 30, 1993,
EPA had conducted 591 removal actions at NPL sites, and 1,734 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals
is available from the Superfund hotline.

Pursuant to the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c), this document proposes to add 26 sites to the NPL. The General Superfund Section
includes 1,069 sites, and the Federal Facilities Section includes 123 sites, for a total of 1,192 sites on the NPL.
Final and proposed sites now total 1,289. These numbers reflect EPA's decision to voluntarily remove the Hexcel Corporation
site, in Livermore, CA, from the NPL.

With the exception of Raymark Industries, Inc. (Stratford, Connecticut), Lower Ecorse Creek Dump (Wyandotte, Michigan),
and Tennessee Products (Chanttanooga, Tennessee) which are sites being proposed based on the ATSDR health advisory
criteria, and Boomsnub/Airco (Vancouver, Washington) which has been designated as a State top priority, the Headquarters
docket for this rule contains HRS score sheets for each proposed site; a Documentation Record for each site describing
the information used to compute the score; pertinent information for any site affected by particular statutory requirements
or EPA listing policies; and a list of documents referenced in the Documentation Record. Each Regional docket for
this rule, except for the three ATSDR health advisory sites and the State top priority mentioned above, contains all
of the information in the Headquarters docket for sites in that Region, plus the actual reference documents containing
the data principally relied upon and cited by EPA in calculating or evaluating the HRS scores for sites in that Region.
These reference documents are available only in the Regional dockets. For the three sites proposed on the basis of
health advisory criteria, both the Headquarters and Regional dockets contain the public health advisories issued
by ATSDR, and EPA memoranda supporting the findings that in each case the release poses a significant threat to public
health and that it would be more cost-effective to use remedial rather than removal authorities at the site. For the
site that has been designated a top priority by the State, both the Headquarters and Regional dockets contain supporting
documentation. Interested parties may view documents, by appointment only, in the Headquarters or the appropriate
Regional docket or copies may be requested from the Headquarters or appropriate Regional docket. An informal written
request, rather than a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act, should be the ordinary procedure for obtaining
copies of any of these documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considers all comments received during the comment period. During the comment period, comments are placed in
the Headquarters docket and are available to the public on an ``as received'' basis. A complete set of comments will
be available for viewing in the Regional docket approximately one week after the formal comment period closes. Comments
received after the comment period closes will be available in the Headquarters docket and in the Regional docket on
an ``as received'' basis.

during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In past rules, EPA has attempted to respond to late comments, or when that was not practicable, to read all late comments
and address those that brought to the Agency's attention a fundamental error in the scoring of a site. (See, most recently,
57 FR 4824 (February 7, 1992)). Although EPA intends to pursue the same policy with sites in this rule, EPA can guarantee
that it will consider only those comments postmarked by the close of the formal comment period. EPA cannot delay a final
listing decision solely to accommodate consideration of late comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain instances, interested parties have written to EPA concerning sites which were not at that time proposed
to the NPL. If those sites are later proposed to the NPL, parties should review their earlier concerns and, if still
appropriate, resubmit those concerns for consideration during the formal comment period. Site-specific correspondence
received prior to the period of formal proposal and comment will not generally be included in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96&hyph;848,
96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)) states the primary purpose of the NPL:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities
and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or site on the list does
not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities of its owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake
any action, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent government action in the form of remedial actions
or enforcement actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriate procedural
safeguards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management tool. The identification
of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to
assess the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine
what CERCLA remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites that EPA
believes warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may, to the extent potentially responsible parties
are identifiable at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financed
remedial action.

Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After initial discovery of a site at which a release or threatened release may exist, EPA begins a series of increasingly
complex evaluations. The first step, the Preliminary Assessment (``PA''), is a low-cost review of existing information
to determine if the site poses a threat to public health or the environment. If the site presents a serious imminent
threat, EPA may take immediate removal action. If the PA shows that the site presents a threat but not an imminent threat,
EPA will generally perform a more extensive study called the Site Inspection (``SI''). The SI involves collecting
additional information to better understand the extent of the problem at the site, screen out sites that will not qualify
for the NPL, and obtain data necessary to calculate an HRS score for sites which warrant placement on the NPL and further
study. EPA may perform removal actions at any time during the process. To date EPA has completed approximately 35,000
PAs and approximately 17,000 SIs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990) limits expenditure of the Trust Fund for remedial actions
to sites on the NPL. However, EPA may take enforcement actions under CERCLA or other applicable statutes against responsible
parties regardless of whether the site is on the NPL, although, as a practical matter, the focus of EPA's CERCLA enforcement
actions has been and will continue to be on NPL sites. Similarly, in the case of CERCLA removal actions, EPA has the authority
to act at any site, whether listed or not, that meets the criteria of the NCP in 40 CFR 300.415(b)(2) (55 FR 8842, March
8, 1990). EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using all the appropriate response and/or enforcement actions
available to the Agency, including authorities other than CERCLA. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis
whether to take enforcement or other action under CERCLA or other authorities prior to undertaking response action,
proceed directly with Trust Fund-financed response actions and seek to recover response costs after cleanup, or
do both. To the extent feasible, once sites are on the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for CERCLA-financed
response action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federal initiatives. EPA will take into account
which approach is more likely to accomplish cleanup of the site most expeditiously while using CERCLA's limited resources
as efficiently as possible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the ranking of sites by HRS scores is considered, it does not, by itself, determine the sequence in which EPA
funds remedial response actions, since the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient to determine
either the extent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site (40 CFR 300.425(b)(2), 55 FR
8845, March 8, 1990). Additionally, resource constraints may preclude EPA from evaluating all HRS pathways; only
those presenting significant risk or sufficient to make a site eligible for the NPL may be evaluated. Moreover, the
sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency's attention first, so that addressing sites strictly
on the basis of ranking would in some cases require stopping work at sites where it was already underway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More detailed studies of a site are undertaken in the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (``RI/FS'') that
typically follows listing. The purpose of the RI/FS is to assess site conditions and evaluate alternatives to the
extent necessary to select a remedy (40 CFR 300.430(a)(2) (55 FR 8846, March 8, 1990)). It takes into account the amount
of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants released into the environment, the risk to affected populations
and environment, the cost to remediate contamination at the site, and the response actions that have been taken by
potentially responsible parties or others. Decisions on the type and extent of response action to be taken at these
sites are made in accordance with 40 CFR 300.415 (55 FR 8842, March 8, 1990) and 40 CFR 300.430 (55 FR 8846, March 8, 1990).
After conducting these additional studies, EPA may conclude that initiating a CERCLA remedial action using the Trust
Fund at some sites on the NPL is not appropriate because of more pressing needs at other sites, or because a private party
cleanup is already underway pursuant to an enforcement action. Given the limited resources available in the Trust
Fund, the Agency must carefully balance the relative needs for response at the numerous sites it has studied. It is
also possible that EPA will conclude after further analysis that the site does not warrant remedial action.

 for placement on the NPL (or even sites that have not been proposed for placement on the NPL) pursuant to the Agency's
removal authority under CERCLA, as outlined in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.415. Although an RI/FS generally is conducted
at a site after it has been placed on the NPL, in a number of circumstances the Agency elects to conduct an RI/FS at a site
proposed for placement on the NPL in preparation for a possible Trust Fund-financed remedial action, such as when
the Agency believes that a delay may create unnecessary risks to public health or the environment. In addition, the
Agency may conduct an RI/FS to assist in determining whether to conduct a removal or enforcement action at a site.

The purpose of the NPL is merely to identify releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that are priorities
for further evaluation. The Agency believes that it would be neither feasible nor consistent with this limited purpose
for the NPL to attempt to describe releases in precise geographical terms. The term ``facility'' is broadly defined
in CERCLA to include any area where a hazardous substance has ``come to be located'' (CERCLA section 101(9)), and the
listing process is not intended to define or reflect boundaries of such facilities or releases. Site names are provided
for general identification purposes only. Knowledge of the geographic extent of sites will be refined as more information
is developed during the RI/FS and even during implementation of the remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the NPL does not assign liability or define the geographic extent of a release, a listing need not be amended
if further research into the contamination at a site reveals new information as to its extent. This is further explained
in preambles to past NPL rules, most recently February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5598).

Sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorize the Fund to reimburse certain parties for necessary costs of
performing a response action. As is described in more detail at 58 FR 5460 (January 21, 1993), 40 CFR part 307, there
are two major limitations placed on the payment of claims for response actions. First, only private parties, certain
potentially responsible parties (including States and political subdivisions), and certain foreign entities
are eligible to file such claims. Second, all response actions under sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) must receive
prior approval, or ``preauthorization,'' from EPA.

III. Contents of This Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Table 1 identifies the 16 NPL sites in the General Superfund Section and Table 2 identifies the 10 NPL sites in the Federal
Facilities Section being proposed in this rule. Both tables follow this preamble. With the exception of Raymark Industries,
Inc. (Stratford, Connecticut), Lower Ecorse Creek Dump (Wyandotte, Michigan), and Tennessee Products (Chattanooga,
Tennessee) which are sites being proposed based on ATSDR health advisory criteria, and Boomsnub/Airco (Vancouver,
Washington) which has been designated as a State top priority, all sites are proposed based on HRS scores of 28.50 or
above. The sites in Table 1 are listed alphabetically by State, for ease of identification, with group number identified
to provide an indication of relative ranking. To determine group number, sites on the NPL are placed in groups of 50;
for example, a site in Group 4 of this proposal has a score that falls within the range of scores covered by the fourth
group of 50 sites on the General Superfund Section of the NPL. Sites in the Federal Facilities Section are also presented
by group number based on groups of 50 sites in the General Superfund Section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among'' the known releases or threatened releases
of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain
enumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to
use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for possible
remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA has chosen not to place certain types of sites
on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later determines that sites not
listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may place them on the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The listing policies and statutory requirements of relevance to this proposed rule cover sites subject to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'') (42 U.S.C. 6901&hyph;6991i) and Federal facility sites. These policies
and requirements are explained below and have been explained in greater detail in previous rulemakings (56 FR 5598,
February 11, 1991).

Releases From Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's policy is that non-Federal sites subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities will not, in general,
be placed on the NPL. However, EPA will list certain categories of RCRA sites subject to Subtitle C corrective action
authorities, as well as other sites subject to those authorities, if the Agency concludes that doing so best furthers
the aims of the NPL/RCRA policy and the CERCLA program. EPA has explained these policies in detail in the past (51 FR
21054, June 10, 1986; 53 FR 23978, June 24, 1988; 54 FR 41000, October 4, 1989; 56 FR 5602, February 11, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with EPA's NPL/RCRA policy, EPA is proposing to add one site to the General Superfund Section of the NPL
that may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities, the Raymark Industries, Inc. site in Stratford,
Connecticut, which is being proposed based on ATSDR health advisory criteria. Material has been placed in the public
docket establishing that the facility operated as a hazardous waste generator and land disposal facility. Raymark
Industries, Inc. is a RCRA Subtitle C regulated facility which has initiated bankruptcy proceedings. Listing of
the Raymark Industries, Inc. site on the NPL under these circumstances is consistent with EPA's NPL/RCRA deferral
policy.

Releases From Federal Facility Sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 13, 1989 (54 FR 10520), the Agency announced a policy for placing Federal facility sites on the NPL if they meet
the eligibility criteria (e.g., an HRS score of 28.50 or greater), even if the Federal facility also is subject to the
corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C. In that way, those sites could be cleaned up under CERCLA, if appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Raymark Industries, Inc. in Stratford, Connecticut, Lower Ecorse Creek Dump in Wyandotte, Michigan, and Tennessee
Products in Chattanooga, Tennessee, are being proposed for the NPL on the basis of section 425(c)(3) of the NCP, 40
CFR 300.425(c)(3) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990).

Raymark Industries, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Raymark Industries, Inc. site includes the Raymark Industries, Inc. facility and other locations where Raymark
Industries, Inc. facility waste has come to be located and that EPA determines pose a significant threat to public
health. The Raymark Industries, Inc. facility comprises about 500,000 square feet of office, storage and production
space on 33.4 acres next to Interstate Route 95. A public recreation park containing a baseball diamond and recreation
field is located immediately northwest of the site. The facility began operations at this location in 1919 and primarily
manufactured asbestos brake linings and other automotive asbestos products until operations ceased in 1989. The
facility operated as a hazardous waste generator and land disposal facility. The hazardous waste produced on-site
consisted primarily of lead-asbestos dust, metals and solvents. From 1919 to July 1984, Raymark Industries, Inc.
used a system of lagoons to attempt to capture the waste lead and asbestos dust produced by its manufacturing process.
Over this 65 year period, these lagoon systems were located throughout the western and central areas of the facility.
As the lagoons filled with sludge they were covered with asphalt and often built upon. Dredged materials were also
landfilled at other locations, including the adjacent ballfield. Interim actions intended to stabilize waste have
been conducted at the Raymark Industries, Inc. facility and the ballfield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An intensive surficial sampling program of the other locations where waste from Raymark Industries, Inc. is known
or suspected to have been received and used as fill was instituted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection and EPA in April 1993. Based upon the analytical results of this activity, which indicated concentrations
of lead, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ATSDR issued a public health advisory on May 26, 1993 for
``Raymark Industries/Stratford Asbestos Sites''. The advisory recommended dissociation of the public from areas
where exposure to Raymark Industries, Inc. waste at levels of health concern can occur. The presence of dioxin in Raymark
Industries, Inc. waste has subsequently been confirmed. The advisory was based on the concern that people could be
exposed to site-related contaminants through inhalation, direct dermal contact, ingestion of waste present in
the soil, and consumption of potentially contaminated area seafood.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results from samples collected to determine the lateral extent of contamination at known disposal locations
has served as the basis for supplemental ATSDR site-specific Health Consultations. ATSDR recommended immediate
response actions based upon the finding of imminent health threats. Sampling to determine the vertical extent of
contamination at these disposal areas is presently being conducted to expedite complete site characterization.
Site characterization and initiation of mitigation actions at known locations and at newly discovered sites are
being prioritized for early action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human health and anticipates that it will be more cost-effective
to use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the site. This finding is set out in a memorandum
dated November 3, 1993, from Merrill S. Hohman, Region 1 Waste Management Division Director, to Larry Reed, Hazardous
Site Evaluation Division Director. This memorandum and the ATSDR advisory are available in the Superfund docket
for this proposed rule. Based on this information, and the references in support of proposal, EPA believes that the
Raymark Industries, Inc. site is appropriate for the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3).

Lower Ecorse Creek Dump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site is located in Wyandotte, Wayne County, Michigan. The site consists of the residence
at 470 North Drive and three neighboring parcels of land. The site occupies a level area with the back of the lots abutting
the Ecorse River. During the period between 1945 and 1955, and prior to the house at 470 North Drive being built, the
low lying swampy area of the creek was filled with material from local industries. Some of the fill material contained
what has been confirmed as ferric ferrocyanide, commonly referred to as ``Prussian Blue''. The blue soil was also
found across the street at 471 North Drive, approximately two feet below the surface and the owner of the residence
at 469 North Drive also reported that he found the blue soil in his yard. In addition, there are two vacant lots east of
470 North Drive where Prussian Blue is exposed. Neighborhood children have used portions of these lots as a go-cart
track and wearing of the topsoil by the go-carts has exposed the Prussian Blue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA was contacted by the Wayne County Health Department on October 25, 1989. EPA tasked its Technical Assistance
Team (TAT) on October 27, 1989, to conduct a site investigation and sampling. Sampling results were provided to ATSDR
for review and assessment. ATSDR's review on November 22, 1989, concluded that ``The levels of cyanide found in the
soil do present an urgent public health threat. Steps to eliminate any direct contact with the contaminated soil need
to be taken immediately.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following ATSDR's determination that the presence of cyanide-contaminated wastes in an unrestricted residential
area presented an immediate and significant public health threat, EPA's Emergency Response Branch initiated removal
activities. On December 4, 1989, work commenced to cover the contaminated areas with six inches of clean topsoil and
fill in areas of the driveway and sidewalk which had been previously excavated by the property owner. This action eliminated
physical contact with Prussian Blue and related cyanide compounds which had spread throughout the area. The initial
action was completed in the summer of 1990 with the establishment of a vegetative cover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final ATSDR Health Advisory which was released on August 13, 1993, recommended the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Immediately dissociate the affected residents from cyanide contamination, which is at levels of health concern
in residential subsurface soils; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Implement permanent measures to remediate the contamination as appropriate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider including the Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site on the EPA National Priorities List or, using other statutory
or regulatory authorities as appropriate, take other steps to characterize the site and take necessary action.

Additional recommendations by ATSDR include conducting a door-to-door well survey and well sampling to determine

subsurface soil to prevent human contact with contaminated soils and released cyanide gas.

EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human health and anticipates that it will be more cost-effective
to use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the site considering the costs and time involved
in an extensive groundwater study and potential groundwater remediation. This finding is set out in a memorandum
dated August 30, 1993, from William E. Muno, Region 5 Waste Management Division Director, to Larry Reed, Hazardous
Site Evaluation Division Director. This memorandum and the ATSDR advisory are available in the Superfund docket
for this proposed rule. Based on this information, and the references in support of proposal, EPA believes that the
Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site is appropriate for the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3).

The Tennessee Products site, is an aggregation of Southern Coke Corporation (Southern Coke), Chattanooga Creek
Tar Deposit Site and Hamill Road Dump No. 2. The site is located in a heavily populated, low-income, urban and industrial
area in the Chattanooga Creek (the creek) basin in Chattanooga, Hamilton County, Tennessee. The site consists of
the former Tennessee Products coke plant and its associated uncontrolled coal-tar dumping grounds in Chattanooga
Creek and its floodplain. Uncontrolled dumping of coal-tar wastes has contaminated the facility, groundwater resources
underlying the facility, and surface water resources downstream of the facility including wetlands and fisheries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former Tennessee Products coke plant (a.k.a. Southern Coke) is located at 4800 Central Avenue, south of Hamill/Hooker
Road and approximately one mile west of the creek. The coal-tar wastes are located along an approximate 2.5 mile section
of the creek extending from just upstream of Hamill Road bridge to the creek's confluence with Dobbs Branch. The coal-tar
deposits are the result of dumping coal-tar wastes directly into the creek and onto the floodplain within the immediate
vicinity of the creek channel. The largest coal-tar deposits have been found in the creek bed and along its banks within
a 1 mile segment of the creek between Hamill Road and 38th Street. Analyses for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) as well as visual inspection of sediment cores confirm that coal-tar has heavily contaminated this segment
of the creek plus an additional 1.5 miles of the creek downstream from this segment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATSDR issued a Public Health Advisory for the Tennessee Products Site on August 20, 1993, based on the chemical and
physical hazard presented by the coal-tar deposits at the site. The Advisory recommends the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Dissociate residents from the coal-tar deposits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Continue site characterization to address the potential for migration of contaminants; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider the Tennessee Products Site for inclusion on the NPL; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) As appropriate, consider other coal-tar contaminated sites along the creek for inclusion on the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have been conducted on Chattanooga Creek on several occasions by EPA and other agencies since 1973. Several
of these studies indicate that coal-tar constituents have contaminated the creek and its sediments. The latest of
these studies, conducted in 1992 by EPA, has revealed the extent of the coal-tar dumping along the creek. This new information,
in combination with historical file information, supports the aggregation of the above mentioned sites. The aggregation
criteria is discussed in a memo to the file, from Loften Carr, Site Assessment Manager, EPA Region 4, dated June 8, 1993,
which is included in the nomination package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historical sampling and aerial photographic evidence indicate that the tar was dumped into the creek, on the banks
and in areas near the creek over several years during the 1940s and 1950s. During World War II, the U.S. Government purchased
the Tennessee Products facility and operated it for the war effort. The facility was sold back to the company after
the end of the war. Due to increased coke production during the war, a substantial increase in waste generated by Tennessee
Products may have strained waste handling procedures practiced by Tennessee Products before 1941. Documentation
of the disposal practices of Tennessee Products during this time period is not available; however, Tennessee Products
maintained a private sewer line which discharged directly into the creek.

This action was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR
51735, October 4, 1993) and Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987). No changes were made in response to
OMB.

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impacts of this action on small entities, or certify
that the action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By small entities, the
Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this rule proposes to revise the NCP, it is not a typical regulatory change since it does not automatically impose
costs. As stated above, proposing sites to the NPL does not in itself require any action by any party, nor does it determine
the liability of any party for the cost of cleanup at the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole.
As a consequence, impacts on any group are hard to predict. A site's proposed inclusion on the NPL could increase the
likelihood of adverse impacts on responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs), but at this time EPA cannot identify
the potentially affected businesses or estimate the number of small businesses that might also be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does expect that placing the sites in this proposed rule on the NPL could significantly affect certain industries,
or firms within industries, that have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problems. However,
EPA does not expect the listing of these sites to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, economic impacts would occur only through enforcement and cost-recovery actions, which EPA takes at
its discretion on a site-by-site basis. EPA considers many factors when determining enforcement actions, including
not only the firm's contribution to the problem, but also its ability to pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizations would be determined on a similar
case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, I hereby certify that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, this proposed regulation does not require a regulatory flexibility
analysis.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 22, 1985 the Coast Guard published an interim final rule (IFR) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 33923) which established structural and performance standards and procedures for approval of hybrid inflatable
personal flotation devices (PFD). This IFR allowed the approval of several hybrid PFD's but not enough devices were
made and sold to make a significant difference in the number of lives saved by this superior performing and more comfortable
PFD. The changes proposed are designed to make hybrid PFD's more affordable and attractive to recreational boaters.
The changes include lowering manufacturing costs by reducing the amount of repetitive testing required. Increases
in buoyancy are proposed to compensate for removing of the Type V criteria of being ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN'' to allow
approval of hybrids a Type I, II, and III. Types I, II, and III are proposed in addition to the existing Type V category.
This SNPRM also proposes approval of hybrids for youths and small children. These proposals are in hopes that hybrid
PFD's will be more widely used and potentially save more lives.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 29, 1985 (50 FR 21878). Corrections to the NPRM were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 18, 1985 (50 FR 25274). The comment period on that proposal ended on July 15, 1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed requirements for both hybrid PFD's and inflatable lifejackets. An interim final rule promulgating
hybrid PFD requirements was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 22, 1985 (50 FR 33923). Corrections to this rule were published on February 4, 1986 (51 FR 4349). Comments
that addressed concerns relating to the hybrid PFD requirements were analyzed and discussed in the August 22, 1985
publication.

Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes changes to the requirements for approving hybrid inflatable PFD's and for the carriage of hybrid
PFD's on commercial vessels. The requirements are self-explanatory and have been included in a list which cites each
specific section number for ease of presentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, the changes proposed by this SNPRM may be incorporated by reference in the regulation by citing an updated
revision to Underwriters Laboratories Standard 1517, Hybrid Personal Flotation Devices.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Primarily these revisions are based on the U.S. Coast Guard's experience in evaluating for approval four models of
hybrids by four different manufacturers. Also considered are the discussions and comments at the 1991 and 1992 meetings
of the Industry Advisory Council (IAC) of Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and the November 11, 1991 National Boating
Safety Advisory Council (NBSAC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This SNPRM proposes approval of hybrid inflatable PFD's for youths and small children. The rule changes would allow
approval of recreational hybrid inflatable PFD's for weight ranges down to 14 kg (30 lb) and commercial hybrid inflatable
PFDs's for persons weighing over 23 kg (50 lb). It is the Coast Guard's position that the required amount of inherent
buoyancy and provision for automatic inflation mechanisms on all hybrids for small children, between 14&hyph;23
kg (30&hyph;50 lb), justifies approval of hybrids in these weight ranges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the requirements in the SNPRM are adopted hybrid PFD's will be approved in ten recreational and four commercial
Type and size categories. Several tables have been added to improve understanding of the various categories. Comments
are requested on the clarity and reader comprehensibility of the proposed requirements for the various Types in this
format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments/revisions are divided into seven areas as follows:

Changes To Make Use of Hybrids More Attractive
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of changes are proposed to make hybrid inflatable PFD's more attractive to recreational boaters and manufacturers.
The intent of the interim final rule was to provide regulations which ensure introduction of hybrid PFD's with little
or no increased risk due to failure of the inflation system. When placed into practice the rules proved too burdensome
to attract many recreational boaters to buy the PFD's and for manufacturers to produce them. As a result production
and use of hybrid PFD's is very limited. To date two manufacturers have actually obtained approval, another is pending
approval, and only one is currently producing. Demand from consumers for hybrid PFD's has been minimal. A market analysis
to determine what advantages or disadvantages consumers may see in hybird PFD's has not been conducted. Information
which may provide insight into this specific area of concern is solicited by the Coast Guard and comments from interested
parties are encouraged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard's efforts to encourage production and use of hybrid PFD's is based upon comments obtained from the
manufacturers of hybrid PFD's during the 1991 and 1992 Underwriters Laboratories Industry Advisory Council and
1991 National Boating Safety Advisory Council. In this light, the Coast Guard proposes to change the following sections
to make hybrids more appealing to boaters and to reduce the regulatory burden placed upon manufacturers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 160.077&hyph;1&blank;Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Discussions at the 1991 Underwriters Laboratory Industry Advisory Conference indicated that consumers are
discouraged from purchasing hybrid PFD's because the REQUIRED TO BE WORN limitation causes legal questions in the
users mind and leaves little flexibility in use of the devices. Also, in May 1992 NBSAC recommended carriage of hybrid
PFD's be allowed without being ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.'' To encourage consumers to purchase_and ultimately wear_hybrid
PFD's the Scope will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's approved as Type I, II, or III devices do not have the restriction
of being REQUIRED TO BE WORN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the interim final rule a hybrid PFD is approved only for adults. The Coast Guard proposed to amend this paragraph
to include hybrid inflatable PFD's for small children weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb), and for youths weighing
23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb). Current regulations require hybrid PFD's with Type I and II performance to have automatic
inflation mechanisms. Hybrid PFD's for use by small children weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb) would be approved
a Type I or II only. Hybrid PFD's approved for use by youths would be aprpoved as Types I, II, III, and V. Hybrid PFD's for
infants, persons weighing less than 14 kg are not proposed.

Section 160.077&hyph;3&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(j) The USCG is proposing adoption of standards for approval of hybrid inflatable PFD's for youths, weighing 23&hyph;40
kg (50&hyph;90 lb), and small children, weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). Under the proposal this paragraph
will be revised to redefine ``Reference Vest'' to include models CKM&hyph;1, child medium; and model CKS&hyph;2,
child small, meeting subpart 160.047 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 160.077&hyph;5&blank;Required to be Worn
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c)(1) Recreational hybrid PFD's approved as Type I, II, or III will meet carriage requirements without being worn.
Therefore, this paragraph will be changed to indicate that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only Type V 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
recreational hybrid PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(2) Commercial hybrid PFD's approved as type I will meet carriage requirements without being worn. Therefore,
this paragraph will be changed to indicate that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only Type V 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
commercial hybrid PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 160.077&hyph;7&blank;Type
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Type I, II, or III hybrid PFD's will not be bound to Type V restrictions. In keeping with the change to &sect;160.077&hyph;1(b)
and (d) this paragraph will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's may be approved as Types I, II, III, or V for persons
in various weight ranges over 23 kg (50 lb.) and as Types I and II for persons weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb).
Type V is not a performance Type. Type V approval means the device is limited to special uses or conditions. Type V hybrid
PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN`` because they have reduced inherent buoyancy. Type V hybrid PFD's will be required
to have Type I, II, or III performance when inflated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The proposed change to hybrid PFD Types approved, discussed in &sect;160.077&hyph;7(a) of this section, authorizes
hybrid PFD's to be approved as Type I, II, III, or V for persons weighing over 23 kg (50 lb) and Types I and II for persons
weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). To be consistent with that change, this paragraph will be revised to indicate
that hybrid PFD's must have at least Type I, II, or III performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Current commercial equipment regulations only require vessels in certain operations to carry PFD's with approved
PFD lights. Because PFD lights are not required for all commercial vessels the requirement that commercial hybrid
PFD's be provided with a light will be deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(13) A proposed requirement will be added to provide Type I recreational hybrid PFD's with a PFD light attachment.
This requirement is intended to provide vessel operators with an option to attach a PFD light, while avoiding damage
to the inflation chamber due to improper light attachment.

Section 160.077&hyph;17&blank;Additional Requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(4) There have been no field complaints concerning failure of the inflation chamber on hybrid inflatable PFD's.
Studies conducted by the USCG Auxiliary (INFLATABLE PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE STUDY, Report No. CG&hyph;M&hyph;5&hyph;81)
and The Boat/U.S. Foundation for Boating Safety (``INFLATABLE PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICE STUDY: An Examination
of Inflatable PFD Performance and Reliability in Public Use'' dated March 11, 1993) have provided additional information
on fully inflatable PFD's which leads the USCG to conclude that one inflation chamber can provide reliability equivalent
to dual chambers in hybrid PFD's. Therefore, the required number of inflation chambers on commercial hybrid PFD's
has been reduced from two to one. However, if the device is marked as a ``lifejacket'' meeting the Safety of Life at Sea
(SOLAS) requirements, two inflation chambers must still be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(8) Adults have a wide range of chest sizes. To provide all passengers with a suitable size PFD, the Coast Guard proposes
to add a requirement that adult commercial hybrid PFD's to be universally sized.(b)(9) Operators of commercial vessels
may be required to have PFD's with approved PFD lights attached. The USCG proposes to drop the requirement for commercial
hybrid PFD's to be provided with an approved PFD light at time of manufacture as discussed in &sect;160.077&hyph;13(d).
Instead, a requirement will be added to provide all commercial hybrid PFD's with a PFD light attachment at time of manufacture.
This change is intended to provide vessel operators with an option to attach a PFD light, relieve manufacturers of
this requirement, and avoid potential damage to the inflation chamber due to improper light attachment in the field.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h)(4) The inflation chambers on hybrid PFD's sometimes fail to hold the required pressure during the over-pressure
test although they remain serviceable. The loss of pressure is often attributed to the stretching of the inflation
chamber material, thus increasing the volume of the chamber and reducing the static pressure reading. This paragraph
revision is proposed to allow prestressing of the inflation chamber.

Changes To Decrease Repetitive Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the required tests are repetitive and increase the cost of producing hybrid PFD's. Elimination of repetitious
testing should reduce manufacturing costs which may in turn encourage increased production. With the intent to encourage
greater production through lower production costs the following changes are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(1)(i) Situations have occurred where extremely small lots (less than 50) of hybrid PFD's have been manufactured.
Requirements for testing each lot by both the manufacturer and laboratory inspector increase the individual cost
of hybrid PFD's produced in such small numbers. Reduction of repetitive testing is proposed by revising this paragraph
to combine the manufacturer's and laboratory inspector's tests when five consecutive lots do not exceed a total of
250 devices. This revision would reduce repetitive testing and decrease production costs without compromising
the safety of approved devices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b)(2)(ii) Historically the number of hybrid PFD's produced has been nominal. In some calendar quarters very small
lots have been produced. The requirement for an independent laboratory inspection every quarter increases production
costs when small lots are produced. Reduction of independent laboratory inspections is proposed by changing this
paragraph to require one inspection annually when not more than five lots, with no more than 1000 devices per lot, are
produced per calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2)(iv) This paragraph will be revised to show reference to paragraph (b)(2)(v) which provides an exception to
the number of required records examinations, and test performance observations when not more than five lots are produced
during any calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2)(v) For the same reasons stated in the proposed changes to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph
will be added to clarify that the number of required records examinations and test performance observations will
be changed to one annually when not more than five lots are produced per calendar year.

(d)(4) As per the reasons stated in proposed changes to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph will
be revised to indicate that when the total production for any five consecutive lots does not exceed 250, the manufacturer's
and inspector's testing and inspection, can be combined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(5) Lots containing small numbers of hybrid PFD's are often produced. Requirements for individual tests and inspections
by both the manufacturer and the independent laboratory increase production costs when small lots are produced.
Reduction of repetitive test and inspections is proposed by authorizing the manufacturer's and inspector's tests
to be run on the same sample at the same time when the total production for any five consecutive lots does not exceed 250.TABLE

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To compensate for removing the REQUIRED TO BE WORN statement the Coast Guard is proposing to add additional inherent
buoyancy for recreational Type I, II, and III hybrid PFD's. Deliberations from the 1991 and 1992 Underwriters Laboratories
Industry Advisory Council meeting and the 1991 National Boating Safety Advisory Council concerning the amount of
additional buoyancy to add to adult hybrid PFD's were considered. The options considered and discussed at those meetings
included increasing the additional buoyancy to 40 N (9 lb) or 45 N (10 lb) in Type V hybrid for adults, weighing over 40
kg (90 lb). The design variations of either are not significant in affecting wear and comfort. The Coast Guard proposes
the 45 N (10 lb) option in order to provide a minimum buoyancy closer to the International Standards Organization (ISO)
proposed minimum standard of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
50 N.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this paragraph the Coast Guard is also proposing buoyancy specifications for recreational hybrid PFD's for persons
weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb) and 23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90 lb). The USCG is not proposing to approve recreational
hybrid inflatable PFD's for infants, weighing less than 14 kg (30 lb).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Coast Guard is proposing to increase the total required buoyancy when inflated for Type I recreational
hybrids for adults. The total buoyancy will be increased to 130 N (30 lb), in lieu of the 100 N (22 lb) inflated buoyancy
requirement for adult Type II, III, or V hybrids. This proposal is based on the Coast Guard's determination that this
buoyancy is the minimum amount necessary to provide performance as required by SOLAS 74/83. Depending on the PFD's
design buoyancy distribution, more buoyancy may be required. Although recreational devices are not required to
meet the requirements of SOLAS 74/83, the greater performance is consistent with the Type I classification and can
be obtained at nominal cost.

(b)(10) In lieu of the Type V requirement, the Coast Guard proposes to increase the minimum inherent and minimum total
buoyancies for adult Type I commercial hybrids. This proposed paragraph revision requires the minimum inherent
buoyancy for adult Type I commercial hybrids to be 70 N (15.5 lb), increased from 45 N (10 lb). The Coast Guard proposes
to increase the amount of total buoyancy for commercial Type I hybrids to 130 N (30 lb) in lieu of the 100 N (22 lb) total
buoyancy requirement for Type V hybrids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition the Coast Guard proposes to increase the required inherent buoyancy in adult type V commercial hybrid
inflatable PFD's. To compensate for the loss of an extra inflation chamber, as discussed under ``

(b)(3)(iii) The Coast Guard proposes to approve hybrid PFD's as Types I, II, III, and V for adult and youth sizes, and
Type I and Type II for small child sizes for use on recreational boats, commercial vessels, or both if they perform accordingly
and the applicable requirements are met. A requirement to test for Type I performance in accordance with the requirements
specified under &sect;160.176&hyph;13(d)(2) will be added if the device is to be so labeled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the suggested approval Types and sizes, the requirements for inflated flotation stability need revision.
The proposed method of change is to adopt revisions to Underwriters Laboratories ``Standard for Safety'', UL 1517,
section 15 ``Inflated Flotation Stability Test.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this paragraph will be revised by specifying that the reference vest used must be the appropriate size
device.

(c)(4)(ii) As presently written in UL 1517, section S8, one inflation chamber must be deflated during the Righting
Action Test. The Coast Guard proposes to change to one chamber the current requirement for two chambers on commercial
hybrid PFD's to reduce costs. This paragraph will be changed to clarify that one inflation chamber has to be deflated
only if there is more than one chamber.

in a ready-to-use condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) Section 160.077&hyph;30(a)(1) (i) and (ii) will be amended to clarify that a total of three inflation medium
cartridges and three water sensitive elements must be provided with the hybrid device when sold. Additionally, a
cartridge and element may or may not be pre-loaded at the time of sale. This paragraph will be added to refer to the marking
requirement specified in &sect;160.077&hyph;15(c)(3)(ii) which will be used when the device is sold without either
an inflation medium cartridge, or a water sensitive element or both pre-loaded into the inflation mechanism.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant under Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). A Regulatory Evaluation
was originally placed in the rulemaking docket in 1985, reviewed in May 1991 with regard to inflatable lifejackets,
and reconsidered in April 1993, concerning hybrid PFD's in association with this SNPRM. The Regulatory Evaluation,
in spite of its age, was found still viable. The information obtained from the original study of inflatable lifejackets
has not changed significantly in light of a comparable two and a half year investigation conducted by the Boat/U.S.
Foundation for Boating Safety completed in March 1993. The annual number of casualties and drownings involving recreational
boating accidents has not changed significantly since these figures were gathered. Further, the Coast Guard is proposing
to improve the limited performance of devices already approved under the current regulations by requiring new Type
I, II, or III hybrid devices to have increased inherent buoyancy. This Regulatory Evaluation is available in the docket
for inspection or copying at the location indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
addresses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation provides an explanation of the estimated costs of these proposed regulations. There will no increase
in costs to any sector under these proposed changes since hybrid PFD's are only being approved as an option to existing
approved devices. The total approval costs per design are expected to be approximately $12,000 for hybrid inflatable
PFD's. Costs to approve other types of PFD's are approximately $6,000. The additional cost to approve hybrid PFD's
could easily be absorbed in the cost of the units produced. The cost increase per device would be small considering
the number of devices produced under authorization of each approval certificate. The Coast Guard anticipates that,
within the first year after issuing the final rules, one or two designs will be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production inspection costs imposed by these regulations will be approximately $1,000 for the largest size lot of
inflatable lifejackets permitted. This cost is similar to that incurred for other types of approved PFD's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The retail cost, per device, is expected to be $80&hyph;$200 for hybrid PFD's. Currently approved PFD's range in price
from $7&hyph;$200. Type I devices that could be replaced by hybrid PFD's have an average cost of about $40.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations provide an alternative to users for whom limited stowage space or other operational considerations
make the carriage of conventional inherently buoyant PFD's impractical or inadvisable. For these users, the optional
carriage of hybrid PFD's will meet their specific operational needs and will therefore justify the higher cost relative
to inherently buoyant PFD's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations will have little or no effect on federal, state, or local governments except in their capacities
as consumers of PFD's. Coast Guard steps to implement these proposed changes will be done within the scope of ongoing
marine safety activities, and there will be no need for additional federal budget commitments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information in the evaluation this proposal, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. If you feel that your business qualifies as a small entity and would suffer
significant, negative economic impact, please submit a comment explaining why your business qualifies as a small
entity and to what degree the proposed regulations would economically affect your business. Cost data submitted
will be thoroughly evaluated before publication of the final rule.

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each
proposed rule which contains a collection of information requirement to determine whether the practical value of
the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection of information requirements include reporting,
recordkeeping, notification, and other similar requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal requires separate PFD manuals for each hybrid PFD Type which may increase paperwork burdens. However,
the Coast Guard has determined that this additional load will be balanced be decreasing the frequency of currently
approved collection of information requirements. The current requirements will be reduced by decreasing the number
of required inspections and tests.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking revises established safety
standards for hybrid inflatable personal flotation devices (PFD). The authority to regulate concerning PFD's is
committed to the Coast Guard by statute. Furthermore, since PFD's are manufactured and used in the national marketplace,
safety standards for PFD's should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, if
this rule becomes final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt State action addressing the same subject matter.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. These
proposed rules are expected to have no significant effect on the environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination
statement has been prepared and has been placed in the rulemaking docket.

Type I_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face
down position to a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore, greatly increasing one's chances of survival.
The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, especially for cruising on waters where there is a probability of delayed
rescue, such as large bodies of water where it is not likely that a significant number of boats will be in close proximity.
This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. It is reversible and available in only two sizes_Adult
(over 40 kg (90lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb)) which are universal sizes (designed for all persons in the appropriate
category).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly backward position in the water. The turning action is not
as pronounced as with a Type I and the device will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type I. The
Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I. This Type PFD is normally sized for ease of emergency
donning and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90
lb)), and two categories of Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb). Additionally, some models
are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to use the Type II where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where
it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing and other water activities.

Type III_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Type III PFD allows the wearer to assume a back of vertical position, and the device will maintain the wearer in that
position and have no tendency to turn the wearer face down. It is not designed to turn the wearer face up. A Type III is
generally more comfortable than a Type II, comes in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual use,
and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, hunting, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This Type
PFD normally comes in many chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are available. You may also
prefer to use the Type III where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons
to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities.

Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A Type I, II, or III Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has a minimal amount of buoyancy
when deflated and significantly increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual buoyancy for
your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label.
This type of PFD provides an extra degree of comfort to the boater who will accept the responsibility for care of the
device and in-water trials to check its performance. The buoyancy provided by this PFD when not inflated will not float
approximately 90 percent of the boating public. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with
enough inflation to float the wearer. It is suitable for use where there is or is not a probability of quick rescue depending
on the performance type marked on it. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming, while Types II and
III are good only when there is a chance of fast rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for
persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23&hyph;40 kg (50&hyph;90); and small child, for
persons weighing 14&hyph;23 kg (30&hyph;50 lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I hybrids
but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult
and youth sizes but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.''

A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who has fallen overbroad and is intended to be grasped and held by
the person until rescued. While the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in certain instances, this type
is suitable only where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be
engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children.

Type V Hybrid_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has a minimum deflated buoyancy and
significantly more buoyancy when inflated. In order for the device to be acceptable for use on recreational boats,
it must be worn except when the boat is not underway or when the user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer similar
to the action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of performance is indicated on the label). This type of PFD
provides an extra degree of comfort to the boater who will wear a PFD by having a reducd amount of inherent buoyancy.
However, the user must accept the responsibility for care of the device and in-water trials to check its performance.
The buoyancy provided by this PFD when it is not inflated will float approximately 70 percent of the boating public.
Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough inflation to float the wearer. It is suitable
for use where there is or is not a probability of quick rescue depending on the performance type marked on it. This type
of PFD is approved in two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); and youth, for persons weighing 23&hyph;40
kg (50&hyph;90 lb), and may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.

The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, especially for cruising on waters where there is a probability of delayed
rescue, such as large bodies of water where it is not likely that a significant number of boats will be in close proximity.
This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. It is reversible and available in only two sizes_Adult
(over 40 kg (90 lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb.)) which are universal sizes (designed to for all persons in the
appropriate category).

This PFD has limited inherent buoyancy which means YOU MAY HAVE TO INFLATE IT TO FLOAT, and the inflatable portion requires
maintenance. In the event of an accident or fall overboard, the chance of any PFD aiding in your survival are greatly
increased if it is worn. Wearing this PFD makes its limitation much less significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is only one way to find out if you will float without inflation. That is to try this PFD in the water as explained
in [insert reference to the section of the manual that discusses how to test the PFD]. If you have not tested this device
in accordance with these guidelines, the Coast Guard does not recommend it use.

Why Do You Need a PFD?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A PFD provides buoyancy to help keep your head above water and to help you stay face up. The average in-water-weight
of an adult is only about 5 to 10 pounds. The buoyancy provided by most PFDs will support that weight in water. However,
the hybrid Type I, II, or III PFD may be an exception. The uninflated buoyancy provided by this PFD may only float 90 percent
of the boating public. This is because the inherent buoyancy has been reduced to make it more comfortable to wear. So,
you may not float adequately without inflating the device. Once the device is inflated you will have a minimum of 22
lb of buoyancy for adult sizes, which is more than enough to float everyone. (See table above [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
below
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
] for the actual minimum buoyancy for different Types of hybrids.) Your body weight alone does not determine your in-water-weight.
Since there is no simple method of determining your weight in water, you should try the device in the water in both it's
deflated and inflated condition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Your PFD won't help you if you don't have it on. It is well-known that most boating accidents occur on calm water during
a clear sunny day. It is also true that in approximately 80 percent of all boating accident fatalities, the victim did
not use a PFD. Don't wait until it's too late. Non-swimmers and children especially should wear their PFD at all times
when on or near the water. Hybrid Type I, II, III or V PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless inflated enough
to float the wearer.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on Incoming Publications in order to
require that inmates in medium security, high security, and administrative institutions may receive softcover
publications only from the publisher, book club, or bookstore. Current regulations allow for these items to be received
from any source. The proposed amendment also allows for the Warden to make an exception to this requirement and to the
existing similar requirement for hardcover publications and newspapers. This change is being proposed in order
to simplify security procedures designed to prevent the introduction of contraband into Bureau institutions. Provisions
in the Bureau's regulations on Inmate Legal Activities which restate the Bureau's policy on receipt of incoming publications
would be modified accordingly as a conforming amendment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on Incoming Publications. A final rule on this subject
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38260) and was amended December 7, 1982 (47 FR 55129) and January 3, 1985 (50 FR 410). A conforming
amendment would be made to the Bureau's regulations on Inmate Legal Activities. A final rule on this subject was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38263) and was amended December 4, 1981 (46 FR 59509) and July 23, 1990 (55 FR 29992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations in 28 CFR 540.71 allow an inmate to receive paperback books and magazines from any source. This
proposed amendment would require that at medium security, high security, and administrative institutions all softcover
publications may be received only from the publisher, book club, or book store. This would simplify Bureau procedures
designed to prevent the introduction of contraband into Bureau institutions and would allow for more efficient use
of Bureau staff and resources. In addition, this amendment would allow the Warden to make an exception when a publication
is no longer available from the publisher, book club, or bookstore. In such cases, the Warden may require that the inmate
provide written documentation that the publication is no longer available from these sources. The approval or disapproval
of any request is to be documented in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau regulations on Inmate Legal Activities restate in &sect;543.11(d) the policy on receipt of incoming publications.
As a conforming amendment, &sect;543.11(d) is also revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12886,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing
to the Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during the
comment period will be considered before final action is taken. All comments received remain on file for public inspection
at the above address. The proposed rule may be changed in light of the comments received. No oral hearings are contemplated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations for Institutional Eligibility under the Higher Education Act of
1965, as amended (HEA), and the regulations for Eligibility of Foreign Medical Schools under the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program (GSLP) to reflect changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The Secretary proposes
to remove the latter regulations from title 34 of the Code of Regulations, revise them, and add them to the former regulations,
as a new subpart E. The proposed regulations would revise the procedures and criteria under which a foreign institution
establishes eligibility to apply to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs if the institution
is comparable to an eligible institution of higher education located in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Institutional Eligibility regulations contain requirements that apply to all postsecondary educational institutions
that seek initial or continued eligibility to apply to participate in the programs authorized by the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Negotiated Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 492 of the HEA contains procedural requirements that the Secretary is to follow in developing proposed regulations
required for changes made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325) to parts B, G, and H of title
IV of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 492(a) required the Secretary to convene regional meetings to gain public input on the content of proposed
regulations. Participants at those meetings were to include individuals and representatives of the groups involved
in the student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the HEA, such as students, legal assistance
organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies. During
the meetings, the Secretary was to provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning
the implementation of the amendments made by Public Law 102&hyph;325 to parts B, G, and H, and was to take information
received at the meetings into account in the development of proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the regional meetings, the Secretary was to draft and submit regulations implementing the amendments
made to parts B, G, and H to a negotiated rulemaking process. Participants in the negotiations process were to be chosen
by the Secretary from individuals nominated by groups participating in the regional meetings and were to reflect
the diversity and sizes of organizations providing financial aid services to both local areas and national markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with these requirements, the Secretary convened four regional meetings to discuss issues raised by
the 1992 Amendments to the Higher Education Act, including the eligibility of foreign institutions to apply to participate
in the FFEL programs. The primary issues considered in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings were: the general criteria needed for the Secretary to determine the eligibility of institutions outside
the United States, how the Secretary should determine whether a foreign institution is comparable to an eligible
institution of higher education in the United States, and the appropriate method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating examination ``pass rates'' of students or graduates of foreign graduate medical schools. (These pass
rates are among a number of statutory requirements for determining the eligibility of foreign graduate medical schools.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings were held in New York, New York; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri,
during the month of September 1992. Participants in the meetings were invited to nominate individuals to serve as
negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking into account views expressed at the regional meetings, the Department prepared draft proposed regulations
on the 1992 Amendments. The draft regulations were negotiated during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The negotiators
reached general agreement on the content of the draft regulations relating to the eligibility of foreign institutions
to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the significant changes made by these proposed regulations to current regulations follows.

Proposed &sect;600.51 (current &sect;601.1) Purpose and scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to revise the purpose and scope of proposed subpart E to remove the provisions that exempt from
these regulations medical schools in Canada or other foreign countries, if those schools are accredited by a nationally
recognized accrediting agency that accredits medical schools in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. This change is necessary because of the statutory change to section 481 of the HEA that requires every foreign
institution to be subject to all of the applicable criteria for determining the eligibility of foreign institutions.
Accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting agency is still among the criteria in proposed &sect;600.55(a)(4)(ii)
for a public or private nonprofit foreign medical school to be eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs
(see the discussion under that section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.52 (current &sect;601.2) Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would define a foreign institution as one that is not located in a State, and would revise the definition
of a foreign graduate medical school to require medical schools in Canada to be subject to proposed subpart E of 34 CFR
part 600. These changes reflect statutory changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also would define a secondary school as one that provides secondary education under the laws of the country
in which the school is located. This definition is needed for purposes of establishing compliance with criteria in
&sect;600.54 governing a foreign institution's admission policies and level of educational program offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.53 (current &sect;601.3) Requesting an eligibility determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to require a foreign institution to provide, release, or authorize the release to the Secretary
of the information that would be required in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart. The failure to provide that information would render the institution ineligible to participate in the FFEL
programs. These provisions restate the statutory requirement in section 481(a)(2)(C) of the HEA. With regard to
the provision of performance data that would be required in &sect;600.55 on examinations administered by the Educational
Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), the ECFMG initially informed the Secretary that it would study
the issue. Subsequently, the ECFMG indicated that it is unwilling to furnish this data directly to the Secretary.
Consequently, the Secretary proposes to require applicant institutions to furnish the data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the Secretary to comply with the statutory mandate to consider the pass rates on those exams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to require a foreign institution seeking initial or continued eligibility to apply for
a determination of that eligibility on a form prescribed by the Secretary, rather than permitting a student to apply
on behalf of the institution, as is currently the case. This change is necessary because of the statutory change requiring
an institution to furnish applicable information. However, a student would still be able to inform the Secretary
of his or her desire to seek an FFEL program loan for attendance at a foreign institution. The Secretary would then contact
the institution and supply the institution with application forms.

Proposed &sect;600.54 Criteria for determining whether a foreign institution is eligible to apply to participate
in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would contain the criteria that the Secretary would use to determine whether a foreign institution is
eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. To be eligible, a foreign institution would have to admit as
regular students only persons who have a credential for completion of secondary school or the recognized equivalent
of that credential. The institution would have to be legally authorized to provide a postsecondary educational program.
The institution would have to provide an eligible educational program that leads to a legally authorized degree equivalent
to an associate, bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree awarded in the United States, would have to be at least
a two-academic-year program acceptable for full credit toward the equivalent of a bachelor's degree awarded in the
United States, or would have to be equivalent to at least a one-academic-year training program in the United States
that leads to a certificate, degree, or other recognized educational credential and prepares students for gainful
employment in a recognized occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the criteria of this section would be parallel to those required of institutions of higher education, the
Secretary proposes to adopt the criteria for purposes of determining that a foreign institution is comparable to
an institution of higher education in the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed &sect;600.55 (current &sect;601.4) Additional criteria for determining whether a foreign graduate medical
school is eligible to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the criteria in current &sect;601.4 a requirement for a foreign graduate medical
school to employ as faculty members only those with academic credentials equivalent to credentials required of faculty
members teaching the same or similar courses in the United States. The Secretary considers this requirement necessary
for determining the comparability of foreign graduate medical schools to medical schools in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to replace the current requirement in &sect;601.4(e) concerning the pass rate of students
and graduates of foreign graduate medical schools on ECFMG examinations with new requirements. The new requirements
are mandated by the changes to section 481(a)(2) of the HEA. Under those statutory changes, for the year preceding
the year in which any of a foreign graduate medical school's students seeks a loan under the FFEL programs, generally
at least 60 percent of the school's enrolled students and 60 percent of its graduates must have been neither citizens
nor nationals of the United States nor eligible noncitizens for purposes of the title IV, HEA programs. Further, for
the year preceding the year in which any of the school's students seeks a loan under the FFEL programs, generally at
least 60 percent of the school's students or graduates taking ECFMG examinations must have received a passing score
on those examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, in implementing these requirements, proposes several clarifications to ensure the statistical
accuracy and uniformity of a foreign graduate medical school's calculations. For purposes of the calculation concerning
the citizenship of the school's students and graduates, the school would count only those enrolled students who are
full-time regular students. The Secretary believes that it is necessary to restrict this calculation to full-time
regular students to prevent institutions from enrolling a significant number of part-time students who are not seeking
a degree or certificate in order to obtain the required percentage. The school would count as graduates only those
from its most recent graduating class during the academic year preceding the year for which the calculation is performed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the calculation concerning the pass rate of the school's students and graduates, the school would
count all enrolled students, regardless of their enrollment status or their regular student status. The Secretary
believes that it is appropriate to count all enrolled students or graduates in the pass rate calculations in order
to obtain a larger sample, thereby ensuring statistical accuracy and validity. A second reason to include all enrolled
students in the pass rate calculation is that the statute requires the Secretary to consider the pass rate on the examinations
administered by the ECFMG as a measure of comparability to medical schools located in the United States. Performance
on the examinations administered by the ECFMG reflects both the quality of the education at the foreign medical school
and the knowledge of the individual student who takes the examination. Thus, it is appropriate to include the scores
of all students in this calculation to fully reflect the comparability of the institution and its students and graduates
to medical schools located in the United States. The Secretary also notes that the statute did not expressly exclude
any students from calculation of the pass rate. The school would count as graduates those persons who graduated from
the school during the three years preceding the year for which the calculation is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ECFMG examinations are administered separately in two steps: Step 1 includes basic medical sciences and Step
2 includes the clinical sciences. A person may take each step in different years. In addition, the ECFMG administers
an English test for purposes of satisfying the requirement for demonstrating English language competency to obtain
ECFMG certification. Therefore, the Secretary would require the school's calculation for any year to include any
student or graduate who took any step of the ECFMG examinations, including the English test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 481(a)(2) of the HEA exempts from both of the above calculations a foreign graduate medical school whose clinical
program has been approved by a State as of January 1, 1992. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would include this exemption, but would further require the school's clinical program to maintain current
State approval. The Secretary believes that this additional requirement is necessary to establish that a school
that does not meet the applicable minimum percentages at least has a clinical program comparable to one provided by
an eligible institution of higher education in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also would require a foreign graduate medical school to be accredited by an accrediting body legally
authorized to evaluate the quality of graduate medical school educational programs and facilities in the school's
country. The accreditation standards used by that accrediting body would have to be evaluated by an advisory panel
of medical experts appointed by the Secretary and that panel would have to determine if those standards are comparable
to those used for accrediting medical schools in the United States. A public or nonprofit school that is not accredited
would have to be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency designated by the Secretary. (Currently,
the Secretary recognizes the Liaison Committee on Medical Education for the accreditation of programs leading to
the M.D. degree.) These accreditation requirements are mandated by the changes to section 481(a)(2) of the HEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to provide for the expiration of a foreign institution's eligibility after four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, unless the Secretary specifies a shorter period of eligibility. Currently, a foreign institution's eligibility
generally expires after two years. The Secretary proposes this change to allow for treatment of foreign institutions
consistent with that for institutions in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to provide for the continued eligibility of a foreign graduate medical school to be contingent
upon the school's annual submission of the information in &sect;600.55 concerning the school's enrollment and pass
rate on ECFMG examinations. Currently, a foreign graduate medical school's eligibility is not terminated solely
because of a failure to maintain the specified pass rate. The Secretary proposes to make this change to conform to changes
made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to provide for the continued eligibility of an otherwise eligible student for loans under
the FFEL programs for up to an academic year after the academic year in which a foreign institution loses eligibility,
if the student received an FFEL program loan for attendance at the institution while the institution was eligible.
This change would merely reflect statutory changes made by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small entities affected by these regulations are small foreign institutions. However, the regulations would
not have a significant economic impact on the small institutions affected because the regulations would not impose

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations affect businesses or other for-profit entities and nonprofit institutions that participate
in the FFEL programs. The Secretary needs to collect this information to enable the Secretary to enforce the statutory
provisions for determining the eligibility of foreign institutions to apply to participate in the FFEL programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the academic year in which that institution lost its eligibility, if the student actually received an FFEL program
loan for attendance at the institution for a period during which the institution was eligible under this subpart E.
