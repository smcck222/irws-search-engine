Section 13301 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, 26 U.S.C. 1391&hyph;1393,
established the Rural Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program. Under this program, the Secretary of Agriculture
is authorized to designate up to 3 Empowerment Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities in rural areas. This document
authorizes the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development and the Administrator of the Rural Development
Administration to carry out that program.

This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rule making
and opportunity for comment are not required, and this rule is effective January 18, 1994. Further, since this rule
relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order Nos. 12866 and 12778. This
action is not a rule as defined by Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the
provisions of that Act. This rule also is exempt from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, as
amended (42 U.S.C. Chapter 35).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking implements provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act. The Act amends the
timeframe for household election of a repayment method for intentional Program violation (IPV) claims, changes
retention rates on food stamp recipient claims for State agencies and reduces the enhanced funding rate for the costs
of planning, designing, developing and installing ADP and information retrieval systems. This rule also implements
a provision of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991, relating to household election
of repayment method for inadvertent household error (IHE) claims. This rule also implements a change to ADP requirements
which limits enhanced funding requests for automated systems to initial development of a ``complete'' system and
corrects errors made in previously published regulations relating to recipient claims and enhanced ADP funding.
In addition, this rule clarifies exceptions to requirements to provide notice of adverse action when an allotment
is reduced to recoup a recipient claim and clarifies the Federal funding rate allowed for preparation of a Planning
Advance Planning Document (PAPD). Finally, this rule gives State agencies, at their request, the option to make payment
by check for FNS&hyph;209 amounts due FNS, and to have payments due from FNS to the State made by check in place of amending
the States' letter of credit.

Section 13961 of the Omnibus Budget reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), (Public Law 103&hyph;66), Signed August 10,
1993, reduces the federal reimbursement rate for development of automated data processing and information retrieval
systems development to the standard 50 percent Federal reimbursement level effective April 1, 1994. During the last
week of October 1993 and the first week of November 1993, the Department issued a memorandum which briefed States on
the details of this change in the law. The memorandum will be followed by conforming regulations which will be effective
April 1, 1994.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive
effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which
would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified
in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule
or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted.

94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). George Braley, Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified
that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will
affect recipients who must elect a repayment method for IPV claims. State and local agencies which administer the
Food Stamp Program will be affected by the change in retention rates on food stamp recipient claims and the reduction
in the enhanced funding rate for development of ADP system.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 10, 1991, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 46127) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed changes to Food Stamp Program recipient claims
and ADP funding requirements as required by the Mickey Le Lano Memorial Hunger Relief Act, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, (hereinafter
``Pub. L. 101&hyph;624''). The Department received 21 comment letters which addressed provisions of the proposed
rule. FNS has given careful consideration to all comments received. The major concerns of the commenters are discussed
below.

Repayment Decision Timeframe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have shortened the time for participating households to choose how they would repay inadvertent
household error (IHE) and intentional Program violation (IPV) claims in order to forestall involuntary reduction
of their allotments. The timeframe for such elections would have been shortened from 30 days to the day of receipt of
the demand letter for repayment unless the adverse action period for the claim had not elapsed or the household had
timely requested a fair hearing and continued benefits. Public Law 101&hyph;624 mandates the shortened timeframe
for IPV claims. The proposed rule would have also applied this timeframe to IHE claims. The preamble to the proposed
rule should be consulted for the complete discussion of the background of this decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received 13 comments on this part of the proposed rule, 10 from State agencies, one from the welfare department of
a large city, and two from public interest groups. Five State agencies supported the proposal; most other commenters
objected to it, primarily because it applied the shortened timeframe to IHE claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that since the statute spoke only to IPV claims, applying the ``same day'' decision timeframe
to IHE claims was against the law. Several commenters objected to the proposal on the grounds that the shortened decision
timeframe for IHE claims would cause hardship on households, especially those in rural areas, and was in any event
too short to allow adequate time for due process. Two commenters objected to our statement that the proposal would
enhance conformity with Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) rules on claims management. Several commenters
stated that if it were established for either IHE or IPV claims, the ``same day'' standard would impose significant
operational problems on State agencies, and that a 10-day minimum should be adopted for both types of claims. One of
the operational difficulties cited was the need to track responses due at varying intervals because of the consideration
of such circumstances as geography. One commenter believed that the proposed rule required a fair hearing on IPV claims
in addition to an administrative disqualification hearing or comparable action establishing such claims.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In section 911 of Public Law 102&hyph;237, which was signed December 13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991, Congress resolved this issue by providing that for an IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim, ``the household shall be given notice permitting it to elect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another means of repayment [other than allotment reduction] and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given 10 days to make such an election before the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commences action to reduce the household's monthly allotment.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department understands by this language that no action to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's monthly allotment may be taken by the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the eleventh day following the household's receipt of notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the IHE claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically households first receive notice about IHE claims through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mail in demand letters. Consequently, there is no practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way to determine exactly when households receive such notices and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in turn, the eleventh day afterwards. There is also the problem of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing for return mail time. This rule provides that within 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of the date of the demand letter, households must notify State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies of their choice of repayment method or be deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elected allotment reduction. This timeframe should allow for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly required 10-day decision timeframe and adequate mail time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five days for delivery to households and five days for household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return mail to State agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, the provision is restated to deal with IHE and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPV claims separately and to clarify that the timeframe for the IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim repayment decision relates both to initial demand letters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to demand letters following fair hearings which sustain IHE claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, to take account of demand letters which may be handed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household, the language makes clear that the 20-day period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins on the date the demand letter is mailed or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered to the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to the effect that the claim itself was the adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, not the collection action. (This statement was made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with exempting the initiation of allotment reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the adverse notice requirements when households have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided notice about appeal rights on the underlying claim. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal is discussed later in this preamble.) The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would like to clarify this matter. Current rules require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households be provided specific information about their rights to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal recipient claims. Once this information is provided, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair hearing is requested and a determination to sustain the claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made, the household's remaining decision is how it will pay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim. Making that decision should take relatively little time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify how this policy applies to IHE claims, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that in cases of IHE claims, if a fair hearing sustains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim, the household must notify the State agency of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election of repayment method within 20 days of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the hearing decision or be deemed to have elected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allotment reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to IPV claims, the final rule provides that households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must elect a method of repayment on the date of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter required by 7 CFR 273.16(e)(9), 7 CFR 273.16(f)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (g)(3) of current rules (or if the date of receipt is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business day, on the next business day) or be deemed to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elected allotment reduction. The final rule requires that for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPV claim, the first claim demand letter following an action which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes the claim, inform the household about this timeframe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for election of a method of repayment and the consequence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failing to meet it. This is intended to clarify that the timeframe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for electing a repayment option begins with the demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also provides that each State agency must, for IPV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, determine a deadline for the return of completed election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms in order to determine if the election is timely. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department does not expect State agencies to set such deadlines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case by case. State agencies should establish uniform timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for responses to demands for repayment of IPV claims, if necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing for situations such as mail time to and from remote areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule states that the deadline cannot exceed 10 days from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date that the demand letter is mailed or otherwise delivered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable households. The time period is set at a maximum of 10 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the law requires a ``same day'' decision from households and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a relatively short response time is appropriate to that statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these changes, to accommodate the different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for IHE and IPV claims relating to repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions, the final rule treats IHE and IPV claims in separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections. Furthermore, since recoupment is a method of collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is used only for participating households, when appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule refers to ``participating households.'' In 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.18(d)(4), which contains the policies on repayment decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframes, the heading is changed to ``Further collection actions'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since that more accurately describes the material in the paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, because IHE and IPV claims are treated in separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subparagraphs, the first sentence of paragraph (4)(i) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule has been deleted to eliminate potential confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This deletion also eliminates the redundant phrase ``do not respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely or fail to respond.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was concerned that a significant number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believed that in reducing the time for electing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment for IHE claims the proposed rule would also have abridged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to appeal the claim. Consequently, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating IHE and IPV claims separately, the final rule sets forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the content of the initial demand letter for IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims separately from the content of a demand letter for IHE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims which are sustained by fair hearings. An initial IHE demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter needs to inform the household that it has an option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely electing a repayment method
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
requesting a fair hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A demand letter provided after a hearing decision which sustains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim would not offer the hearing option. Similarly, the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter for an IPV claim can only be issued following an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative disqualification hearing or other action which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes an IPV claim. The rule adds a phrase to clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to other comments, the final rule makes several other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes with respect to the required content of the demand letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for IHE and IPV claims. One commenter recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed list of repayment methods in 7 CFR 273.18(d)(3)(iii) be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded to include repayment in coupons. However, a full list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment methods is already contained in 7 CFR 273.18(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of that section already requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter inform the household of these methods of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in addition to being incomplete, the proposed list in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d)(3)(iii) is redundant, and so the final rule deletes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter pointed out that we do not require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand letter inform households when recoupment would begin and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of benefits the household would then receive. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that it would be useful to include this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the demand letter. Current rules at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.18(g)(4) require that prior to reduction State agencies inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households about the effect of recoupment on their benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the final rule provides that, unless the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has otherwise informed the household what its allotment would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net of the reduction for repaying the claim, it provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the demand letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current rules at 7 CFR 273.12(c)(2) provide that decreases in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits must be made effective no later than the month following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lapse of the adverse notice period. Consistent with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general policy and the required timeframe for election of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment method, the final rule provides that the initial demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter for IHE claims must inform the household that the reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will begin with the first allotment issued after the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either timely elects allotment reduction or, if it fails to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely election, with the first allotment issued after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the time for its election. Demand letters provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent to a fair hearing sustaining an IHE claim must inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household that if it fails to make a timely election, allotment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction will begin with the first allotment issued after timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of such election is due to the State agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter on this paragraph recommended that we be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific about the acceptable ways for households to communicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their decisions about repayment. The Department is not aware of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any operational difficulties with how State agencies and households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently communicate about claims collections. Current rules at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.15(h) provide that requests for fair hearings may be oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in writing so long as they are clear and if they are not, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may ask households for clarification. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourages State agencies to apply this standard to communications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning elections of repayment methods. Consequently, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule does not specify ways households must communicate elections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about repayment methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have amended 7 CFR 273.13(b) which lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions from notices of adverse action. As mentioned earlier in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this preamble, the proposed rule would have added situations where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State agency initiates allotment reduction against a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been provided notice of its appeal rights for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying claim to the list of exemptions. No commenter objected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this action or indicated the need for clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the final rule adopts the language as proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.13(b)(14). Several commenters did remark about an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated statement in the preamble which was that the claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself was the adverse action, not the collection action. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that the changes in this final rule clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that statement. Households are due notice of specific appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights regarding claims such as how the claim arose, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on which the claim is based, how the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim was calculated and the right to contest the claim. Once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those due process requirements have been met and the claim has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established, State agencies are expected to proceed to collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities without additional notices of adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Technical Corrections to Current Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department used the proposed rule to correct two errors in 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 273.18(d)(3) of current rules which resulted from the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration-Management rule published February 22, 1990 (55 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6233). The first correction clarified that a notice of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is required when a claim is not established in a fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. It deleted the phrase which limited this requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those circumstances where ``the amount of the claim'' had not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established. The one comment received on this matter was from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency which indicated it was already in compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broader requirement. Consequently, the final rule adopts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language as stated in the proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second correction reinstated a provision in 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.18(d)(4)(iii) allowing other methods of collecting claims for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IHE and State agency error claims. A commenter objected on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds that the law does not authorize other collection methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for IHE claims. However, section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2022(b)(2)(B)) does authorize such collection action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for IHE claims. Accordingly, the final rule adopts the language as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in the proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
State Agency Retention of Claims Against Households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have reduced the recipient claims retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for State agencies from 50 percent to 25 percent for IPV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims and from 25 percent to 10 percent for IHE claims. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule further specified that the new rates are effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the period beginning October 1, 1990 and ending September 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995. Beginning October 1, 1995 the old rates of 50 percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IPV claims and 25 percent for IHE claims will again take effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also would have allowed State agencies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to submit a one-time request for any additional amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due under the old, higher retention rates by November 30, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four comments were received on this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the proposed rule, the Department had previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed State agencies to implement the new retention rates for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and payment purposes. This was done in order to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Act and to minimize the need for revised reporting on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form FNS&hyph;209, Status of Claims Against Households. Effective with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first quarter Fiscal Year 1991 FNS&hyph;209 report, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been recovering funds from State agencies at the new retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates in accordance with the Act. The Department had also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously advised State agencies of the procedure for requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any additional retention due on collections received prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1990 and the deadline for filing such requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State and one local agency felt that the retention rates should be restored to their former levels. The commenters
indicated that the higher retention rates in effect prior to October 1, 1990 were a significant incentive for States
to pursue the collection of Food Stamp Program claims and felt that the new lower retention rates could result in a loss
of State or local support for collection and fraud control activity. The local agency stated that it used the money
to help administer the fraud control program and that the cutback would hamper the county's effort to locate and prosecute
food stamp fraud. The new retention rates were mandated in the Act and do not involve Departmental discretion. Since
the retention rates are mandated by law, the final regulation retains the new retention rates as specified in the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two State agencies commented on the procedure in the proposed rule of claiming only the new retention rates on the FNS&hyph;209
and filing an adjustment request for any additional retention amount due the State agency. The proposed rule provided
that a one-time request to claim the higher rates for transactions occurring on or after October 1, 1990 but involving
collections received prior to October 1, 1990, may be filed with the Department after Fiscal Year 1991 but no later
than November 30, 1991. One State agency believed that States should be given the option of using the old, higher retention
rates on the FNS&hyph;209 if they can identify those collections, or the lower retention rates if it is in the State's
best interest. The commenter felt that States should not be burdened with requesting and justifying higher retention
rates in a special request if their systems are able to identify those collections that qualify. Another State agency
recommended that there be no time limitation to filing a request and that States should continue to receive the higher
retention amount due under the higher rates in effect prior to October 1, 1990 if all other conditions are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not adopting the suggestion to allow State agencies to claim higher retention rates for collections
received prior to October 1990 on the FNS&hyph;209 rather than requiring submission of an adjustment request. The
FNS&hyph;209 and the FNS automated system which supports State reporting are structured to recognize one retention
percentage for each type of claim. Edit checks are designed to detect mathematical errors and inadvertent under-
or over-retention for each claims category prior to the Department accepting the report. Instead of redesigning
the FNS&hyph;209 and the automated system, the Department is permitting State agencies to claim for the additional
retention by submitting an adjustment request after the end of the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also not adopting the suggestion to eliminate the time limitation for filing a request for retention
adjustment, but has decided to allow State agencies an additional year to claim any additional retention. The proposed
rule allowed a one-time request for retention adjustment and specified a deadline of November 30, 1991 for filing
the request. In October 1992, the Department advised State agencies that it would allow a second round of adjustment
requests after Fiscal Year 1992 which must be filed no later than November 30, 1992. Accordingly, the final rule allows
State agencies to submit a first time request (if they have not previously done so), or second request for additional
retention which must be filed no later than November 30, 1992. The Department believes the additional year should
be sufficient time for any adjustments, transfers, and refunds of collections received in Fiscal Year 1990 or earlier
to be adjusted and claimed by State agencies at the old, higher retention rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also using this opportunity to update the reference in the proposed rule concerning amending the
States' letter of credit for FNS&hyph;209 payments to reflect current practice. The proposed rule restated current
policy in that it provided that FNS would collect amounts due FNS or pay State agencies by amending the States' letter
of credit. Although in most cases the State agency owes FNS for FNS' share of collections, FNS may owe the State agency
in situations where the retention amount due the State agency exceeds the cash collection. This occurs when the State
agency experiences a preponderance of non-cash rather than cash collections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR 273.18 and 276.2 previously provided that FNS would collect amounts due FNS for recipient
claims collections and title IV reimbursements and pay State agencies by offsetting or amending the States' letter
of credit. However, in order to accommodate State and Federal financial management requirements, FNS has accepted
FNS&hyph;209 payments by check from a number of State agencies and has sent checks to State agencies which were owed
money. The Department believes it is appropriate to change the current language to provide for checks when requested
by State agencies rather than require a number of State agencies to conform to the letter of credit procedure. In the
final rule the Department is allowing State agencies to request that FNS accept checks from the State for FNS&hyph;209
amounts due FNS, or that FNS pay the State by check for FNS&hyph;209 amounts due the State. If such a request has not been
or is not made, payment to the State agency and collection from the State agency will be made through the letter of credit.
The Department reserves the right to offset any amount due FNS by letter of credit offset if payment is not made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also amends similar provisions relating to title IV reimbursements in 7 CFR 276.2 and letter of credit
offsets in 7 CFR 277.16 to conform with this change. Title IV reimbursements are reported as a separate line item on
the FNS&hyph;209 and are used along with claims collection data in the calculation of the total amount due FNS from
the FNS&hyph;209. Thus, a change in the method of collection or payment of the total amount due from the FNS&hyph;209
would also apply to the line items that make up the total figure. The change in the general authority for letter of credit
offset in 7 CFR 277.16 is a consolidation of the authority for organization purposes. As noted above, the regulations
in 7 CFR 273.18 and 276.2 previously allowed FNS to offset from the letter of credit for FNS&hyph;209 payments due FNS.

Automated Data Processing (ADP) Enhanced Funding Rate Reduction to 63 Percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule stated that section 1752(a) of Public Law 101&hyph;624, enacted on November 28, 1990, changed the
enhanced funding rate for ADP and information retrieval system development from 75 percent to 63 percent effective
October 1, 1991. The proposed rule also stated that pursuant to section 1752(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;624 this change
in the funding rate does not apply to proposals approved prior to the enactment date of November 28, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received which stated that this reduction is unreasonable at a time when automation efforts need
to be increased to keep pace with growing caseloads and decreasing resources. One other commenter stated that this
reduction was unfair to those States that had never requested enhanced funding because they had not previously had
the necessary resources available for development purposes and that were now in the process of pursuing such development.
The reduction in the enhanced funding rate was mandated by law and does not allow Departmental discretion. Since the
retention rate is mandated by law, the final regulation retains the 63 percent rate as specified in the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested clarification of whether approval of the planning advance planning document (PAPD) prior
to November 28, 1990, constituted total project approval at the enhanced funding rate. The Department believes that
the purpose of the PAPD is to determine whether the developing system would be a viable one and whether continued system
development is appropriate. Therefore, approval for funding a PAPD is separate from later funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was also made aware of concerns about the approval of funding proposals after November 28, 1990 that
were submitted prior to that date. Specifically, there was a concern that States which had submitted complete implementation
advance planning documents (IAPD) prior to November 28, 1990, but did not receive approval by FNS until after that
date were being unfairly penalized. The Department reviewed the legislation in light of this concern and has made
a change in 7 CFR 277.4(b)(12) of the final rule. This section now provides that a State will receive 75 percent enhanced
funding for automated system development, if prior to November 28, 1990, the State had both an approved (PAPD) and
had submitted an IAPD along with all the paperwork required for approval. However, modifications to approved IAPDs
and any increase in costs which occur after September 30, 1991 (during system development), will be funded at the 63
percent level. Other than this modification, 7 CFR 274.4(b)(12) is adopted as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
One-time Enhanced Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine comments were received on the proposed one-time enhanced funding provision which provided that all requests
for more than one-time enhanced funding for automated system development in a particular State be denied. These comments
focused on the rapid pace of changes in technology and the need for federal enhanced funding to allow States to incorporate
these changes into a system once the initial system development has been completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the proposed rule, a 1988 audit issued by the General Accounting Office (GAO) interpreted the original
legislation differently than the Department. According to GAO, the funding scheme was initially designed so that
enhanced funding for automation should only be available for a State's first attempt at automation development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FNS recognizes the concern expressed by commenters to keep pace with the rapid change in computer technology. However,
the legislative history accompanying Public Law 96&hyph;249, The Food Stamp Amendments of 1980, specifically addressed
the funding of upgrading or modification of a system originally funded at the enhanced level. In the House Report the
Committee stated that the 75 percent rate for cost sharing was intended to be one-time and funds were to be strictly
limited to initial development. H.R. Rep. No. 96&hyph;788, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. 112&hyph;113 (1980). Ongoing system
utilization or upgrading expenses would be shared at the 50 percent level applicable to most other administrative
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the House Report and the General Accounting Office (GAO) audit cited in the proposed rule, the Department
has decided that enhanced funding should not be available for system changes to an already existing system which was
initially developed with enhanced funding. Accordingly, with some technical corrections described later, the
proposed &sect;277.18(g)(1) is adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also wants to clarify that it will fund one ``complete'' system development effort at the enhanced
level one time, if the system meets all applicable standards. A ``complete'' system contains both certification
and issuance components that meet existing standards. For example, a State may receive enhanced funding for the development
of a certification component of a system which meets all of the applicable functional standards. The State may then
also receive enhanced funding for a subsequent project to ``upgrade'' the system by adding an issuance component
which also meets all of the applicable functional standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States are currently given the opportunity to pay back the difference between regular and enhanced funding for a partial
system (i.e. certification component only) and then move forward to develop a ``complete'' new system. As of (insert
effective date of final rule), States will no longer be given the opportunity to pay back this difference. The Department
will fund to ``complete'' system development but will not permit paybacks that allow the State to replace at enhanced
levels a component already funded at the enhanced level which is no longer useful in the new system design. For example,
a State has received enhanced funding for a certification component and completes component development. At a later
date, the State re-evaluates automation activity and a decision is made to automate the issuance function, and to
redo the certification component. In this situation, the Department may allow enhanced funding for the issuance
component but will not allow funding at the enhanced level for a new certification component. Finally, if a ``complete''
system was funded at the enhanced level, a replacement system is not eligible for enhanced funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will reimburse States at the enhanced level, if appropriate, for ``planning efforts'' that did not
lead to implementation of a system. The purpose of the planning effort is to ensure that the ultimate system development
effort is a viable one. Therefore, a State may qualify a second time for enhanced funding for planning if the previous
planning effort was not successful. However, a State will not be eligible for enhanced funding for the actual implementation
efforts for the second time if the initial implementation effort failed to develop a ``complete'' system that meets
all applicable standards. Paybacks by States for failed implementation attempts will no longer be approved as of
(insert the effective date of the final rule).

Federal Funding for Preparation of the Planning Advance Planning Document (PAPD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed rule provided clarification that the 50 percent rate of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) would
be allowed for State administrative expense incurred during preparation of the PAPD. Two commenters felt that the
preparation of a PAPD should be funded at the enhanced rate since the preparation took more time than suggested in the
regulations and resulted in a document more extensive than 6&hyph;10 pages. One commenter suggested that a clear
description of specific costs eligible for enhanced funding would help to adequately differentiate between preparation
of the PAPD and the actual planning phase activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is maintaining the requirement that the preparation of the PAPD by States be funded at the regular FFP
rate of 50 percent. The PAPD is intended to be a brief written plan of action which describes the State agency's intended
activities and proposed budget for planning phase activities as well as an estimate of the total project costs. At
a minimum, the State agency is required to include information set forth in 7 CFR 277.18(d) in the PAPD submission.
Planning phase activities will be reimbursed at the enhanced rate only if the PAPD was approved at that rate. Planning
phase activities that are eligible for reimbursement at the enhanced funding rate are identified in 7 CFR 277.18(g)
of these regulations. In addition, the Department would like to clarify language in paragraph 277.18(g)(8)(iv)
of that section which may have contributed to the confusion surrounding the level of FFP allowed for the preparation
of a PAPD. The second sentence in this paragraph has been changed to read as follows: ``The cost of planning activities
which were approved for enhanced funding under a Planning APD may be funded at the 63 percent level regardless of final
approval or denial of the Implementation APD''.

Miscellaneous Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the Department had failed to provide recipient protections in ADP systems through the proposed
rule and requested that the Department republish the rule to include provisions for this concept. Through this rule
the Department is addressing only the automation funding provision of the Public Law 101&hyph;624. Public Law 101&hyph;624
also contains provisions concerning standards for automated systems that include concerns about recipient protection.
However, this rule does not implement those provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is primarily interested in the use of automated systems to provide more timely and accurate benefits
to recipients as well as more program and system accountability and the APD process, the Department is emphasizing
recipient protection when a system is under development as well as when the system is operational. Notices, expedited
service and processing procedures are being emphasized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested clarification regarding whether ``development'' of an automated system includes transfer
and modification of an existing State system in an enhanced funding situation. The Department believes that current
regulations at &sect;&sect;272.10(a)(3) and 277.18(d)(2)(ii) adequately address the requirement that a State,
as part of the development of its automated system, assess whether the transfer or modification of an existing State
system is cost effective. Transfer or modification may be reimbursed at either the regular or enhanced funding levels
according to the criteria discussed above.

An additional change is contained in these final provisions in order to correct language in 7 CFR 277.4 and 277.18 of
current regulations. There is a typographical error in 7 CFR 277.4(b) (11) and (12), 277.18(b), under the definitions
for enhanced funding or enhanced FFP and regular funding or regular FFP, and in 7 CFR 277.18(g)(1) and 277.18(g)(3).
The word ``or'' appearing after the word ``development'' and before the word installation in these sections has been
changed to ``and''.

The provisions of this action relating to household election of repayment method for IPV claims at 7 CFR 273.18 are
effective retroactive to November 28, 1990, when Public Law 101&hyph;624 was enacted. The provisions at 7 CFR 273.18
relating to household election of repayment method for IHE claims is effective December 13, 1991, the date of enactment
of Public Law 102&hyph;237. The provisions at 7 CFR 273.18 which reduce State agency retention rates on claim collections
applies, by its terms, to the period beginning October 1, 1990 and ending September 30, 1995. Therefore, the new retention
rates are effective retroactively to October 1, 1990. The provision at 7 CFR 277.18 which reduces the enhanced funding
level for ADP is effective retroactively to October 1, 1991 for costs incurred on that date and thereafter and does
not apply to ADP plans approved prior to November 28, 1990. The corrections to the Administration Management final
rule, the correction to the reference to enhanced ADP funding, the change to FNS&hyph;209 methods of payment and the
amendments relating to one-time enhanced funding and to Federal funding for preparation of Planning APD's are effective
30 days following the date of publication of this final rule.

The following retention rates shall

apply for claims collected by the State agency, including the value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of allotment reductions for the purpose of collecting claims but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not allotment reductions due to disqualification: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For amounts collected prior to October 1, 1990, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency shall retain 25 percent of the value of inadvertent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household error claims collected and 50 percent of the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intentional Program violation claims collected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For amounts collected during the period October 1, 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through September 30, 1995, the State agency shall retain 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the value of inadvertent household error claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected and 25 percent of the value of intentional Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation claims collected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For amounts collected on or after October 1, 1995, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency shall retain 25 percent of the value of inadvertent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household error claims collected and 50 percent of the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intentional Program Violation claims collected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The State agency shall not retain any percentage of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of administrative error claims collected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The State agency shall retain the value of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected for inadvertent household error, intentional Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation, or administrative error claims rather than forwarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the payments to FNS. This amount includes the total value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allotment reductions to collect claims, but does not include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of benefits not issued as a result of a household member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being disqualified. The State's grant and letter of credit will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established or amended on a quarterly basis to reflect the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's retention of the value of claims collected as specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (h) of this section unless the State agency requests or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has requested that payment be by check. The State agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request that FNS accept checks from the State for FNS&hyph;209 amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due FNS, or that FNS pay the State by check for FNS&hyph;209 amounts due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State. If the State agency fails to pay FNS the amount due as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported on the FNS&hyph;209, FNS shall offset the amount due from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's letter of credit. For FNS&hyph;209 reporting purposes, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies shall calculate the retention amount using the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate specified in paragraph (h) of this section which is in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the reporting period for the report. For those claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected in Fiscal Year 1990 or earlier for which adjustments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made and reported in Fiscal Year 1991 or 1992, States may request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a correction to reflect the difference between the old, higher rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(paragraph (h)(1) of this section) which is applicable to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, and the new, lower rate (paragraph (h)(2) of this section) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at which the adjustments to those claims were reported on the FNS&hyph;209. One request for correction for each of
fiscal years 1991 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 may be filed with FNS after the fiscal year, but no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1991 for Fiscal Year 1991 reporting and no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1992 for Fiscal Year 1992 reporting. The request must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in writing, must include appropriate verifying documentation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and must reflect the net effect of all increases and decreases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the application of the old retention rate.

FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, reviewed the safety of the additive and the chemical impurities
that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself has not
been shown to cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amounts of unreacted ethyl acrylate, a carcinogenic
reactant used in the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as ethyl
acrylate, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives.

I. Determination of Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A), the so-called
``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the data available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21
CFR 170.3(i)) define ``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientist that the substance
is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticancer or Delaney clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides that no food additive shall be
deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause
applies to the additive itself and not to impurities in the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been
shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general
safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from the proposed use of the additive.

)-trione will result in exposure to the additive of no greater than 100 parts per billion (ppb) in the daily diet (Ref.
1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,
the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies, subchronic studies, and teratological
studies on the additive. No adverse effects were reported in these studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and
using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by ethyl acrylate, a carcinogenic
chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation of the carcinogenic impurity ethyl
acrylate has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive; and
(2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.

A. Ethyl Acrylate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using risk assessment procedures, FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to ethyl acrylate from
the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture of polyester elastomers and rubber articles for repeated use
and currently regulated uses to be 380 parts per quadrillion of the daily diet (3 kilograms), or 1 nanogram (ng) per
person per day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from the National Toxicology Program report (No. 259: 1986), a bioassay
on ethyl acrylate, to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming
from the proposed use of the additive and the level of ethyl acrylate that may be present in the additive (Ref. 3). The
results of the bioassay on ethyl acrylate demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for rats and mice under
the conditions of the study. The test material induced squamous cell neoplasms in both sexes of F344/N rats and B6C3F

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the potential exposure of 1 ng per person per day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime
risk from the use of the 3,5-di-

, or 8.1 in 100 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, the actual lifetime
averaged individual exposure to ethyl acrylate is expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake,
and therefore the calculated upper-bound limit of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm from exposure to ethyl acrylate would result from the proposed use of 3,5-di-

The agency has also considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of ethyl acrylate impurity
in the food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because
of the low level at which ethyl acrylate may be expected to remain as an impurity following production of the additive,
the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; and (2)
the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity, even under worst-case assumptions, is very
low, less than 8.1 in 100 billion.

C. Conclusion on Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the additive
in polyester elastomers in contact with dry food and rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food
is safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical
effect. Therefore, &sect;178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.

III. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

IV. Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before February 18, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objection thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objection received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 OMB Circular A&hyph;133 establishes audit requirements and defines Federal responsibilities for implementing
and monitoring such requirements for institutions of higher education and other nonprofit institutions receiving
Federal awards. It supersedes Attachment F, subparagraph 2h, of Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative
Requirements for Grants and other Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit
Organizations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of Circular A&hyph;133 apply to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal departments and agencies responsible for administering programs that involve grants, cost-type contracts
and other agreements with institutions of higher education and other nonprofit recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions whether they are recipients receiving awards
directly from Federal agencies, or are subrecipients receiving awards indirectly through other recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 27, 1992, the Department published an interim rule at 57 FR 33252 to adopt the provisions of the circular. The
rule adopted the provisions of Circular A&hyph;133 by adding to Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, a new PART
45_NON-FEDERAL AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND OTHER NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. Part
45 incorporates the requirements set forth in Circular A&hyph;133. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also made numerous technical changes throughout the parts of Title 24 in order to make the cross-referencing
and conforming changes necessary for implementation of Circular A&hyph;133. Included in these technical changes
were a number of changes needed as a result of the definition of ``Federal financial assistance,'' as set forth in the
circular. That definition now covers loans, loan guarantees, and insurance. Therefore, programs that make, guarantee,
or insure loans to nonprofit mortgagors have been brought within the coverage of Circular A&hyph;133, as it is implemented
at part 45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for HUD programs whose regulations are set forth in 24 CFR parts 207, 213, 221, 232, 236, 242, 277, 880, 881,
883, 884, 885, 886, 889, and 890, a nonprofit institution is the nonprofit corporation which owns the individual property
receiving the HUD assistance. Each project under the parts 200 series and many projects under the parts 800 series
are required to complete project-specific audits because they are deemed to be separate entities. The audits currently
conducted under applicable HUD audit guides for these programs will serve as the organization-wide audits required
by OMB Circular A&hyph;133 and this part. In performing the compliance review required by paragraph 13.c. of OMB Circular
A&hyph;133, auditors should consider the compliance requirements set forth in the OMB Compliance Supplement. In
accordance with the regulatory agreement incident to the insured mortgage, where HUD provides federal funding,
the audit reports pertaining to nonprofit organizations subject to these regulations are to be submitted within
60 days after the end of the fiscal year audited. Each of the parts listed in the first sentence of this paragraph is amended
to cross-reference to part 45. The details of coverage of entities receiving assistance under these parts is contained
in section 45.1(c).

Parts 889 and 890 are programs regarding supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities, respectively.
The regulations for these programs were developed after the publication of the interim rule. Nonetheless, the projects
under these programs are required to complete project-specific audits because they are deemed to be separate entities.

The public was given 60 days in which to submit comments to the interim rule published on July 27, 1992, at 57 FR 33252,
and comments were received from three commenters: One nonprofit organization, one certified public accounting
firm, and one national association of certified public accountants. Below is a listing of the issues raised by the
commenters and the Department's response and resolution of those issues.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for a compliance audit performed by an independent accountant seem to be redundant, time-consuming,
and costly, especially where municipal and county requirements include monthly financial and compliance reports,
and both municipal and county officials perform inspection of the records, programs and procedures. Nonprofit organizations
that are subrecipients should be allowed to continue adherence to the guidelines in Circular A&hyph;110. [one nonprofit
organization and one certified public accounting firm]

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accommodation of this comment is not feasible. OMB issued Circular A&hyph;133 to supersede portions of Circular
A&hyph;110 and clearly included, under the A&hyph;133 coverage, funds received as a subrecipient. The Department
is implementing the provisions of the circular and has no flexibility in this matter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule should be effective for years beginning on or after August 26, 1992, the effective date stated for the rule.
However, the revisions to paragraph 45.1(d) state that the requirements are applicable to fiscal years beginning
on or after January 1, 1990. An effective date of January 1, 1990 requires institutions to retroactively apply OMB
Circular A&hyph;133, creating an undue hardship on those institutions and their auditors. [one national association
of certified public accountants]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The date in the summary of the interim rule (August 26, 1992) relates to when the audit is conducted, and the date in section
45.1 (fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1990) relates to the period audited. Circular A&hyph;133 specifies
that audits of periods beginning on or after January 1, 1990 will be covered. The Department is merely implementing
OMB policy.

as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;133 (including hospitals that are not affiliated with an institution of higher
education) *&blank;*&blank;*.'' However, section 1.k. of the Attachment to Circular A&hyph;133 excludes hospitals

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substitution of Circular A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions,
for Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment F, subparagraph 2h (which covered grants to universities, hospitals, and other
nonprofit organizations) left open the issue of coverage of hospitals. The explanation for this omission, advanced
by OMB, was that most hospitals receive reimbursement from the federally funded Medicaid and Medicare programs,
each of which has its own statutory audit requirements. Albeit hospitals which are affiliated with universities
are covered by Circular A&hyph;133 by reason of that affiliation and non-university affiliated hospitals, which
receive federal funds pursuant to research contracts, are subject to contract closing audits, there still remained
a policy decision of coverage of non-university affiliated hospitals that may be receiving HUD assistance. Therefore,
under section 45.1(b) of the interim rule, the coverage was continued under Circular A&hyph;133 for non-university
affiliated hospitals that receive HUD assistance. The decision to extend coverage to this group of hospitals receiving
HUD assistance was made as a matter of policy. Any hospital receiving Federal funds should, as a matter of sound fiscal
management, receive audit reviews of the use of those funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule makes final the interim rule that is discussed above. The following four programs are added to its coverage
by this final rule, since the regulations for these programs were developed after the publication of the interim rule:
PART 92_HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM, PART 572_HOPE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES PROGRAM (HOPE
3), PART 889_SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY, and PART 890_SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.
As discussed earlier in this preamble, the projects under parts 889 and 890 are required to complete project-specific
audits.

This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning
and Review, issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made in the rule subsequent to its submission
to OMB are identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the Office of the Rules Docket

The content of this rule does not constitute a development, nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building
sites, but relates only to auditing and fiscal functions. Thus, the authorities and standards of &sect;50.4 of 24
CFR part 50 (the regulations implementing Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969) are
inapplicable to this rule; therefore, it is categorically excluded from the NEPA requirements pursuant to &sect;50.20(k).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing its decision to approve a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Colorado program), under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment consists of changes to provisions of Colorado's rules concerning backfilling and grading for the elimination
of highwalls, and limited variances from approximate original contour (AOC) requirements. The amendment is intended
to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations and to improve operational
efficiency.

On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program for the regulation
of coal exploration and coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed
explanation of the conditions of approval can be found in the December 15, 1980,

II. Submission of Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated March 19, 1993, Colorado submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to the rules of the Colorado Mined Land
Reclamation Board (Board) at 2 Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR) 407&hyph;2 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;536).
Colorado submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its March 19, 1993, amendment, Colorado proposed to revise 2 CCR 407&hyph;2, Rule 4.14.1(2), performance standards
for underground mining operations and remining operations; Rule 4.14.2, modifications by the Colorado Division
of Minerals and Geology (Division) to the general backfilling and grading requirements for steep-slope, underground,
and remining operations; and Rule 4.27.4, variances from AOC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1993 (58 FR 19367), announcing receipt of the proposed amendment to the Colorado program and inviting
public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO&hyph;541). The public comment period was scheduled
to end May 14, 1993. However, in response to a request for an extension of the public comment period, OSM published a
notice in the May 12, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 27967) extending the public comment period until May 29, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;545).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns with Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g), regarding the need for
a written demonstration that all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill a highwall;
Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g), regarding the need to define the term ``reasonably available spoil''; Rules 4.14.1(2)
(f)(iii) and (g)(iii), regarding the need to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority that a highwall
remnant is stable; and Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)(i), regarding the need to require that all reasonably available spoil within
the permit area be used to eliminate a highwall. OSM notified Colorado of these concerns by letter dated July 8, 1993
(administrative record No. CO&hyph;553).

Colorado responded in a letter dated August 4, 1993, by submitting additional explanatory information and a revised
amendment (administrative record No. CO&hyph;559). Specifically, Colorado proposed additional revisions to
(1) Rule 1.04 (103a) to include a definition of the term ``reasonably available spoil''; (2) Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding
a demonstration by the applicant in writing that an existing highwall was in place prior to August 3, 1977, and that
the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall and face-up area
so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3; (3) Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)(i), regarding the requirement that all reasonably available
spoil in the permit area be used to backfill a highwall; (4) Rules 4.14.1(2)(f)(iii) and (g)(iii), regarding the requirement
that the operator demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Division that a highwall remnant is stable; and (5) Rule 4.14.1(2)(g),
regarding the allowance for incomplete highwall elimination for remaining operations that contain a preexisting
highwall where the operator demonstrates in writing to the Division that the volume of all reasonably available spoil
is insufficient to completely backfill a reaffected or enlarged highwall so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the revised amendment in the August 30, 1993,

a public hearing on the adequacy of the amendment considering the additional materials submitted (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;570). The comment period closed on September 14, 1993.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds
that the proposed amendment, as submitted by Colorado on March 19, 1993, and as revised by it on August 4, 1993, is no
less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.

1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Colorado's Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado's proposed revisions to the following previously-approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature and consist
of minor editorial, punctuation, and codification changes. Corresponding Federal provisions, if any exist, are
listed in parentheses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.14.1(2)(h) (30 CFR 816.102(d) and 817.102(d)), placement of spoil on the area outside the mined-out area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.14.2(1)(a) (30 CFR 816.102(b) and 817.102(b)), general slope grading requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 4.27.4 (30 CFR 816.102(a)(1) and (2), 817.102(a)(1) and (2), 816.133(d) and 817.133(d)), limited variances
from AOC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved Colorado rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director
finds that these proposed Colorado regulations are not inconsistent with SMCRA and are no less effective than the
Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At newly-created Rule 1.04(103a), Colorado proposed to define the term ``reasonably available spoil'' that would
apply to backfilling and grading operations and highwall elimination on continuously mined areas (Rule 4.14.1(2)(f),
finding No. 3) and on remaining operations on previously mined areas (Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), finding No. 4). Colorado
proposed to define ``reasonably available spoil'' to mean ``spoil and suitable coal mine waste material generated
by a remaining operation, or other spoil or suitable coal mine waste material located in the permit area that is accessible
and available for use and that when rehandled will not cause a hazard to public safety or significant damage to the environment.''
Colorado's proposed definition is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal definition of the term
``reasonably available spoil'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rule 1.04(103a)
defining the term ``reasonably available spoil'' is no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition
of ``reasonably available spoil'' at 30 CFR 701.5. The Director approves the proposed rule.

3. Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), Exception From the Requirement for Complete Highwall Elimination for Continuously Mined
Areas at Underground Mining Operations

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to recodify existing Rule 4.14.1(2)(f) as 4.14.1(2)(h) and add a new Rule 4.14.1(2)(f). At Rule
4.14.1(2)(f), Colorado proposed requirements for underground mining operations that have highwalls or face-up
areas that were in place prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and have continued to operate in the same
location after that date. In this rule Colorado proposed an exception from the requirement for complete elimination
of face-up areas and highwalls for underground mining operations of an applicant demonstrates in writing to the Division
that the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall and face-up
area so as to achieve a safety factor of 1.3. Such face-up areas and highwalls would have to be eliminated to the maximum
extent technically practical. Furthermore, Colorado proposed at Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v) that (1) all
reasonably available spoil in the permit area shall be used to backfill the highwall and that reasonably available
spoil in the vicinity of the operation shall be included in the permit area, (2) the backfill shall be graded to a slope
that is compatible with the approved postmining land use and that provides adequate drainage and meets a minimum static
safety factor of 1.3, (3) the highwall remnant shall be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the public health
and safety or to the environment and the operator shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the
highwall is stable, (4) exposed coal seams, toxic and acid-forming materials, and combustible materials shall be
adequately covered or treated in accordance with Rule 4.14.3, and (5) spoil placed on the outslope during mining operations
that occurred prior to August 3, 1977, shall not be disturbed if such disturbance will cause instability of the remaining
spoil or otherwise increase the hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal backfilling and grading regulations at 30 CFR 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) allow an exception from the
requirement for complete highwall elimination for underground mining operations that remine highwalls in ``previously
mined areas,'' which by definition are those that existed prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and
are not subject to the standards of SMCRA. These regulations allow for the incomplete elimination of such highwalls
where the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged
highwall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's proposed rules differ from the Federal regulations in that Colorado proposed to extend the exception
for incomplete highwall elimination to underground mining operations where highwalls or face-up areas were in place
prior to August 3, 1977, the effective date of SMCRA, and have continued to operate in the same location after that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director has approved similar proposed regulations for Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah (52 FR 49398, 49399,
December 31, 1987; 56 FR 21304, 21330&hyph;21331, May 23, 1990; 58 FR 48600, 48603, September 17, 1993). Colorado's
proposed rules and Kentucky's, West Virginia's and Utah's approved regulations address the situation of operators
attempting to reclaim face-up entry areas that are created prior to the passage of SMCRA. Many of these underground
mines have been in existence for many years and the earthen material necessary to eliminate the face-up entry is either
no longer available or has been completely revegetated and its handling and use would cause new environmental damage
and disruption. This problem is unique to underground mines where highwall areas do not move with the coal removal
operations (as with surface mines) but exist in a static state for many years. The problem is not encountered in surface
mines where post-SMCRA operations are continually creating new highwalls rather than extracting coal from pre-SMCRA
highwall areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In passing SMCRA, Congress addressed the surface impacts of underground mining and surface extraction of coal in
a generally similar manner, but it did provide for important differences. In section 516 of SMCRA, Congress affirmatively
established certain performance standards applicable to underground mines and incorporated by reference other
performance standards at section 515. One of the performance standards incorporated by reference, section 515(b)(3),
requires highwall elimination. However, section 516(b)(10) also requires that the Secretary shall make such modifications
in the requirements imposed by this subparagraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct difference between
surface and underground coal mining.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah provisions, the Director exercised his authority as the Secretary's designee
to consider these distinct differences between surface and underground mines and approved them. The Director reasoned
that the provisions provided equitable treatment for pre-SMCRA mines that have operated continuously since before
the effective date of SMCRA. They also afforded the same variance from AOC requirements as is provided in 30 CFR 817.106
for remining sites where operation of a pre-SMCRA mine has been interrupted and mining was begun again at the sites
after the
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; effective date of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons discussed above for the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah proposed regulations, the Director
finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v) are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) or any other requirements of the Federal regulations or SMCRA, insofar as they
apply to underground mining operations that operated prior to August 3, 1977, and have continuously operated since
that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director wishes to emphasize that any exception to SMCRA's requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls,
including the exception for continuously mined areas, must be construed and implemented in a carefully limited manner
and should ensure that the highwall is removed to the maximum extent technically practical (48 FR 41720, 41729, September
16, 1983). Thus, for example, where an underground mining operation has been continuously mined since before the
effective date of SMCRA (August 3, 1977) and contains both pre- and post-SMCRA face-up or portal areas, this exception
must be understood as applying only to the pre-SMCRA face-up areas. Any post-SMCRA portal areas within the same mining
operation must comply with the requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado has confirmed that the exception proposed at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f) would apply only to those face-up areas or
highwalls that were created prior to August 3, 1977, and that any face-up area or highwall initially formed after August
3, 1977, at an underground mining operation would be subject to the requirements for complete highwall elimination
under the approved Colorado program (administrative record No. CO&hyph;538).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Director approves Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) (i) through (v).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to add Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), which allows for an exception to the requirement for complete highway
elimination at remining operations initiated after August 3, 1977, on sites that were mined and abandoned prior to
August 3, 1977, and contain a preexisting highwall, when the operator demonstrates in writing to the Division that
the volume of all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the reaffected or enlarged highwall
so as to achieve a static safety factor of 1.3. In such instances, the highwall must be eliminated to the maximum extent
technically practical and must comply with criteria proposed at Rules 4.14.1(2)(g) (i) through (v), which are addressed
in finding No. 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado's proposed rules are substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b)
(1) through (4), 817.106(b) (1) through (4), 816.102 (a)(3) and (f), and 817.102(a)(3) and (f). For this reason, the
Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(g) (i) through (v) are no less effective than the counterpart
Federal regulations and approves them.

 Existing Colorado Rule 4.14.1(2)(a), which has been previously approved by OSM, provides that the AOC of an area disturbed
by surface mining must be restored ``[e]xcept as specifically exempted in these Rules.'' Colorado proposed to eliminate
the general phrase ``[i]n these Rules'' and replace it with specific references to all of the provisions of the Colorado
program that provide exemptions from the requirement to restore AOC. The referenced exemptions include proposed
Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) and 4.14.1(2)(g) and existing Rules 2.06.5, 4.14.1(2)(e), and 4.27.4.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), which has no counterpart in the Federal regulations, provides a limited exemption from
the requirement to restore AOC when the operation is an underground mining operation that contains a highwall or face-up
area that was in place prior to August 3, 1977. For the reasons discussed in finding No. III.3., this exemption is no
less effective than the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed rule 4.14.1(2)(g) provides an exemption from the requirement to restore AOC for remining operations initiated
on sites that contain a preexisting highwall. For the reasons discussed in finding No. III.4., this exemption is no
less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(3) and (f), 817.102(a)(3) and (f),
816.106(b) (1) through (4), and 817.106(b) (1) through (4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Rules 2.06.5 and 4.27.4, which were previously approved by OSM, provide an exemption from the requirement
to restore AOC in steep-slope mining situations. This exemption is no less effective than the counterpart Federal
regulation exemptions at 30 CFR 785.16, 816.102(a) (1) and (2), 817.102(a) (1) and (2), 816.133(d), and 817.133(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) provides that, for an underground mining operation, excess material not required to
eliminate all highwalls and depressions need not be returned to AOC as required by the general grading requirements
at Rule 4.14.2 if the operation demonstrates compliance with the applicable hydrologic balance, topsoil, excess
spoil, and revegetation requirements at Rules 4.05, 4.06, 4.09, and 4.15 and the Division approves this practice.
Rule 4.14.1(2)(e), which was previously approved by OSM, has no direct counterpart in the Federal regulations but
has a general counterpart in the Federal backfilling and grading regulations at 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1). The applicable
part of this regulation requires that disturbed areas for underground mining operations be backfilled and graded
to achieve AOC. Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) provides a specific underground mining exemption to returning or blending excess
material to AOC. The Director interprets this rule to mean that an underground mining operation's disturbed area,
including all highwalls and depressions, must be backfilled and returned to AOC and that any excess material deposited
outside the disturbed area must be blended with the surrounding terrain to achieve AOC. When narrowly interpreted
in this manner to apply to underground mining activities, and not to surface mining activities, and only to excess
spoil material remaining after AOC of the disturbed area has been achieved, Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) is not inconsistent
with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations corresponding to proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) are found at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(1) and 30 CFR
817.102(a)(1). Like the proposed rule, the Federal regulations contain specific references to the portions of the
Federal regulations that provide exemptions to the requirement to restore AOC. Since the proposed revision would
add specificity and clarity to the existing rule, and since each exemption referenced by the proposed revision is
no less effective than the counterpart exemption in the Federal regulations, the Director finds the proposed revision
to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations and approves it.

Colorado's proposed exceptions to the requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Existing Colorado Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) also provides that spoil must be graded to eliminate all highwalls, spoil piles,
and depressions. Colorado proposed to further revise Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) to provide for two exceptions to this requirement.
The first exception provides that spoil need not be graded to eliminate all highwalls if the operation is an underground
mining operation that meets the criteria of Rule 4.14.1(2)(f). The second exception provides that spoil need not
be graded to eliminate all highwalls if the operation is a remining operation on a site mined and abandoned prior to
August 3, 1977, pursuant to Rule 4.14.1(2)(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(2) provide for two exceptions
to the requirement that all highwalls be eliminated. The first exception is for small depressions pursuant to 30 CFR
816.102(h). The second exception is for highwalls in previously mined areas pursuant to 30 CFR 816.102(k)(3)(iii)
and 30 CFR 816.106.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in finding No. III.3., Colorado's first proposed exception, concerning underground mining operations
that contain a highwall or face-up area that was in place prior to August 3, 1977, has no direct Federal counterpart
and is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.106(a), (b), and (b)(1) or any other requirements
of the Federal regulations or SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding No. III. 4., Colorado's second proposed exception, concerning remining operations, is no
less effective than the counterpart Federal exceptions at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed revision would provide for exceptions to the requirements to eliminate all highwalls that have
been determined to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations, the Director approves the proposed
revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.14.2(1) to allow modification of the slope grading requirements at Rule 4.14.2
by referencing existing exceptions to the backfilling and grading requirements at Rule 4.27, regarding performance
standards for variances from AOC restoration requirements for steep-slope mining, and Rule 4.14.1(2)(e), regarding
variances for excess spoil at underground mining operations from AOC requirements if the spoil is not needed to eliminate
highwalls and depressions. In addition, Colorado referenced proposed exceptions to the backfilling and grading
requirements at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding the exception for complete elimination of certain highwalls at underground
mining operations, and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), regarding the exception for complete highwall elimination for remining
of sites mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977. In doing so, Colorado proposed to delete ambiguous language allowing
for modification of the slope grading requirements for lands that had not been restored in accordance with Colorado's
program and where insufficient spoil was available to otherwise comply with Rule 4.14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.14.2(1)(b) to incorporate exceptions to the requirement for complete elimination
of highwalls by referencing proposed Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.27.4(1), regarding variances from the requirements to meet AOC for steep-slope
mining operations, and to incorporate a reference to the proposed highwall elimination variance provisions as set
forth in proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) for underground mining operations and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g) for remining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of these rules proposed by Colorado, the corresponding Federal regulations are found at 30 CFR 816.102(a)
(1) and (2) and 817.102(a) (1) and (2). These Federal regulations require that disturbed areas be backfilled and graded
to achieve AOC, except as provided at 30 CFR 816.102(k) and 817.102(k), concerning variances from AOC for postmining
slopes, and that all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions be eliminated, except as provided at 30 CFR 816.102(h)
and (k)(3)(iii) and 817.102(h) and (k)(3)(iii), concerning small depressions and previously mined areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Colorado's proposed revisions to Rules 4.14.2(1) and (1)(b) and 4.27.4(1) would simply provide for appropriate
references in these rules to other Colorado rules that OSM has previously approved or is approving in this notice,
the Director finds that the proposed revisions are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)
(1) and (2) and 817.102(a) (1) and (2) that identify, by reference to other Federal regulations, the exceptions to
the requirements for AOC and complete elimination of depressions, spoil piles, and highwalls. Therefore, the Director
approves Colorado proposed Rules 4.14.2(1) and (1)(b), and 4.27.4(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter expressed support for and endorsed adoption of Colorado's proposed amendment. The commenter stated
that the amendment allows the Division to make sound scientific reclamation judgments based upon site-specific
conditions and ensures an environmentally sound reclamation configuration. The commenter recognized that the
amendment does not represent a blanket exemption from complete highwall elimination for preexisting operations
but requires applicants to make a specific demonstration in order to qualify for the exemption. Lastly, the commenter
stated that the amendment provides an appropriate balance between the responsibilities of the operator to make an
adequate demonstration, and the Division's responsibility to evaluate each submittal in light of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees with the commenter that the amendment does not provide a ``blanket exemption'' from complete
highwall elimination for preexisting operations (those operations existing prior to August 3, 1977, the date SMCRA
was passed). An operator must use all reasonably available spoil to backfill highwalls that were created before August
3, 1977, and continued to be used thereafter (finding No. III.3.) and to backfill remined highwalls that were initially
mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977 (finding No. III.4.). In either of these situations, if the volume of reasonably
available spoil exists for the operator to completely backfill the highwall, the operator must do so under Colorado's
proposed rules. As the commenter stated, an operator must under Colorado's proposed rules completely backfill the
highwall unless the operator demonstrates that the volume of spoil is insufficient to completely backfill the highwall.
For these and the other reasons discussed in finding Nos. III.3. and 4., the Director is, as requested by the commenter,
approving Colorado's proposed rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, on behalf of several individuals, expressed opposition to Colorado's proposed amendment and requested
that OSM reject it. Specifically, the commenter stated that regulators have caused much of the breakdown in coal enforcement
by cutting ``special deals'' that overlook violations and sidestep rules to accommodate coal operators. The commenter
further stated that Colorado's proposed amendment represents a ``special deal'' for some Colorado operators and
urged OSM to reject it for several reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that the Federal law and rules (30 CFR 817.102) require complete elimination of highwalls at
operating mines and Colorado cannot adopt rules that are less strict than the Federal law and rules (30 U.S.C. 1253
and 30 CFR part 732).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees that section 515(b)(3) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 817.102(a)(2)
require the elimination of all highwalls. However, section 516(b)(10) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary shall
make such modifications in the requirements imposed by this subparagraph as are necessary to accommodate the distinct
difference between surface and underground coal mining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated in finding No. III.3. above, the Director exercised his authority as the Secretary's designee
to consider these distinct differences between surface and underground mines and approved Colorado's proposed
regulations that allow incomplete elimination of highwalls for underground mining operations where the highwall
was created prior to August 3, 1977, but continued to be used thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the rationale of the finding and the substantive similarity of Colorado's proposed regulations to regulations
previously approved in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Utah, the Director does not agree with the commenter's assertion
that Colorado's proposed rules allowing for incomplete elimination of highwalls are less strict than the Federal
law and rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter also stated that ``Congress found highwalls to be one of the most destructive impacts of irresponsible
coal mining'' and that ``[t]hey cause serious erosion and land instability, threaten human and animal safety, and
degrade the beauty and usefulness of public and private lands (E.g., See U.S. Senate Report 95&hyph;128, 1977, p.
51).'' The commenter has mischaracterized Congress' statements in the referenced report. The cited section of this
report does not specifically address highwalls. It states that

[i]f surface mining and reclamation are not done carefully, significant environmental damage can result. In addition,

of coal waste piles, subsidence and mine fires.

While OSM realizes that unreclaimed highwalls left by irresponsible operators could cause such adverse impacts
as identified by the commenter and Congress, OSM does not find that highwalls retained by responsible operators in
accordance with Colorado's proposed rules would cause such adverse impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding Nos. III.3. and III.4. above, Colorado has proposed regulations at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding
incomplete elimination of highwalls for continuously mined areas that are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) and 817.106 (a), (b), and (b)(1) and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), regarding incomplete
elimination of highwalls for remining operations in previously mined areas that are substantively identical to
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b) (1) through (4), 817.106(b) (1) through (4), 816.102(a)(3) and (f),
and 817.102(a)(3) and (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Colorado's proposed regulations and the corresponding Federal regulations include provisions that protect
against erosion and land instability, as well as the threat to human and animal safety. Specifically, Rules 4.14.1(2)(f)
(ii) and (iii) and 4.14.1(2) (ii) and (iii) require that a retained highwall be backfilled and graded to meet a minimum
static safety factor of 1.3 and that a highwall remnant shall be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the
public health and safety or to the environment. In addition, before any highwall remnant is retained, the operator
must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the highwall remnant is stable. The Director believes
that Colorado's proposed rules, which are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations, provide
sufficient safeguards to ensure that highwall stability is achieved and that threat to public health and safety or
to the environment are prevented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that the Division makes the misleading claim that its proposed rules put underground mines on
equitable footing with remining operations. The commenter asserted that, in fact, Colorado's proposed amendment
will significantly reduce the environmental standards for mines that have operated continuously since 1977. The
commenter further stated that the Federal rules allow remining operations to meet lower environmental standards
and leave some highwalls because they are cleaning up abandoned mines that might otherwise not be reclaimed. The commenter
asserted that the Division proposes to treat all existing underground mines as remining sites and deny the public
the protections promised by law and to allow underground mines to escape their obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director does not agree with the commenter's assertions and statements. Colorado's proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)
requires face-up entry areas and highwalls to be eliminated to the maximum extent technically practical using all

apply to both continuously mined areas and remining operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, underground mines can be designated as remining operations only if they qualify for such status in accordance
with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106. Therefore, not every underground mining operation currently
in existence in Colorado is automatically extended the designation of ``remining operations'' on previously mined
areas. Accordingly, unless an underground mining operation began prior to August 3, 1977, and continued operations
into permanent program approval or qualified as a remining operation, the operator is required to completely eliminate
the highwall. As a result, the public is not denied the protections promised by SMCRA, nor are underground mine operations
allowed to escape reclamation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter asserted that Colorado's proposed amendment contains no clear, measurable standards for judging
compliance and success. As an example, the commenter cited the fact that the Division has not clearly defined ``reasonably
available spoil'' and that determining whether an operator has backfilled properly will be left to the judgment of
the operator and the Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director notes that this comment was submitted on May 28, 1993, prior to Colorado's addition on August 4, 1993,
of the definition of ``reasonably available spoil.'' This definition is substantively identical to the corresponding
Federal definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' (finding No. III.2.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM believes the definition of ``reasonably available spoil'' and the Director's clarifications in finding No.
III.2. above include sufficient detail and safeguards to preclude improper implementation of highwall reclamation
rules. If Colorado implements these rules in a manner that is not consistent with the Director's findings, OSM will
address this issue in the oversight of the Colorado program and require Colorado to further modify its rule language
in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17 or take other appropriate actions regarding the implementation and enforcement
of its rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the commenter asserted and alleged that for a number of years, the Division has signed ``settlement agreements''
that allow operators to use lower standards in order to sidestep various performance standards and compliance deadlines.
As an example, the commenter alleged that two recent ``settlement agreements'' were made to allow mines to avoid elimination
of highwalls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that this use of ``settlement agreements'' is unacceptable and represents Division-sanctioned
licenses to violate the law, and that the Division and the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board do not have the legal
authority to set aside the law or create lower standards.The commenter further stated that these agreements and other
Division actions allow operators to continue violations, escape compliance deadlines, meet lower reclamation
standards, and avoid full sanctions for serious violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the commenter requested that, within 60 days, OSM take the necessary steps to (1) revoke the settlement agreements,
(2) achieve compliance at all mines with all rules and deadlines, and (3) prohibit the Division and Board from entering
into similar settlement agreements in the future. The commenter also requested that OSM provide biweekly progress
reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director acknowledges the commenter's assertions and requests. Regarding the request by the commenter that
OSM revoke any settlement agreements entered into by the State of Colorado and an operator, OSM has been notified by
Colorado that it has revoked the two settlement agreements that the commenter is referring to. Regarding the other
requests by the commenter that OSM achieve compliance at all mines with all rules and deadlines, prohibit the Division
and Board from entering into similar settlement agreements in the future, and provide biweekly progress reports,
the Director must also decline to take action on these requests. Any violations of the approved Colorado State program
are subject to enforcement by the State regulatory authority. Should the State fail to enforce its program, OSM, upon
determining that such a failure did, in fact, occur, would use the Federal enforcement mechanisms available to it
to ensure compliance with SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the rationale set forth above in responding to the commenter's concerns and assertions, the Director does
not find Colorado's proposed rules less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director
does not comply with the commenter's request to reject Colorado's proposed amendment pertaining to backfilling
and grading for the elimination of highwalls and limited variances from AOC requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated June 24, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;551), the Mine Safety and Health Administration
(MSHA) responded that the proposed amendment did not appear to conflict with any current MSHA regulations. By a second
letter dated October 15, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;579), MSHA commented that while no direct conflict
between Colorado's proposed changes to its rules and current MSHA regulations can be found, one item may cause future
concern. Specifically, MSHA commented that Colorado's proposal to allow partial reclamation of highwalls means
that any remnant of a highwall remaining after final reclamation creates the potential for misinterpretation to
the extent that a mining company may not consider a [highwall] remnant to be a highwall while MSHA may, in certain situations,
consider a remnant to be a highwall.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees with MSHA that no direct conflict exists with Colorado's proposed amendment. In addition, OSM
refers MSHA to the discussions at finding Nos. III.3. and 4. above, wherein Colorado's proposed Rule 4.14.1(f)(iii),
regarding continuously mined areas, and Rule 4.14.1(g)(iii), regarding remining operations, requires highwall
remnants to be sufficiently stable so as not to pose a hazard to the public health and safety or to the environment. The
operator must also demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Division, that the highwall remnant is stable. Colorado's
proposed rules are substantively identical to the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.106(b)(3) and
817.106(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a mining company may not consider a remnant to be a highwall, the company must, upon approval of this amendment,
comply with Colorado's proposed rules addressing performance standards for highwall remnant stability. Consequently,
the potential for misinterpretation of what constitutes a highwall remnant is minimal. The Director notes that if
MSHA's regulations contain additional performance standards regarding highwall remnants, MSHA is not precluded
from applying them.

V. Director's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves Colorado's program amendment as submitted on March 19, 1993, and
revised on August 4, 1993. As discussed in finding Nos. III.1. through III.5., the Director has determined that Colorado's
proposed regulations addressing backfilling and grading for the elimination of highwalls, and limited variances
from AOC requirements are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director is approving the proposed
rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by
OSM and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 906 codifying decisions concerning the Colorado program are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is an administrative change. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Justice Department
could not require FOIA/PA requesters to provide notarized signatures to prove their identities, finding the policy
clashed with other Federal law. Based on that ruling, the DoD Privacy Office has determined that DOD Component rules
having a similar requirement for notarized signatures must be amended to eliminate the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Office of the Inspector General, DOD, is amending its rules to eliminate the requirement for notarized

Executive Order 12866. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined
that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis
of the rule indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter
the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or
the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

Only upon proper identification will any individual be granted access to records which pertain to him/her. Identification
is required both for accurate record identification and to avoid disclosing records to unauthorized individuals.
Requesters must provide their full name and as much information as possible about the record being sought in order
that a proper search for records can be accomplished. Inclusion of a telephone number for the requester is recommended
to expedite certain matters. Requesters applying in person must provide an identification with photograph, such
as a driver's license, military identification card, building pass, etc.

Clean Air Act Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA or Act) requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or
implement new ones. Carbon monoxide (CO) areas with moderate area designation are required to implement the vehicle
inspection and maintenance program described in section 182(a)(2)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA was also directed to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the
Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. All areas required by the Act to have an I/M program
were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. CO nonattainment areas with design classifications of 12.7 ppm and
below were required to meet EPA guidance for ``basic'' I/M programs. These areas were required to submit a SIP revision
to incorporate a basic I/M program by November 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Oregon a basic I/M program is required in the following urbanized areas: Portland and Medford-Ashland Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Basis for Approval
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes an approval of the committal SIP is appropriate in this case because the state could not be expected to
begin developing an I/M program meeting the requirements of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation
was adopted as a final rule, which occurred on November 5, 1992. EPA does believe that states can adopt revised I/M program
plans within one year of EPA's final rule. Oregon submitted an I/M SIP on November 15, 1993 which contains all of the
elements in the implementation schedule, including authorizing legislation and implementing regulations. The
1993 submittal also included an analysis of the program using the most current EPA mobile source emission model demonstrating
that the program meets the applicable performance standard, among other features.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two
years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective March 21, 1994, unless, by February 18, 1994, notice
is received that adverse or critical comments will be received. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn
before the effective date by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another
will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments
are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective March 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)) (see 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 11, 1993 (58 FR 42711) to exempt natural cedar pesticides, labelled, or for which claims are made, only to
repel arthropods other than ticks, or to retard mildew growth, from regulation under FIFRA. The Agency concludes
that use of these pesticides for these purposes poses negligible risks to human health or the environment and that
the burden imposed by regulation is not justified. Accordingly, EPA is establishing this final exemption. Natural
cedar pesticides labelled with claims of repelling ticks or for which claims are made to repel or otherwise mitigate
ticks, are not included in the exemption. Ticks can be vectors of significant diseases affecting humans, and EPA has
not yet fully evaluated whether or not such an exemption is justified. Thus, regulation of such pesticides is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption will not apply to any cedarwood product that is treated, combined or impregnated with any additional
substances. EPA has determined that natural cedar itself poses little or no risk and does not pose unreasonable adverse
effects on the environment. However, EPA has not made any such finding for cedar when it is mixed with any other ingredients.
Thus, to qualify for this exemption, the pesticide must only contain natural cedar and cannot contain any inert ingredients.
For example, if cedar is painted or soaked in any substance, it would not qualify for the exemption. Likewise, if cedar
chips or shavings are mixed with other ingredients, the exemption would not apply. Natural cedar products, however,
may be packaged and still qualify for the exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Public Comment and Agency Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Agency solicited comments on the proposed exemption from regulation of cedar pesticides
labelled for use to repel arthropods (except ticks) or to retard mildew. Six sets of comments were received. Three
commenters supported the proposed rule and three objected to it. EPA also invited suggestions for additional candidates
for consideration for possible future exemption. Two commenters suggested such candidates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposal included the term ``chips'' to describe the exempted pesticide. American Wood Fibers of Jessup Maryland,
Inc. requested that the word shavings be inserted in the rule in addition to the term chips. Shavings is the term used
more often in the industry. In response to this comment, EPA has added the term ``shavings'' to the final rule. This
is not a significant change since all forms of cedar products (except cedar oil) were intended to be covered by the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Zinc Association and Alltrista Zinc Products Company and Roussel UCLAF Corporation responded to the Agency's
invitation to suggest other low-risk pesticide candidates for exemption from regulation. American Zinc and Alltrista
requested that zinc metal strips used for preventing moss, fungus and mildew on roofs be considered; Roussel UCLAF
Corporation requested review of rotenone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the proposal to this exemption, EPA recognizes that there may be other low-risk pesticides that would also
be appropriate for exemption under section 25(b). EPA is currently evaluating existing pesticide registrations
to identify other potential candidates for exemption or reduced regulation. EPA will include in this consideration
the two pesticides, zinc metal strips and rotenone, that were identified as potential candidates in the comments
submitted on the proposed cedarwood exemption. Moroever, as discussed in the proposed exemption, EPA plans to evaluate
whether or not cedar oil extracted from plant parts is appropriate for exemption. EPA also plans to evaluate in the
future whether or not it is appropriate to exempt cedar products for which claims such as ``repels ticks'' are made.
If EPA determines that any of the above-described exemptions are warranted, EPA will publish a proposed rule on such
exemptions and provide an opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chlorobenzene Producers Association [CPA]; Excell Products Corporation; and Willert Home Products opposed
the cedarwood exemption. Each are, or represent, producers of alternative products for moth repellence which compete
with cedar products. Their objections and the Agency's response to each are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Consumers will be harmed and cedar competitors placed at a disadvantage if natural cedar pesticides are exempted.
CPA and Excell Products assert that a number of competing products to cedar are produced and distributed by small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency disagrees that the proposed exemption of natural cedar will result in harm to consumers. As described in
the proposal, the risk to humans or the environment associated with natural cedar is low. The natural oils in the wood
and other plant parts are present at low levels and little exposure to users or the environment is likely. Cedar products
have been sold and widely used for many years with no known health or environmental effects. EPA's regulatory authority
under FIFRA is primarily a licensing authority; every decision has some potential effect on competitors. The Agency
does not consider potential impact on competitors to be a valid and sufficient reason to preclude this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cedar is ineffective for pest control purposes and cedar companies will be emboldened to make false and misleading
claims without regulatory oversight. Marketing of refresher oils for cedarwood strengthens the impression that
natural cedar is limited or ineffective in pest control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not endorsing the effectiveness of natural cedar as a repellent or for mildew prevention purposes. Because
of the very low risk to man or the environment associated with cedar products, even if the commenters' claims of low
efficacy are true, EPA believes the low risk nature of cedar justifies this exemption. EPA believes the marketplace
is sufficient to suppress ineffective products. The Agency acknowledges that excessive and misleading claims may
be associated with any products exempted from regulation, including cedar products. The Agency does not endorse
or encourage use of excessive or misleading claims for cedar, but believes this is a circumstance where market choices
will restrain abuse and ineffective products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Agency has already assisted the cedar industry with expedited review procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expedited review procedures were employed for several cedar registrations in large part because the Agency considered
these pesticides to pose little or no risk to man or the environment. All supporting data for natural cedar products
were waived except descriptions of processing the wood and analyses for oil content. The Agency concludes that the
low risk associated with natural cedar does not justify the cost of regulation, including the reduced costs associated
with the expedited review procedures cited above, for either society or the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This proposal improperly implies that natural substances are safe and synthetics are hazardous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees that not all natural substances are safe and that not all synthetics are hazardous. Natural cedar,
however, is low-risk for both humans and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The public health risk from exposure to natural cedar may not be negligible; lack of information suggesting risk
does not support a finding of no unreasonable risk. This commenter [CPA] believes the statute requires a finding of
no unreasonable adverse effect on the environment to support the exemption. CPA also concludes that exemption based
on low exposure is inconsistent with prior Agency pesticide policy and that EPA's statutory obligations are not diminished
when a pesticide also has non-pesticidal uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees that lack of information, in and of itself, is not sufficient to justify exemption. In the case of
cedar, however, the point is reinforced from many years of distribution and widespread use of cedar with no known adverse
effect. There is very little exposure likely for humans or the environment to the natural oils. Cedarwood oil typically
occurs in cedarwood at low levels and cannot easily be separated from the wood or plant product. Consumers using cedarwood
products are unlikely to be exposed to significant amounts of dust or oil either by inhalation or through the dermal
route. Moreover, EPA believes that cedarwood oil, when used as it naturally occurs in blocks, chips, or other plant
parts, is not expected to result in any significant environmental exposure and cedarwood oil is not known to persist
or bioaccumulate in the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIFRA section 25(b)(2) authorizes the Administrator to exempt a pesticide if it is determined to be ``of a character
which is unnecessary to be subject to this Act in order to carry out the purposes of this Act.'' Consistent with the comment
from CPA, EPA has determined that cedarwood products, as defined in this rule, pose negligible risks to human health
and the environment and do not pose unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Thus, EPA has concluded that
these products are of a character which is unnecessary to be subject to the Act. As discussed in the proposal of this
rule, the term unreasonable adverse effect is defined at FIFRA section 2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the
environment, taking into account the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.''
EPA believes that natural cedar pesticides pose little or no risk to human health or the environment and that the regulatory
burden imposed by registration of these products is not justified by the negligible risk posed by them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the commenters offered any evidence that would contradict this finding. The only evidence of risk presented
was reference to mechanical injury if a child swallowed a small cedar ball. This comment cited a reference in materials
submitted by a cedar registrant to their product and labelling warning to keep the product away from children. The
Agency agrees that any object small enough to swallow should be kept from small children. If the sole risk posed by cedarwood
products is the risk of children swallowing them, that alone is not a sufficient basis for EPA to regulate them under
FIFRA. FIFRA was designed to address the unique concerns presented by pesticides. EPA does not believe that this type
of physical risk, in the absence of any other pesticidal risk, justifies regulation under FIFRA. Other Federal, State
and local authorities exist that could be used to address this type of risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CPA also commented that EPA is required to find that, to be eligible for exemption under FIFRA section 25(b)(2),
a pesticide product satisfies ``other objectives'' of FIFRA such as meeting statutory criteria for registration
with respect to labeling and composition. In the case of cedar, the Agency concludes that labelling requirements
typically applied to pesticides are not necessary to prevent unreasonable risk to humans, including children (excluding
products with claims involving public health issues). Determinations regarding product composition, labeling
or other aspects of regulatory constraint are unnecessary given the low risk potential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency disagrees with CPA's assertion that consideration of lack of exposure is inconsistent with prior EPA pesticide
policy. The Agency has previously exempted pheromones citing low exposure as one factor in the decision to exempt
[47 FR 33717].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Excell Products Corporation urged that registrations for natural cedar pesticides issued prior to the exemption
not be continued if the exemption is established. They are concerned that this would create a false impression of government
endorsement for the registered articles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not intend to register additional natural cedar pesticides (unless claims for ticks are made _ see
discussions above). It is expected that existing registrations will be voluntarily cancelled after the rule becomes
effective. Registration is never an endorsement of a pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The low risk associated with pesticidal use of natural cedar does not justify the cost of regulation to society or the
Agency. There is no reason to believe that mis-use or disposal of natural cedar pesticides will increase potential
risk. The Agency concludes that use of natural cedar pesticides as described in the proposed regulation will not cause
unreasonable adverse effects on humans or the environment, whether regulated under FIFRA or not. None of the commenters
offered any evidence that would contradict these conclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption will relieve regulatory burdens for those companies and products consistent with the terms and conditions
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with FIFRA section 25, the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) has waived review of the proposed and final
rule. The Secretary of Agriculture waived review of the proposed rule and agreed to waive review of the final rule if
it is the same as the proposed rule. A copy of the final rule was forwarded to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Copies
of the final rule also were forwarded to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee
on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public safety,
or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another Agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354; 94 Stat.1164, 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq.). EPA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small businesses, small governments or small organizations given the impacts forecasted pursuant to the analysis
conducted under Executive Order 12866 as set forth above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this rule does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no information collection requirements. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 is not
applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with FIFRA section 25, the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) has waived review of the proposed and final
rule. A copy of the final rule has been forwarded to the U.S. Department of Agriculture before publication. Copies
of the final rule also were forwarded to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee
on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate.

 In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62071), EPA issued a proposal to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d) to establish an exemption from
the requirement of a tolerance for trimethylolpropane (CAS Reg. No. 77-99-6) when used as an inert ingredient (component
of water-soluble film) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only with a limitation that it will not
exceed 15% of the pesticide formulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted with the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Montana has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Montana's application
and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Montana's hazardous waste program revision satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Montana's hazardous
waste program revisions. Montana's application for program revision is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.

B. Montana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Montana received partial Phase I Interim authorization in February, 1981. Complete Phase I authorization was received
in February, 1982. Final authorization of the base program was received in July, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Montana's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Montana's hazardous waste
program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Montana. The public may submit
written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 18, 1994. Copies of Montana's application for
program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Montana's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to
the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is
received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response
to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft application was submitted on January 7, 1991. The State of Montana addressed all of EPA's concerns prior to
submittal of the final application. Thus, the Montana program is granted immediate final authorization for the provisions
in the following Table.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Montana's program revisions include a requirement that conditionally exempt small quantity generators keep records
of waste analyses for three years (ARM 16.44.402(2)(d)). This provision is broader in scope than the federal requirement
and is not a part of the federally authorized program. Requirements more stringent than those of the federal program
are found in ARM 16.44.402(3) and 16.44.109(19). These provisions require annual, rather than biennial, reporting
for state generators and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. More stringent provisions are a part of the
federally authorized program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Montana's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Montana is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the State of Montana and the Environmental Protection Agency may have potential disagreement as to the scope
of the State's jurisdiction over certain lands within ``Indian Country'', as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, Montana has
not requested authorization of its hazardous waste program, as revised, within ``Indian Country'' in Montana. Accordingly,
today's decision to grant Montana final hazardous waste authorization, as revised, does not extend to ``Indian Country''.
The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to ``Indian
Country'' in Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Montana now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously
approved authorities. Montana also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to
conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to issue orders under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Montana has submitted draft applications for the hazardous waste program provisions in clusters non-HSWA V and VI,
HSWA I and II, and RCRA I and II.

Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Montana's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule identifies a community, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP), that will be suspended on the effective date listed within this rule because of failure to enforce
floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has taken action to bring their floodplain management program into compliance
with NFIP requirements prior to the effective suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn
by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement
measures. The community listed in this document no longer meets that statutory requirement for compliance with program
regulations, 44 CFR part 59 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, the community will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of that date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the community. However, the community may submit the required documentation to bring
its floodplain management program in compliance with the NFIP regulatory standards, after this rule is published
but prior to the actual suspension date. If the documentation is submitted and approved by FEMA, the community will
not be suspended and will continue its eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension
of the community will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, FEMA has identified the special flood hazard areas in the community by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. No direct Federal
financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction or acquisition of buildings in the identified
special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP and identified for more than a year, on FEMA's
initial flood insurance map of the community as having flood-prone areas (Section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes
effective for the communities listed on the date shown in the last column. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This community received a 90-day, and two 30-day notifications addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that the
community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective suspension
date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

unless an appropriate public body adopts and enforces adequate floodplain management measures. The community listed
no longer complies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community
unless it takes remedial action.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice denies a petition submitted by Mr. Robert Crail requesting the agency to reconsider a final rule that added
control line pressure balance requirements to the pneumatic timing requirements applicable to air brake systems.
Mr. Crail's petition was based on his allegations that NHTSA had not adequately considered the added costs to trailer
manufacturers imposed by the rulemaking, including the hardware costs to achieve compliance with the new control
line pressure balance requirements and the costs associated with certifying compliance with those requirements.
In response to this petition, the agency has reexamined the final rule's evaluation of additional costs for this requirement
and again concludes that those additional costs are not excessive or unreasonable. Therefore, Mr. Crail's petition
is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 21, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending the pneumatic timing requirements of Standard No. 121, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Air Brake Systems,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 with respect to the control line pressure balance for tractor trailer combinations (57 FR 37902). In that notice,
the agency adopted a dynamic test procedure for determining the control signal pressure differential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that preceded this final rule, Mr. Crail and the Truck Trailer
Manufacturers Association (TTMA) stated that they believed that measuring control line pressure balance in a dynamic
test instead of in a static test would result in excessive costs. Mr. Crail, who is employed by a trailer manufacturer,
stated that the total cost of a dynamic test would be approximately $6,000, as compared to his estimated cost of $900
for a static test. Similarly, TTMA believed that a dynamic test procedure would require trailer manufacturers to
purchase expensive equipment, such as transducers and recording equipment, costing as much as $6,000. TTMA estimated
that the static test apparatus would cost about $300 per manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding these comments, NHTSA adopted a dynamic test procedure to evaluate control line pressure differential
in the August 1992 final rule. The agency concluded that the static control line pressure differential test advocated
by Mr. Crail and TTMA would not adequately evaluate the pressure differential problem. The agency also determined
that the costs associated with the new dynamic test were reasonable and would be well below the levels estimated by
Mr. Crail and TTMA. The agency explained this determination as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency notes that most trailer manufacturers already own the most expensive portion of this test equipment for
conducting timing tests (i.e., the data recorder/power supply/signal conditioning apparatus), and that the mini-tractor
test rigs that are currently used in compliance testing with Standard No. 121 could be readily upgraded to check for
pressure differentials for an additional cost of $300. Of this cost figure, $100 would cover the hose, gladhands,
and air flow restrictor and $200 would cover the cost of upgrading the software of the test rig. NHTSA notes that the
practical effects of these requirements are limited to only those trailer manufacturers who build towing trailers
(i.e., trailers used in doubles or triples operations). Such towing trailers currently constitute a very small percentage
of the trailer market. 57 FR 37904.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In short, the agency concluded that most trailers would not be subject to the new dynamic test for control line pressure
balance and those that were would face added costs of about $300.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Robert Crail filed the lone petition for reconsideration of this rule. Mr. Crail stated that the agency did not
adequately consider the cost impact that would be imposed on trailer manufacturers to equip trailers with new hardware
necessary to achieve compliance with the new requirements. The petitioner also believed that NHTSA did not adequately
consider the cost impact on manufacturers to obtain or adapt test equipment to test trailers for compliance with the
new requirements. The agency will address each of these assertions in turn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In his petition for reconsideration, Mr. Crail contends that NHTSA seriously underestimated the cost impact per
trailer of adding additional equipment to comply with the final rule. According to Mr. Crail, trailer manufacturers
could comply with Standard 121 prior to this amendment without incorporating a relay booster valve on their trailers.
However, again according to Mr. Crail, the August 1992 final rule in effect requires the use of relay booster valves
on trailers. Mr. Crail estimates that the cost to the trailer manufacturer to add these valves would range from $26
to $54.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that Mr. Crail's initial assertion about a trailer's ability to comply with Standard 121 without incorporating
a relay booster valve on trailers is incorrect. The agency notes that the majority of trailers required a relay booster
valve to comply with the requirements adopted on May 3, 1989 (54 FR 13890, 85&hyph;07, Notice 3). However, the control
line pressure requirements of the August 1992 notice did not have the effect of requiring that an additional valve
be added to the system. The August 1992 requirements only required that valves used to comply with the May 1989 requirements
did not induce unwanted pressure differentials. Therefore, NHTSA believes that the amendment in question did not
have the effect of requiring a relay booster valve where none was required before.

Other Hardware Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA further believes that Mr. Crail's assertions about the rulemaking's hardware costs are incorrect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency considered these same assertions about hardware costs when it was developing the August 1992 rule. In that
rule, NHTSA indicated that some manufacturers might have to use higher quality relay valves than they presently use
to meet the requirements, but that these higher quality valves are not significantly more expensive. In addition,
the agency acknowledged that manufacturers may have to modify existing valve designs to control pressure differential.
However, the agency estimated that such modified valves would cost only a few dollars more per trailer. Moreover,
the final rule also indicated that these upgraded valves would only be needed on towing trailers. The total annual
production of towing trailers is roughly 21,400. Therefore, the agency concluded that the aggregate costs for additional
equipment on all trailers to comply with the control line pressure balance requirements would be relatively small.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its review of Mr. Crail's petition for reconsideration, NHTSA once again reviewed the hardware costs associated
with the control line pressure balance requirements. The agency concludes that valves that would be needed to meet
the August 1992 rule are not significantly more expensive that those used prior to the rule. To illustrate, Bendix,
a valve manufacturer, has designed a new valve that it advertises as complying with these new requirements. These
valves actually cost less than valves previously used in trailers to control for pressure balance. Accordingly,
NHTSA continues to believe that its initial determination that the hardware costs associated with the rulemaking
are not unreasonable is correct.

Testing Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Crail also asserted that the agency seriously underestimated the costs to trailer manufacturers for testing
compliance with the new dynamic test procedure. As noted above, NHTSA stated in the final rule that the mini-tractor
test rights that are currently used to test compliance with other requirements in Standard No. 121 could be readily
upgraded to check for pressure differentials at an added cost of about $300. Mr. Crail asserted that, on top of the $300
costs estimated by NHTSA, there would be nearly $5900 of additional costs to record the pressure data collected during
the prescribed test. The $5900 estimate consisted of two sets of pressure transducers and cables, at a cost of $600
per set, a strip chart recorder, at a cost of about $4000, and approximately $700 in labor costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Crail also stated that trailer test rigs commonly used by trailer manufacturers cannot be simply adapted to the
additional tasks of recording pressure tracers simultaneously at both the trailer's input and delivery gladhands,
as the agency suggested in the preamble to the final rule. Instead, Mr. Crail asserted that manufacturers would have
to equip the test rig with at least three additional pressure transducers and a recording device capable of three channel
input.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees. Through tests conducted at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) and conversations with a
Gooch Brake and Equipment Company, a manufacturer of mini-tractor test rigs, NHTSA concludes that trailer manufacturers
need not equip their test rigs with additional pressure transducers and a recording device costing approximately
$5900. As explained in the final rule, most trailer manufacturers use test rigs, known as ``variables'' test equipment,
for a variety of timing and pressure testing of vehicles in certifying compliance with Standard No. 121. Therefore,
a manufacturer typically will not have to procure test equipment solely to comply with the new rule. Rather, most manufacturers
can easily upgrade their current test rig to evaluate the pressure differential through the following modifications
at a cost of about $300: Adding a hose, gladhands, and an air flow restrictor, for approximately $100; and upgrading
the test rig's software, for $200. While it is true that the total cost of ``variables'' test equipment would be approximately
$6000 to $7000, a trailer manufacturer that already owns the test rig would incur an incremental cost of $300 to comply
with this amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA further notes that the petitioner's assertions appear to be based on a belief that a trailer manufacturer must
use the test procedure and testing equipment described in Standard No. 121. Such a belief is incorrect. The National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act) requires each manufacturer to certify that its vehicles meet Standard
No. 121. Accordingly, the vehicle must meet the applicable requirements of Standard No. 121 when tested by NHTSA according
to the test procedure specified in the standard. However, the Safety Act does not require a manufacturer to use the
standard's test procedure or specified test equipment. A manufacturer may use a variety of means to certify compliance,
including, among other things, engineering analyses, actual testing, and computer simulations, provided that
due care is exercised in making its certification. If the manufacturer exercised due care, it would not be subject
to civil penalties for manufacturing and selling a noncomplying vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, a manufacturer need not conduct these operations itself. Manufacturers can utilize the services of independent
engineers and testing laboratories. The can also join together through trade associations to sponsor testing or
analysis. Another alternative is for manufacturers, such as trailer manufacturers, to rely on testing and analysis
performed by other parties, such as the valve manufacturers. Valve manufacturers perform extensive analyses and
tests of their products and, because they seek to sell those products, have a strong incentive to provide their customers
(the trailer manufacturers) with information that the trailer manufacturer can use to certify the vehicle to the
applicable standards. For example, Bendix currently provides this type of information to vehicle manufacturers
regarding Bendix's new valve for the new pressure control requirements. Based on the above considerations, NHTSA
believes that a trailer manufacturer can certify compliance with the control pressure differential amendments
without facing an unreasonable cost burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reexamining this matter in response to Mr. Crail's petition, NHTSA reaffirms its conclusion that the new control
line pressure balance requirements will result in relatively small costs for trailer manufacturers. The agency
also believes that its conclusions in the final rule are appropriate. Accordingly, the petitioner's request to reconsider
the amendment to Standard No. 121 is denied.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was prepared by the New England Fishery Management
Council (Council) in consultation with the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils, under
the provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A notice of availability for the proposed Amendment was published on August 10, 1993, (58 FR 42522) and a proposed
implementing rule was published on September 2, 1993, (58 FR 46606). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Approval of Amendment 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 was approved on November 5, 1993. However, concerns were raised about the potential for Amendment 4 to
cause excessive harvest of small sea scallops the first few years of implementation, if a supplemental average minimum
meat count measure were not included as a management measure in the Amendment. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
NOAA (AA), approved the Amendment, concurring with the Regional Director who stated that the issue of increased mortality
on small scallops in the early years of the program was considered by the Council during deliberations by the Plan Development
Team (where representatives of both the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and the NMFS Northeast Regional Office
participate), the Sea Scallop Oversight Committee, and the Council. The rebuilding schedule and effort reductions
in the Amendment are designed to strike a balance between an accelerated rate of recovery and the minimization of economic
and social disruption to the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Amendment was approved, NMFS remains concerned about the near-term level of protection of small sea
scallops. This concern is reflected in the Regional Director's approval letter to the Council, dated November 5,
1993, which advised the Council that the Regional Director will be carefully monitoring the initial impact of the
Amendment on fishing mortality rates of small sea scallops. If fishing mortality rates increase beyond anticipated
levels, the Council is expected to implement immediately adjustments under the framework measures of the Amendment
to protect sea scallop stocks adequately.

Overfishing Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 includes a definition of overfishing and a determination that the sea scallop resource is overfished.
The preamble to the proposed rule included the definition of overfishing. It is not repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce fishing mortality below the overfishing definition threshold, the Council will reduce fishing effort
by approximately 40 percent over seven years. Because the impact of effort controls and gear restrictions on the resource
is uncertain, the Council estimates that actual effort reduction needed could be as low as 35 percent or as high as 70
percent.

Approved Vessel Tracking System (VTS) Vendors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule for Amendment 4, NMFS requested that vendors interested in having their VTS certified for use
in this fishery submit information showing that the VTS meets the specifications contained in the proposed rule.
NMFS has reviewed the information submitted by several vendors and will make available to interested parties the
names and addresses of those vendors who appear to meet the specifications. The opportunity remains open for interested
parties to submit their information to the NMFS and to be added to the list of approved vendors if it appears to the NMFS
that they can meet the specifications. It is not the intent of the NMFS to assure that the acquisition and installation
of a VTS unit from any one of these vendors meets the requirement of this rule as specified at &sect;650.25. Vessel owners
must demonstrate that the system purchased, from the list of approved vendors, is capable of meeting the operational
requirements of the regulations by providing information on vessel position and vessel status. It is the intent of
the NMFS that until the vessel owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that the VTS unit
is fully operational and is providing the required information to the NMFS, the vessel owner/operator will not be
eligible to receive a permit unless the Regional Director authorizes the use of a call-in system in accordance with
&sect;650.26(a)(3).

Effective Date of Management Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific management measures that will be used to achieve the necessary reduction in fishing effort include the
following: A moratorium on most new entrants into the scallop fishery; allocations of days-at-sea (DAS) that vessels
may fish for scallops based on three vessel groups (Full-time, Part-time, and Occasional); a requirement to purchase
and install a VTS unit for Full-time and Part-time vessels and a call-in system for Occasional vessels to monitor DAS;
permits for vessel operators and dealers; an open access scallop permit for vessels landing no more than 400 pounds
(181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or no more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops per trip; limitations
on upgrading of vessel size and engine horsepower; a prohibition on acquiring more than a 5 percent ownership interest
in the total number of limited access scallop vessels; mandatory reporting for permitted vessels and dealers; crew-size
limits; maximum dredge and trawl sweep size restrictions; minimum ring and mesh size restrictions; framework measures
to adjust the effort control and other measures; a minimum shell height restriction; and an annual option for vessels
in the Part-time or Occasional category to fish in the next higher vessel group if they use only one dredge no more than
10.5 feet (3.2 m) in width and their crew complement (including the operator) is five or less. The preamble to the proposed
rule described the management measures and their rationale, which are not repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is implementing the measures in the Amendment and proposed rule as of March 1, 1994, in order to provide opportunity
for the industry to convert to 31/4 inch rings and acquire and install VTS units; and because of the administrative
burden imposed on the NMFS by these collective measures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
implementation of a VTS; the need to issue thousands of new permits for operators, dealers and vessels; the need to
establish an appeal process for vessel owners who feel their DAS allocation is in error and/or for vessels that do not
qualify; and the need to establish details of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements required under &sect;650.7
and the DAS monitoring set forth in &sect;650.25. While the VTS is being put in place and the initial problems with that
new system are being worked out, a call-in procedure will be used to implement the DAS allocations. Existing regulations,
including the meat count measure, will remain in effect until March 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 1, 1994, the effective date of these regulations, all scallop vessel owners and operators and all scallop
dealers must have an appropriate permit, as specified under &sect;&sect;650.4, 650.5, and 650.6 in order to participate
in the fishery. In order to ensure being issued a permit, if eligible, by that date all owners, operators, and dealers
should apply for a permit as soon as possible. Application forms are available now and NMFS will attempt to mail such
forms to all known scallop vessel owners and operators and scallop dealers as soon as possible. Applications will
be processed as received. Early application, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 one filed before February 1, 1994, will help assure that the permit is issued by March 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in &sect;650.26(a)(3), until any VTS vendor is approved and the system is available, all permitted vessels
fishing under the DAS program must comply with the call-in notification provisions of &sect;650.26(b).

Comments and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS received comments on the proposed rule from one member of the Congress of the United States, five fishing industry
associations, and eight individuals. All of the comments were carefully considered during the formulation of the
final rule. Specific comments are discussed and responded to below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A member of Congress of the United States and an individual opposed the allocation of DAS because it takes Virginia,
North Carolina, and New Jersey fishermen longer to reach their fishing grounds than it takes New England fishermen.
These individuals offered days fished or a total allowable catch as an alternative. The commenters stated that the
DAS rule gives a distinct advantage to one area over another, whereas, days fished provides a level playing field for
all scallopers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council analyzed the days fished system before deciding on the DAS program, using the NMFS weighout database,
and determined that DAS is a fair reflection of a vessel's historical time at sea because it takes into consideration
the number of days a vessel spent traveling to and from the fishing grounds. The Council also determined the database
could not accurately show actual days fishing. However, the final rule includes a measure that would allow the adoption
of a days-fished system through a regulatory amendment, if data become available to support such a system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to follow a mandated time schedule for approval of
a plan amendment once it has been submitted by a Fishery Management Council. On July 30, 1993, the New England Fishery
Management Council submitted its plan amendment to NMFS, thereby triggering under the Magnuson Act the 95-day time
period in which the Secretary must approve or disapprove the amendment. Because of this limited time frame to consider
and respond to public comment and prepare the final rule for publication, NMFS allows for 45 days of public comment.
NMFS believes the 45 days given for comment are adequate.

 Due to the projected initial volume of applications for Operator permits required under Amendment 4, the NMFS needs
the flexibility to take 30 days to process and mail permits. However, NMFS will make every effort to process permits
sooner. NMFS will make available permit applications well in advance of March 1, 1994, in order to maximize the likelihood
that all participants in the scallop fishery will have the ability to obtain a permit before March 1, 1994.

 The sections have been rewritten and now require that within 15 days after a change in the application information,
a written report of the change be submitted and received by the Regional Director. Requiring all changes to be sent
by registered or certified mail would be too burdensome. Nevertheless, permit holders could choose to send the notice
of change by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, if they want to verify that timely notification
occurred.

 Requiring double links between rings throughout the entire dredge is necessary to insure the escapement of small
sea scallops in order to mitigate the impact of removing the meat-count-age-of-entry requirement. The NMFS recognizes
that this may require some change in industry practices but considers these measures to be necessary to the overall
success of the management program.

 The transfer prohibition reflects the Council intent to control and equalize the amount of fishing pressure associated
with allocated DAS. From an enforcement perspective, the prohibition is considered critical because it would be
difficult to detect violations unless all transfers are prohibited.

 A high level of monitoring is required to ensure the effectiveness of the management program and to avoid imposing
more restrictive measures than necessary on the industry because of insufficient data. This provision gives the
Regional Director the discretion to require a vessel to carry an observer to enhance data collection, if necessary.
In most cases where observer coverage is considered necessary, the Regional Director will first attempt to enlist
voluntary participation. Observers would be provided through existing NMFS observer programs. The vessel would
not have to pay the salary for the observer but would have to provide adequate accommodations and food. Neither NMFS
nor the government is responsible for providing insurance coverage for the observer; each vessel should provide
appropriate coverage.

 Most scallop dredge vessels currently have their crew members shuck scallop meats by hand while at sea. The amount
and size of scallops selected for shucking is a function of the crew size and the catch rates. The crew size restriction
reflects the Council's intention to cap the fishing power of these vessels at sea by limiting their processing (shucking)
capacity. Currently, the average crew size on sea scallop vessels is nine; in the past, crew sizes were larger but this
was a reflection of the condition of the resource. NMFS is not aware of any data or information indicating that the limitation
on crew size will affect safety at sea.

 This requirement complies with the Magnuson Act for establishing a system for limited access to a fishery. If a system
for limiting access to a fishery is included in a plan, the Magnuson Act requires the Council and the Secretary to ``take
into account'' such factors as present participation in the fishery, historical fishing practices and dependence
on the fishery, and capability of vessels to be used in other fisheries. The Council and NMFS considered all of these
factors in establishing criteria required to qualify for full participation in the scallop fishery. A control date
was announced on March 2, 1989, which gave notice to participants and potential participants of the fact that future
participation in the fishery may be limited for vessels that entered the fishery after the control date.

The purpose of the control date was to discourage speculative entry into the fishery while development of Amendment
4 progressed. In deciding to add the requirement that a vessel must have landed more than 400 pounds of scallops on at
least one trip in 1988&hyph;1989 in order to be eligible to participate in the fishery, the Council was addressing
the factor of historical fishing practices and dependence on the fishery. Later in its deliberations, the Council
recognized that not all participants may have received timely notice of the control date and, therefore, allowed
a limited exception for vessels purchased after the control date if the vessels had any participation in the fishery
between 1982 and 1990. With respect to determining allocations of DAS, the Council expanded historical participation
to include 1985&hyph;1990 in order to recognize longstanding historical dependence on the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also adopts a Council recommendation to establish an exemption to the limited access fishery for vessels
that land less than 400 pounds of scallops per day, in order to provide some opportunity for small-scale operations
and new entrants to participate in the scallop fishery. Therefore, the Council's and NMFS's decision to rely on the
criteria contained in the final rule represents a balancing of present and historical participation in the fishery
with the need to reduce fishing mortality by limiting the number of full-time participants in the fishery.

 This requirement is necessary to provide protection for small scallops and to help control the amount of fishing mortality
associated with a DAS. This measure is designed to help mitigate the impact of removal of the meat count which provides
age-at-entry controls. It is not expected, however, to afford age-at-entry protection equal to the current meat
count system.

 NMFS contacted William D. DuPaul, Ph.D., of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, principal investigator on
the experimental study, regarding the comments received. He commented that the first fishing trip of the experiment
had recently been completed by a commercial vessel out of the port of New Bedford and that the larger rings allowed for
significantly more escapement than the 3-inch rings currently in use by the industry. DuPaul also commented that
the study is ongoing and that it is too early to draw any conclusions from the one trip taken. Final results on the experiment
are not expected until work is completed in late winter of 1994. Therefore, NMFS has not considered the preliminary
results of the ongoing experiment for the purposes of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the best scientific information available at this time, however, there seems to be a correlation between
ring size and size of scallops retained by scallop dredges. Because removing the meat count measure effectively removes
all age-at-entry controls, the Council and NMFS have determined that implementation of minimum ring size requirements
simultaneously with removal of the meat count measure is critical to the achievement of the amendment's objectives.
Failure to provide some age-at-entry limitations could seriously jeopardize the ability of the management measures
to achieve plan objectives in the time required.

 National Standard 5, 16 U.S.C. 1851(a)(5), states that conservation and management measures, where practicable,
should promote efficiency. This standard also provides, however, that the goals of efficiency may be balanced against
other factors such as social and biologic. In its deliberations, the Council explicitly considered possible gains
in efficiency in allowing DAS to be combined, but ultimately rejected such a measure because of socioeconomic concerns
of preserving current fishing practices and traditions at the outset of the management program. The Council was concerned
that allowing combination or transfer of DAS allocations, at this time, may precipitously lead to aggregation of
fishing rights in the hands of a few, thereby challenging the current type of fishing operations associated with the
northeast region. Moreover, it would be impracticable to allow such fishing rights to be transferred, at this time,
before the effectiveness of the management measures could be assessed. The Council did provide, however, that measures
that may enhance efficiency can be considered and adopted through the framework procedure specified in the rule.
NMFS concurs in the Council's deliberations and conclusions concerning these measures.

 The rule does not pre-determine whether the moratorium will be lifted. The rule provides only that the Council may
consider such a measure. If and when the Council considers such a measure, the plan requires that it be subject to public
comment and that commenters have adequate opportunity to respond. If the Council decides to address this subject
under the framework specifications all interested parties will be contacted and will have the opportunity to comment.
The Council could adopt such measures only if it can be demonstrated that they are necessary to meet the goals and objectives
of the FMP, including socioeconomic goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to clarify that the appeal process under this paragraph applies only to limited access scallop permit denial.
The paragraph was further modified to add the phrase ``if the vessel has on board a letter of authorization from the
Regional Director'' to clarify the requirements that vessels fishing under appeal must carry on board the letter
issued under &sect;650.4(a)(9)(vi)(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.4, paragraph (a)(9)(vi)(D) was modified to add the sentence, ``If the appeal is denied, The Regional
Director shall send a notice of denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt
of the notice of denial.'', to clarify how vessel owners will be notified in the event of a denial of the appeal of a limited
access scallop permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.5, paragraph (c) was modified to add the sentence, ``Further, such operators must agree as a condition
of this permit that if the permit is suspended or revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator cannot be on board
any fishing vessel issued a Federal Fisheries Permit or any vessel subject to Federal fishing regulations while the
vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading.'' This phrase was included under &sect;650.5(n) in the proposed rule and
is repeated in this section in the final rule to increase awareness of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.5, paragraph (n) was modified to add the phrase ``while the vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading'',
to allow vessel operators to conduct business activity on board a vessel when the vessel is not engaged in any type of
fishing activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;650.6, paragraph (g) was modified to add the phrase, ``or ownership changes,'' to clarify that the permit
does not transfer with the change in ownership of the business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(1) was modified to replace ``provide'' with ``mail'' to clarify the way in which the
reports will be submitted. The paragraph was further modified to contain the phrase, ``name and permit number of the
vessels from which fish are landed or received;'' and the sentence, ``If no fish is purchased during the week, a report
so stating must be submitted.'', to clarify reporting requirements for dealers and to be consistent with the reporting
requirements of other regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(2) was modified to read, ``Required data are the number of employees handling fishery
products by month. Reports for a given calendar year shall be submitted to: NMFS Statistics, 166 Water Street, Woods
Hole, MA 02543, and must be postmarked by February 10 of the following year.'' This change further details the requirements
for this reporting requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.7, paragraph (a)(5) was modified to add the following sentence, ``If no product was purchased during
a week, a report so stating must be submitted.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.9, paragraph (b)(1) was subdivided into paragraphs (i) and (ii). Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) was added in
order to clarify paragraph (b)(1)(i) by prohibiting more than one trip per calendar day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.9, paragraph (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(17), and (c)(4), the phrase ``Possess on board or'' was
added to clarify the prohibition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.9, the following changes were made to clarify the prohibitions. Paragraph (c) was subdivided into paragraphs
(c)(1) through (c)(7). Paragraph (d)(4) was changed to paragraph (d)(4)(i), and a new paragraph, (d)(4)(ii), was
added. Paragraphs (d)(10) through (d)(15) were redesignated as paragraphs (d)(11) through (d)(16), and a new paragraph
(d)(10) was added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.20, paragraph (a) was modified to add the phrase, ``that may be landed, or possessed at or after landing,''
in order to clarify that the minimum shell height size is not an at-sea measure. Parallel changes were made to sections
650.20(b) and 650.9(a)(1) to reflect this clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (a) was modified to add the phrase ``in possession of more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked
scallops or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell scallops, or fishing for scallops,'' to clarify that certain trawl
gear restrictions are also possession restrictions applicable to any vessel possessing more than 40 pounds of shucked
scallops or 5 bushels of in-shell scallops. Similar changes were made to &sect;650.21(a) (1)&hyph;(2) and &sect;650.9(b)(8).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (b) was modified by deleting the phrase ``holding a Federal sea scallop permit under &sect;650.4
and'' and adding the phrases ``of more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked scallops or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell
scallops'' and all vessels issued limited access scallop permits and fishing under the DAS allocation program,''
to clarify that the dredge restrictions apply to all dredge vessels in possession of more than 40 pounds of shucked
scallops or 5 bushels of in-shell scallops. In &sect;650.21, paragraphs (b) (1)&hyph;(3) were modified to add the
phrase ``in use by or in possession of such vessels'' to clarify that the dredge restrictions are possession restrictions
also. The corresponding prohibition sections to these restrictions, &sect;650.9, paragraphs (b) (11)&hyph;(15)
and &sect;650.9, paragraphs (c) (2)&hyph;(6), were changed accordingly to reflect these clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (b)(iii), the sentence, ``The ring size will be the average of the measurements of any
series of 20 consecutive rings.'' was deleted. This provision had been added by NMFS with the intent of facilitating
enforcement. However, upon further consideration, it was determined that allowing an average minimum ring size
would necessitate difficult and problematic measuring requirements and possibly would not be consistent with the
Council's intent that no rings should be less than 31/4 inches. NMFS is developing a standard measuring device and
procedures to determine minimum ring sizes and will publish a description of such device and procedures in the

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.21, paragraph (e) was modified to add the phrase, ``in addition to or notwithstanding other restrictions
in this Part'' to clarify that vessels operating under the small dredge program are still subject to other restrictions
in &sect;650 unless modified by the special provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.24, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) was expanded to clarify the process for counting days at sea under the call-in
system.

In &sect;650.24, paragraph (f)(6) was modified to add the phrase ``if the vessel has on board an authorizing letter
from the Regional Director''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.25, paragraph (b) was modified to cross reference correctly the call-in procedures described in &sect;650.26(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraph (a) was modified to correctly cross reference the small dredge program in &sect;650.21(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) were modified to indicate that the Regional Director is to be notified
``through the VTS''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraph (a)(3) was modified to add the phrase ``or not functional''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraph (b) was modified to add language that is more specific regarding the call-in notification
requirements of the vessel owner or authorized representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.26, paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4), the requirement that vessel owners or their authorized representative
call-in 2 hours prior to leaving port and within 1 hour of returning to port was replaced with the provision that the
DAS will begin and end upon receipt of the call. The Regional Director has determined that this less restrictive requirement
is supportable by current technology without compromising the enforceability of this measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.40, paragraph (c), the phrase ``After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at any
other time,'' was added in order to clarify the Council's procedures when it is considering changes in management
measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;650.40, paragraph (e)(3), the sentence ``The Council may reconsider its prior action and recommend a new
action under paragraph (d) of this section.'' was deleted because it is considered to be unnecessary.

The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) determined that the FMP amendment that this rule would implement is consistent
with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making
that determination, has taken into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared a final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) for Amendment 4, which was filed
by the Environmental Protection Agency with the Office of the Federal Register. The Environmental Protection Agency
has recommended that the National Marine Fisheries Service conduct studies in the near future to monitor the effect
of scallop dredges on bottom habitat. The AA has determined that the preferred alternative of Amendment 4 versus the
status quo is environmentally preferable upon review of the FSEIS and public comments. The FSEIS demonstrates that
the preferred alternative contains management measures to rebuild the stock of Atlantic sea scallops, provides
positive economic and social benefits to the fishing industry in the long term, and provides balance in the ecosystem
in terms of the sea scallop resource.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule may have significant effects on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. For the purposes of the RFA, the RIR is retitled as a
RIR/regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). According to the RIR/RFA prepared by the Council, the management measures
will have some negative impact on small entities. There are approximately 400&hyph;600 vessels that rely on scallops
for a portion of their revenue. All are considered small entities. Of these, more than 150 vessels would not qualify
for the vessel moratorium and may have to redirect effort into other fisheries. Approximately 63 percent of the 150
vessels, however, depend on sea scallops for 15 percent or less of their total revenue and may be able to compensate
by participating in the general scallop fishery (no moratorium, landings up to 400 pounds (181.44 kg) per trip). For
those vessels qualifying for the limited access fishery, there are significant short-term losses in revenue that
are offset by long-term gains.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule contains eight new collection-of-information requirements and also revises four existing requirements
previously approved by OMB under Control Numbers 0648&hyph;0202 and 0648&hyph;0229 and 0648&hyph;0018. These
collection-of-information requirements have been approved by OMB. Nevertheless, public comments are invited

as of the date the vessel it is replacing was initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified on a
valid application for a permit under this section; except that, the horsepower of the replacement vessel may not exceed
the horsepower of the vessel being replaced if the horsepower of the vessel being replaced has been increased through
upgrade or vessel replacement from that specified when the vessel being replaced initially applied for a 1994 limited
access scallop permit; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The replacement vessel's length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage may not exceed by more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage of the vessel being replaced, based on specifications
provided in the initial 1994 application for a limited access scallop permit; except that, the length, gross registered
tonnage, and net tonnage of the replacement vessel may not exceed the length, gross registered tonnage, and net tonnage
of the vessel initially issued a limited access scallop permit if any or all of these specifications have been increased
through upgrade or vessel replacement from that specified when the vessel being replaced initially applied for a
1994 limited access scallop permit. For purposes of this paragraph, a vessel not required to be documented under Title
46, U.S.C. will be considered to be 5 gross registered tons. For undocumented vessels, net tonnage does not apply.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upgraded vessel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To remain eligible to retain a valid limited access scallop permit, or to apply for, or renew a limited access scallop
permit, a vessel may be upgraded, whether through refitting or replacement, only if the upgrade complies with the
following limitations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The vessel's horsepower may be increased, whether through refitting or replacement, only once. Such an increase
may not exceed 20 percent of the horsepower of the vessel initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified
in that vessel's permit application for a 1994 limited access scallop permit; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The vessel's length, gross registered tonnage and net tonnage may be upgraded, whether through refitting or
replacement, only once. Such an increase shall not exceed 10 percent each of the length, gross registered tonnage,
and net tonnage of the vessel initially issued a 1994 limited access scallop permit as specified in that vessel's application
for a 1994 limited access scallop permit. This limitation allows only one upgrade, at which time any or all three specifications
of vessel size may be increased. This type of upgrade may be done separately from an engine horsepower upgrade.

Compliance with the specified shell-height standards will be determined by inspection and enforcement at or after
landing, including, the time when the scallops are received or possessed by a dealer or person acting in the capacity
of a dealer, as follows: the authorized officer will take samples of forty scallops each at random from the total amount
of scallops in possession. The person in possession of the scallops may request that as many as ten samples (400 scallops)
be examined as a sample group. A sample group fails to comply with the standard if more than ten percent of all scallops
sampled are less than the shell height specified by the standard. The shell height shall be measured in a straight line
from the hinge of the scallop to the outermost part of the curve on the leading edge. The total amount of scallops in possession
will be deemed in violation of this regulation and subject to forfeiture if the sample group fails to comply with the
standard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A vessel's average number of days of directed scallop fishing for purposes of assigning the vessel to one of the categories
specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined by applying one of the following formulas to the data,
information, or other credible evidence available to the Regional Director. Scallop DAS for this purpose is defined
as the total days at sea on trips with landings of more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels
(17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The following formulas apply to all vessels qualifying for limited access scallop permits, with the exception
of vessels that qualify under paragraph &sect;650.4(a)(1)(i)(C). The DAS formula applicable to that group of vessels
is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Vessel owners may choose their 1990 history under paragraph (b)(1)(i)
of this section, or a calculation based on the 1985&hyph;1990 history, as applicable, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)
of this section. DAS are calculated from the formulas below and the result is applied to the DAS categories described
in paragraph (a) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1990 fishing history. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For any vessel that fished for scallops in 1990, the number of scallop DAS may be determined by calculating the total
number of DAS on scallop trips ending in 1990; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For vessels with history in the scallop fishery between 1985 and 1990, inclusive, the number of years history is determined
as follows. With the exception of the adjustments specified under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this
section, vessels whose calculated scallop history is based on a formula below must use their entire history in the
scallop fishery and may not elect to use a formula based on fewer years history in the fishery.

Pro-ration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a limited access vessel entered the scallop fishery for the first time during the relevant time period, the first
year shall be pro-rated to a full year by pro-rating on an annual basis the number of DAS the vessel actually incurred
on trips landing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell
scallops to determine the number of days at sea the vessel would have incurred had the vessel been in the fishery for
the full year. The pro-ration formula is as follows: The total number of scallop DAS in that year is divided by the percentage
of the year the vessel was in the fishery (by month). In pro-rating the days for such vessels, the Regional Director
shall take into account the date the vessel entered the fishery, the vessel's subsequent fishing history, and other
relevant information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vessel owners who purchased their vessel during the 1985&hyph;1990 time period may request that the DAS formulas
be based solely on their individual history in the scallop fishery, excluding all previous owner's scallop histories.
Under this option a vessel's first year in the fishery may be pro-rated based on the criteria specified in paragraph
(b)(1)(iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For vessels qualifying for a limited access scallop permit under paragraph &sect;650.4(a)(1)(i)(C), pro-rate
to a full year the total number of DAS for trips the vessel would have fished and landed over 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of
shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops in 1990 based on the actual number of DAS
the vessel did fish in 1990 and the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Then, calculate the
average number of DAS for trips landing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or more than 50 U.S. bushels
(17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops for the years 1991 and 1992. The number of days to determine the category shall be the
lower number between the pro-rated 1990 days and the average of DAS in 1991 and 1992.

for which it qualifies. A vessel whose owner/operator has declared it out of the scallop fishery pursuant to the provisions
of &sect;650.26, or has used up its allocated DAS, may leave port without being assessed a DAS as long as it does not possess
or land more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.61 hl) of in-shell scallops and complies

DAS shall accrue in hourly increments, with all partial hours counted as full hours. A DAS is calculated beginning
when a vessel leaves port and ending when the vessel returns to port as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) DAS for vessels that are under the VTS monitoring system described in &sect;650.26(a) are counted beginning with
the first hourly location signal received showing that the vessel crossed the COLREGS Demarcation Line leaving port
and ending with the first hourly location signal received showing that the vessel crossed the COLREGS Demarcation
Line upon its return to port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) DAS for vessels fishing under the call-in notification system described in &sect;650.26(b) are counted beginning

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A vessel, for which an appeal of its DAS category has been initiated, may fish under the DAS allocation allowed under
the next higher category than the vessel's initial category placement if the vessel has on board a letter of authorization
from the Regional Director, regardless of what category the vessel is appealing to be placed in, and is subject to all
requirements applicable to such category of vessels unless otherwise exempted. That is, if a vessel was initially
placed in the Part-time category, that vessel may fish up to the maximum number of DAS allocated to Full-time vessels
until the Regional Director has made a final determination on the appeal. If a vessel is initially placed in the Occasional
category, that vessel may fish up to the DAS allocated to Part-time vessels, regardless of what category the Occasional
vessel is appealing to be placed in, until the Regional Director has made a final determination on the appeal. Any DAS
spent fishing for scallops shall be counted against the DAS allocation of the category that the vessel is ultimately
placed in. If, before this appeal is decided, a vessel exceeds the number of DAS it is finally allocated after appeal,
the excess DAS will be subtracted from the vessel's allocation of DAS in 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, shall not permit the input of false positions; furthermore, if a system uses satellites to determine position, satellite
selection should be automatic to provide an optimal fix and should not be capable of being manually overridden by any
person on board a fishing vessel or by the vessel owner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The VTS shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of weather and environmental conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The VTS shall be capable of tracking vessels in all U.S. waters in the Atlantic Ocean from the shoreline of each
coastal state to a line 215 nautical miles offshore and shall provide position accuracy to within 400 meters (1,300
feet); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) The VTS shall provide accurate hourly position transmissions every day of the year. In addition, the VTS shall
allow polling of individual vessels or any set of vessels at any time and receive position reports in real time. For
the purposes of this specification, ``real time'' shall constitute data that reflect a delay of 15 minutes or less
between the displayed information and the vessel's actual position; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The VTS shall be capable of providing network message communications between the vessel and shore. The VTS shall
allow NMFS to initiate communications or data transfer at any time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The VTS vendor shall be capable of transmitting position data to a NMFS-designated computer system via a modem
at a minimum speed of 9600 baud. Transmission shall be in ASCII text in a file format acceptable to NMFS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The VTS shall be capable of providing vessel locations relative to international boundaries and fishery management
areas;

Failure of a VTS unit to transmit an hourly signal of a vessel's position shall be presumed to be a DAS, or fraction thereof,
for as long as the unit fails to transmit a signal. A preponderance of evidence that the failure to transmit was due to
an unavoidable malfunction or disruption of the transmission that occurred while the vessel was declared out of the
scallop fishery or was not at sea will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management
measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures should be published as a final rule,
the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time
to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected
industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures;

a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures, and if after reviewing
the Council's recommendation and supporting information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended management measures and determines that the recommended
management measures may be published as a final rule based on the factors specified in paragraph (d) of this section,
the action will be published in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS issues this notice to implement a temporary adjustment of the meat count and shell height standards for the Atlantic
sea scallop fishery. Its purpose is to take into account the fact that at the end of the spawning season, the scallop
resource is dominated by small scallops. This action increases the average meat count standard to 33 meats per pound
(MPP) (33 meats per 0.45 kg) and the shell height standard to 311/16 inches (94 mm).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations at 50 CFR part 650 implementing the Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sea scallops (FMP) authorize
the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to adjust temporarily the meat count/shell height standards
(standards) upon finding that specific criteria are met. These criteria, which appear at &sect;650.22(c), include
the finding that: (1) The objective of the FMP would be achieved more readily, or would be better served through an adjustment
of the standards; (2) the recommended alteration in the standards would not reduce expected catch over the following
year by more than 5 percent from that which would have been expected under the prevailing standard; (3) the recommended
standards for meat count and shell height are consistent with each other; and (4) 50 percent of the harvestable biomass
is at scallop sizes smaller than those consistent with the prevailing standards, and a temporary relaxation of the
standards would not jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. Adjustments of the standards may remain in effect
for up to twelve months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the criteria, the Regional Director made a proposal to adjust the standards. In accordance
with the regulations, a public hearing was held during the December 9, 1993, New England Fishery Management Council
(Council) meeting and comments on this recommendation were solicited. Attendance at the public hearing was low;
only one State Director and one member of the industry commented. The comments were in support of the recommended adjustment.
No written comments were received on the recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

After consideration of the full record, including: (1) Comments from the public, (2) comments from the Council, (3)
new resource and assessment information, and (4) available information on the fishery and the industry, the Regional
Director has decided to adjust the standards to 33 MPP (0.45 kg) with a corresponding shell height standard of 311/16
inches (94 mm) for the period February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This adjustment to the standards coincides with the end of the 10 percent spawning season adjustment approved under
Amendment 2 to the FMP (53 FR 23634). This action was also taken in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, at the end of the spawning
season adjustment period. Survey information shows that abundance and recruitment values for the sea scallop resource
are down and that the resource is dominated by small scallops. This makes attaining an average MPP standard difficult
because of the scarcity of large scallops available for mixing. Vessel costs increase because additional time and
fuel must be spent in search of large scallops, discard mortality increases on small scallops, and landings decrease.
These factors conflict with the objectives of the FMP and, therefore, criterion 1 outlined above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action meets criterion 2 because it is not expected to reduce catch over the following year by more than 5 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3 states that the meat count and shell height standards will remain consistent with each other. Based on
analysis of historical survey data, the 33 MPP (0.45 kg) is consistent with a corresponding shell height standard
of 311/16 inches (94 mm), thereby, conforming with criterion 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 4 states that 50 percent of the harvestable biomass must be at sizes smaller than the prevailing standard
(30 MPP). Recent survey results show that 50 percent of the harvestable biomass consists of scallops smaller than
30 MPP. Thus this portion of criterion 4 is met. Criterion 4 also states that a temporary relaxation of the standards
must not jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. Sea scallops have their first significant spawning at age
four. Age four sea scallops range from approximately 30 count to 50 count. The Regional Director recognizes that caution
must be exercised when recommending a temporary adjustment to the meat count standard within this range. It is unlikely,
however, that an adjustment of this magnitude, for a one month period, will jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This temporary adjustment will be effective February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994. During this period, the
meat count standard will be 33 MPP (33 meats per 0.45 kg) and the shell height standard 311/16 inches (94 mm). After February
28, 1994, sea scallop FMP Amendment 4 will be effective, and the meat count will no longer be in use as a management measure.

 The Army Corps of Engineers is establishing a danger zone in the waters of an unnamed tributary of Foster Creek, a tributary
of the Cooper River. The danger zone generally borders the Charleston Naval Base and the Naval Weapons Station, Charleston
and Berkeley Counties, South Carolina. The danger zone is needed to protect the public from the dangers associated
with the possibility of an errant round from an existing pistol range impacting in the unnamed creek. In addition to
these regulations, the Navy has received authorization from the Charleston District Engineer to erect a fence and
a gate across the creek to control passage into the area. Although the area is not closed to the public on a full time basis,
the Commanding Officer, Naval Weapons Station, may close the area at any time and reopen the area when he/she determines
that such restrictions may be terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commanding Officer, Naval Weapons Station, Charleston, South Carolina, has requested that the Corps expand
the existing restricted areas by establishing a danger zone in the waters of the Cooper River and its tributaries pursuant
to its authorities in section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1917 (33 U.S.C. 1) and section XIX of the Army Appropriations
Act of 1919 (33 U.S.C. 3). The danger zone will generally border the Charleston Naval Base and Naval Weapons Station.
The danger zone is needed to provide a margin of safety for vessels operating in the unnamed creek which is a tributary
to Foster Creek by prohibiting their entry into the area when determined appropriate by the Commanding Officer of
the Naval Weapons Station. A firing range for pistol training exists on an upland area close to the waterway. Although
the weapons are not directed or intentionally fired into the waterway, an errant round from the pistol range could
impact into the water. Vessels shall also be prevented from entering the area by a fence and gate across the waterway.
Closure of the gate and prohibited entry by these regulations shall be as required by the Commanding Officer of the
Naval Weapons Station.

accordingly, we are publishing these regulations as final without change.

This rule is issued with respect to a military function of the Defense Department and accordingly, the provisions
of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. These rules have been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Public
Law 96&hyph;354), which requires the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses (i.e., small businesses and small
governmental jurisdictions). These regulations may have a minimal impact on individuals fishing in the area. However,
these regulations will not prohibit their entry into the area except on an intermittent basis as required for the Governments'
operations. The area is not known to support a commercial fishery and will not affect the food fishing industry. In
addition, there will be no fees or charges imposed by the base commander for registration or entry into the area. This
will not result in any increase in costs to those fishermen. Accordingly, the preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not warranted.

This action amends appendix D, part 91, of the Federal Aviation Regulations to accurately reflect the name of the new
Denver, Colorado, airport. The new Denver International Airport, scheduled to open in March 1994, will replace the
Denver Stapleton Airport. Appendix D, part 91, lists locations, including Denver, Colorado, where special operating
restrictions apply. This action will not affect any procedures or practices currently in place, but it is necessary
to correctly state the name of the new Denver airport.

Appendix D, part 91, lists airports/locations where special operating restrictions apply. Section 1 lists the locations
at which the requirements of &sect;91.215(b)(2) apply. (Aircraft operating within 30 nautical miles of an airport,
listed in Section 1, from the surface upward to 10,000 feet mean sea level must be equipped with a Mode C transponder.)
Section 3 lists the locations where fixed-wing special visual flight rule (SVFR) operations are prohibited. Both
