SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would change the boundaries of five of the seven districts established under the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Plan (Plan) to apportion membership on the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board). This action
is necessary to reflect shifts in production since the original districts were established. The Plan requires the
periodic realignment of the districts based on shifts in production to ensure equitable representation of producers
and handlers on the Board.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) (7 CFR part 1210). The Plan is
authorized under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916), hereinafter referred to
as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. Small agricultural
service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of
less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000.
The majority of watermelon handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093, except for the Board nominee
background statement form which is assigned OMB number 0505&hyph;0001. This action adds no additional reporting
burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers
of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer
and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary
to verify their reportings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Membership on the Board is determined on the basis of two producers and two handlers for each of seven districts established
under the Plan. The districts are required to have approximately equal annual production volume. The initial (and
current) districts were based on a three-year average production derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These districts are:

7_The States of Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan provides that two years after its effective date (June 8, 1989) and at least every five years thereafter, the
Board should review the districts to determine whether realignment of districts is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When making such reviews, the Plan specifies that the Board should consider such factors as the most recent three-year
USDA production reports or Board assessment reports, if USDA production reports are unavailable, shifts and trends
in quantities of watermelons produced, and any other relevant factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan further specifies that, as a result of such reviews, the Board may realign the districts subject to the approval
of the Secretary. Any such alignment should be recommended by the Board at least six months prior to the date of the call
for nominations and should become effective at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days prior to such date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Plan, the Board appointed a subcommittee to review production and assessment collections
in the current districts. During the review, the subcommittee used USDA and State production and marketing reports,
as well as data derived from Board assessment reports and field notes. The subcommittee focused on information collected
between 1990 and 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the available information, the subcommittee recommended that the boundaries of Districts 3 through
7 be changed and that Districts 1 and 2 remain unchanged. In order for each district to represent approximately 3 million
hundredweights of annual watermelon production, the subcommittee's recommendation would: move Mississippi from
District 5 to District 3; move Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee from District 5 to District 4; move Wyoming, Montana,
Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and California north of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernadino counties
from District 7 to District 5; move Arkansas and Louisiana from District 5 to District 6; and move New Mexico from District
5 to District 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subcommittee's recommendation was approved by the Board's executive committee, and the full Board voted by mail
ballot. In the mail ballot, 19 members voted ``yes,'' 4 members voted ``no,'' and 5 members did not return a ballot.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposal would realign the districts as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has recommended that the new districts become effective for the three-year term of office which begins on
January 1, 1995. If adopted, this proposal would affect the eligibility of three current Board members and could necessitate
Board member nomination meetings for Districts 4, 5, 6, and 7 in spring 1994. In the normal cycle of nominating approximately
one-third of the Board members each year, spring 1994 nomination meetings were already planned for Districts 2 and
3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, if this proposal is adopted, it will be necessary to make a conforming change to &sect;1210.401. Section
1210.401 currently states that the districts are defined in &sect;1210.320 of the Plan. Since, this rule would define
new district boundaries in a new &sect;1210.501, this rule would also change &sect;1210.401(b) to reflect this new
section number.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 14, 1990 (55 FR 33246), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products (21 CFR part 358). The
final monograph included in &sect;358.110(c) (21 CFR 358.110(c)) products containing 15 percent salicylic acid
in a karaya gum, glycol plaster vehicle. Such products were included in the monograph based on the agency's evaluation
of data from three clinical studies (Ref. 1) (see comment 13, 55 FR 33246 at 33253). The directions for such products
were included in &sect;358.150(d)(3) (21 CFR 358.150(d)(3)), as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly.'' (If appropriate:
``Cut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply medicated plaster at bedtime, leave in place for at least 8 hours; in the morning, remove
plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed) for up to 12 weeks.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In discussing the labeling for these products (also in comment 13), the agency stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If there are any special directions that relate to using a particular product, then such information should appear
as part of the manufacturer's additional directions for the product. The monograph provides the minimum directions
necessary for use of the product. Manufacturers may supplement these directions with additional information necessary
to use their specific product. For example, the agency notes that the manufacturer's directions for its specific
product include statements to ``keep plastic film on the top of pad facing up and to apply sticky bottom side to the wart.''
The agency finds no need to include such directions in this final monograph; however, manufacturers may add such information,
as appropriate, to the labeling of their products.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequently, the agency became aware that a manufacturer of this product had the following additional statements
in its product's labeling (Ref. 2): (1) ``Smooth wart surface with emery file supplied,'' and (2) ``Apply a drop of
warm water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry.'' The agency has rereviewed the clinical studies (Ref. 1)
for this product and determined that this additional labeling information is based on the manner in which the clinical
studies were performed. The agency notes that use of an emery file and application of a drop of warm water to the wart
site as part of the directions for this type of product were not included in the labeling suggestions made by the manufacturer
when the final monograph was being prepared (see comment 13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is concerned that similar products in the marketplace may have different directions_some recommending
use of an emery file and a drop of warm water to prepare the wart site and others not mentioning use of an emery file and
a drop of warm water. The agency believes this situation could lead to consumer confusion. (Although the agency is
aware of only one such marketed product, this does not rule out small volume operations and private label products.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clinical studies (Ref. 1) did not show that using an emery file and a drop of warm water were necessary to prepare
the wart site before application of the medicated plaster. However, these studies also did not show that these procedures
were not necessary, that any adverse effects occurred, or that any interference with the product's safety and effectiveness
occurred when an emery file and a drop of warm water were used. Because the procedure used in the studies included the
use of an emery file and a drop of warm water, the agency has determined that these items should be part of the directions
for this product. The agency is also making a minor format revision in one sentence of the directions. Accordingly,
the agency is proposing to amend the directions in &sect;358.150(d)(3) for 15 percent salicylic acid in a karaya gum,
glycol plaster vehicle, to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

For products containing salicylic acid identified in &sect;358.110(c).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly. Gently
smooth wart surface with emery file supplied.'' (If appropriate: ``Cut plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply a drop of warm
water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry. Apply medicated plaster at bedtime and leave in place for at least
8 hours. In the morning, remove plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed)
for up to 12 weeks.''

The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting
from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.
The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute
a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12866. The agency therefore concludes that
no one of these rules, including this proposed rule amending the final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products,
is a major rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibility
analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities.
However, this particular rulemaking for OTC wart remover drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small
business. The final rule may require some very minor relabeling; however, such relabeling should be a one time nominal
cost. The agency is currently aware of only one such product in the marketplace, and it already has this labeling. Other
manufacturers who may market this product will have 1 year after publication of the final rule to implement this labeling.
The cost to do so will be minimal. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC wart remover drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated
with relabeling or repackaging. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC wart remover drug products
should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that
are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before March 29, 1994, submit written comments on the proposed regulation to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted
on or before March 29, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments and objections are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document
and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of Air Quality Control Region 131. Assuming no other substantive, adverse public
comments are received, the USEPA will proceed with a final approval of the submittal when the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency (MPCA) addresses the concerns detailed in this notice and submits the Administrative Orders to USEPA
before the end of the 30-day comment period. The USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted
by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The revisions are the result of a call for SIP revision
issued by USEPA on December 5, 1984, based on monitored violations. The revisions in the Minnesota submittal are in
the form of non-expiring Findings and Orders for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen
and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company&hyph;Inver Hills Generating Facility.

The promulgation of a Good Engineering Practice stack height rule, along with difficulties negotiating a control
strategy with Koch Refining Company, and the selection of an appropriate computer model, delayed the submittal.
On September 10, 1987, the MPCA submitted revisions to the operating permits for five sources and requested redesignation
to attainment for all of AQCR 131 except the Pine Bend and St. Paul Park areas.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 plan for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131. The submittal consisted of administrative materials demonstrating
that the State had adopted the revision as required and that a public hearing was held. The submittal also contained
administrative orders and technical support for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Plant, Continental
Nitrogen and Resources Corporation, and Northern States Power-Inver Hills Generating Facility. The rest of AQCR
131, including the St. Paul Park Area, are being addressed in separate rulemakings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 16, 1993, USEPA received an amendment to the original administrative order for Koch Refining Company.
The amendment revises the completion dates for construction and operation of a new stack and control equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The attainment demonstration modeling methodology for the sources in the area;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Modeling Methodology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The short-term dispersion modeling was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-term (ISCST version
90346) model. Dispersion modeling for annual impacts was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Long-Term
(ISCLT version 90008) model. All modeling was conducted in accordance with applicable guidance in the ``Guideline
on Air Quality Models (Revised) (1986),'' and ``Supplement A (1987).'' The dispersion modeling reflects USEPA Good
Engineering Practice stack height regulations where applicable. The modeling also incorporated urban dispersion
coefficients using 1973&hyph;1977 Minneapolis/St. Paul hourly surface meteorological data and St. Cloud mixing
height data. These years were used to maintain consistency with the original SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. Although there is no reason to believe the 1973&hyph;1977 meteorological data is not representative of current
meteorological conditions in the Dakota County area, it is suggested that future SIP revision modeling incorporate
the five most recent years of available meteorological data, as is stated in the guidance. Combined SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 impacts resulting from modeling Koch Refinery, Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen Resource Corporation,
and Northern States Power, were calculated at 549 receptors, with model resolution ranging from 1,000 meters near
grid boundaries to 100 meters near hotspot locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Screening modeling was used initially to identify all events with the potential for an exceedance of the Ambient Air
Quality Standards. These critical events were further processed using refined modeling techniques to determine
if the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were protected. Several operating scenarios were modeled. The highest, second-highest predicted concentrations
for the 3-hour and 24-hour averaging times, including background, were 965.1 and 361.6 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, respectively. Annual average impacts were predicted by using a refined modeling approach. The maximum annual predicted
concentration, including background, was 69.1 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional short-term modeling investigated interstate impacts at distances between 10 and 50 km from an MPCA monitor
site. The Wisconsin border is approximately 25 km to the east of the Koch Refinery facility. Modeling was performed
using worst-case emission parameters. The modeling results demonstrated that Dakota County SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions do not prevent attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS in any other State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Statutory Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section is to discuss whether the submittal meets the statutory requirements set forth in the Clean
Air Act. The Pine Bend area of Dakota County, Minnesota is designated nonattainment for the primary NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As a result, SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of subpart 1 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly
section 172(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(1) states that part D plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACM), (e.g., RACT).
The definition of RACT for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS. The Minnesota submittal includes modeling which,
if comments are adequately addressed, demonstrates that the Pine Bend area of Dakota County will achieve attainment
of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented by April 1, 1993. This satisfies the RACM requirements of the Clean
Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress''
is defined in section 171(B)(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emission of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable data.'' The Minnesota submittal provides for attainment of the NAAQS by
April 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the Pine Bend nonattainment area was provided in Appendix D of the submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the submittal be expressly identified
and quantified. The submittal provides for a zero growth margin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source
permitting program for nonattainment areas has been submitted to USEPA by MPCA and is currently undergoing review.
It will be addressed in a separate rulemaking. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program is delegated
to Minnesota and a general permitting rule has been SIP approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. Some enforceability
concerns associated with the submittal are detailed in the next section. If these concerns are adequately addressed,
the limitations will be sufficient to provide for attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of section 110(a)(2). A primary requirement of section 110(a)(2) is that
the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA certifies that a public
hearing was held on May 27, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(8) states that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling
emission inventory and planning procedures. In the Dakota County submittal, no ``equivalent techniques'' were
used for modeling, emission inventory, and planning procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(9) requires the plan to provide for implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area
fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the primary NAAQS by the attainment date applicable under
this part (i.e. contingency measures). In the event of nonattainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Rosemount CNRC facility has three boilers which discharge SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). In addition, the three boilers may not operate at a heat input greater
than that listed in Exhibit 1 of the AO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Company is authorized to burn only natural gas and #6 fuel oil in the three boilers. The Company may not burn #6 fuel
oil with greater than 1.5 percent sulfur by weight. Other restrictions include a limit of no more than 16,000 gallons
of #6 fuel oil per 24-hour period (midnight to midnight), no more than 70,833 gallons of #6 fuel oil per month on a monthly,
12-month rolling average, and the Company cannot burn #6 fuel oil at more than two of the boilers at any one time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through sampling and analyzing the #6 fuel oil for sulfur content
and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods. Also the Company shall measure the total gallons of #6
fuel oil burned at each emission unit. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination
of compliance with the order.

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). None of the limits have an averaging time associated with them. This
leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case, the administrative order
should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to the emission limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative order, Part V.B.2.b.1 &amp; 2, states, in part, that the Company must retain records containing
information on sulfur content and heating value. The administrative order must include a formula to relate this information
to the emission limit in order to determine compliance.

Northern States Power
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are six distillate and residual oil fired gas turbines at the Northern States Power (NSP) facility which discharge
sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. The Company is limited to 1.1 lbs of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/mmBTU from each of the 6 emission units. Also, the Company may not operate the 6 gas turbines at greater than the rated
heat input described in Exhibit 1 of the AO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Company is authorized to burn only distillate and residual fuel oil in each of the gas turbines, and the fuel oil
sulfur content may not exceed 1.0 percent by weight. In addition, the Company may not burn more than 8.75 million gallons
of fuel oil per month on a 12-month rolling average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through either sampling and analyzing the fuel for sulfur
content and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods, or obtaining and retaining a fuel supplier certification.
Also, the Company is to measure the total gallons of fuel oil burned at each emission unit both on a 3-hour basis, and
a monthly, 12-month rolling average basis. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination
of compliance with the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits in the administrative order are written as lbs/mmBTU. None of the limits have an averaging time
associated with them. This leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case,
the administrative order should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to
the emission limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Company is required to keep records on percent sulfur of the fuel, and heating value of the fuel. The administrative
order, Part IV.B.2.a., does not specify a formula which would convert this data to a lbs/mmBTU basis. This is necessary
since the emission limits are in lbs/mmBTU units. A formula is also required in the Annual Reports section of the administrative
order (Part V.B.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part of the demonstration of compliance with emission and operating limits involves obtaining and maintaining a
fuel supplier certification. The administrative order, Part I.D.1.a.4., states that the certification must include
the method used to determine the sulfur content of the fuel oil. It must be made clear that the method used must be an approved
ASTM method as listed in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 19, &sect;5.2.2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AO for Koch Refining includes a compliance schedule for required modifications at various locations around the
facility. Each modification activity is accompanied by completion dates. All of the activities had been completed
at the time the submittal was sent to USEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for the Refinery are listed in the AO and cover the Sulfur Reduction Unit (SRU) 1/2 facility, the
Sulfur Reduction Unit 3 and 4 facility, the Sulfur Reduction Unit 5 facility, the FCC facility emission points 5, 6,
and 8, the Oil Separation and Waste Treatment Plant (OSWTP), the Platformer facility, and the Powerformer facility.

 standard averaging time, 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual. The 3-hour average is based on three consecutive one-hour
periods, the 24-hour is based on 24 consecutive one-hour periods, and the annual is based on a 12-month rolling average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for the Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit (KSAU) facility are listed in Table 3 of the AO and cover Absorber
emission points numbers 1 and 3. However, emission point 1 becomes inoperational when emission point 3 begins operation.
Again, the applicable averaging times are based the same as for the Refinery limits mentioned above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koch Refinery may burn refinery fuel oil, from the refinery fuel oil distribution system, only at select locations.
The fuel oil limits on quantity and sulfur content are specified in Table 2 and Table 2a of the AO. The Refinery may burn
refinery fuel gas at specified locations. The Company may not put fuel gas into the refinery fuel gas distribution
system which contains greater that 0.10 grains of hydrogen sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas. The diesel fuel
used shall not have a sulfur content greater than 0.1 percent by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel restrictions at the KSAU facility limit the Boiler to burning only refinery fuel gas, propane, or commercial
natural gas. The hydrogen sulfide content of refinery fuel gas burned at KSAU cannot exceed 0.10 grains of hydrogen
sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the various limitations and restrictions applied to Koch Refinery are detailed in the AO. The compliance
demonstration include calculations, monitoring, record keeping, diesel fuel certification, and stack tests.
Compliance with the emission limits at KSAU also consist of calculations, monitoring, and data and record keeping.

Compliance for emission points 348, 458, and 459, is to be based on initial stack tests as specified in Table 1, note
#4. Some method needs to be specified for determining future compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative order states in Part V.C.2. that the company shall conduct performance stack tests to determine
compliance with the emission limitations and fuel restrictions outlined in the order as required by the Commissioner.
Stack tests must also be able to be required by appropriate USEPA personnel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131, contained in the Administrative Orders for Koch Refining Company
and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company&hyph;Inver
Hills Generating Facility. However, if the above comments, detailed in this notice, are adequately addressed in
revisions to this plan, and those revisions are submitted to USEPA by the end of the 30-day comment period, then, assuming
no other substantive, adverse public comments are received, USEPA will proceed with a final rulemaking approving
the SIP revision as a whole including the supplemental submittal. If at the end of the 30-day comment period, the issues
are still unresolved, final rulemaking disapproving the SIP revision will be promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments
received by February 28, 1994, will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not
affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in
place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability.
Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies
that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing a public meeting prior to proposing effluent guidelines and standards
for the Metal Products and Machinery category. EPA intends to propose a rule in November 1994, and this is the only public
meeting that the Agency plans to sponsor prior to proposal. The meeting is intended to be a forum in which EPA can report
on the status of regulatory development and in which interested parties can provide information and ideas to the Agency
on key technical, scientific, and other issues.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products (hereinafter referred to as seafood). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures include the monitoring of selected processes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be used by food processors and importers. FDA is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations because a system of preventive controls is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most effective and efficient way to ensure that these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are safe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these proposed regulations is to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory preventive controls to ensure the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products sold commercially in the United States and exported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abroad. These preventive controls will be based on a system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as HACCP. HACCP is a system by which food processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers can evaluate the kinds of hazards that could affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their products, institute controls necessary to keep these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards from occurring, monitor the performance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, and maintain records of this monitoring as a matter of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require that domestic and foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers adopt HACCP controls to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood products for consumers. If these regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted, FDA will review the adequacy of HACCP controls as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its program of mandatory inspections and import examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a review will occur in addition to traditional inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. FDA is also encouraging, but not proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require, that processors and importers adopt the same types of controls for nonsafety hazards relating to economic
adulteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to make HACCP mandatory for the seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Adoption of HACCP controls by the seafood industry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with inspections by FDA based on the HACCP system, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a more effective and more efficient system for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety of seafood products than currently exists. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current inspection system places too great a burden on Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspectors to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address those problems. HACCP places primary responsibility upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry to demonstrate that hazards are understood and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A nationally mandated HACCP system will provide a basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for enhanced consumer confidence in the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Consumers should not be afraid to eat foods, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood, that are recommended as useful lower fat and lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturated fat substitutes for higher fat meats (Ref. 1, p. 13; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ref. 2, p. 21). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The know-how for applying HACCP to seafood is in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advanced state of development. A considerable amount of work on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying HACCP to seafood has already been done by some States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academia, and the Federal Government as well as through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperative activities between the Federal Government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry and through independent industry efforts.

4. Seafood industry representatives have urged the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government to institute a mandatory, HACCP-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection system for their products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A nationally mandated HACCP-type system of controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears to be a prerequisite for continued access to world

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensuring the safety of seafood presents special challenges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to both the industry that produces it and to Government agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged with protecting the public health. Seafood is unique in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many respects. While often thought of as homogeneous in nature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood is actually a variety of products encompassing literally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of species that have little in common other than an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquatic origin. Collectively, seafoods have perhaps the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse and complex microbiology of any food commodity (Ref. 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. xi). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The range of habitats for edible species is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraordinary and diverse ranging from cold to warm water, bottom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dwelling to surface feeding, deep sea to near shore, and fresh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water to saltwater. Fish are exposed to the bacteria and viruses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that naturally occur in their environment as well as to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that enter the water through pollution. Chemicals, some of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are toxic to humans, can accumulate in fish as well. Fish can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also accumulate natural toxins and parasites that are specific to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine animals. As a consequence, fish are subject to a wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of hazards before harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Safety Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The question of how safe is the seafood in the marketplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been the subject of public debate in recent years. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debate has occurred partly because precise data on the numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and causes of foodborne illnesses in the United States do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist. Foodborne illnesses tend to be significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underreported to public health authorities. Data on foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses that are meaningful from an epidemiological standpoint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are difficult and expensive to develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) compiles data in its Foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disease Surveillance System that are reported from State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local health authorities. All foodborne illnesses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underreported to this system (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, CDCP data are the best available and can at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least be used to identify trends and emerging concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various diseases (Ref. 5, p. 219). The data suggest that most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-related illnesses result from certain natural toxins in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finfish and from viruses in molluscan shellfish consumed raw or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partially cooked (Ref. 4). The wide range of other hazards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can affect seafood undoubtedly result in illnesses, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data indicate that such illnesses are not as common. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, according to the CDCP data, the actual occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems tends to be limited relative to the range of hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could cause problems and tends to be associated with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minority of commercially available species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the CDCP system, seafood accounted for 4.8 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported cases of foodborne illness for the period 1973 to 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 4). However, as CDCP has pointed out, variations in rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of underreporting among different foods and varying etiologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it impossible to compare safety among different foods based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely on CDCP data (Ref. 4). This is certainly true for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood. Some seafood-related illnesses tend to be overreported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to CDCP's system relative to other foodborne diseases, due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largely to their distinctive characteristics, while others are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably underreported relative to other causes because they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less distinctive and more difficult to diagnose (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has attempted to determine the relative safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood through risk assessment. The results of this effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that the risk of illness associated with molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked is greater than for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any cooked flesh food. However, seafood overall is as safe or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safer than other flesh foods in terms of frequency of illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 5, p. 25; and 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute of Medicine, in its 1991 report entitled ``Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety,'' are consistent with the CDCP data and the FDA risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment. According to NAS, ``Most seafoods available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. public are wholesome and unlikely to cause illness in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). Moreover, in reviewing the CDCP data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the report noted that the 23 percent increase in seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption in the United States in the 10-year period ending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-borne illnesses (Ref. 7, p. 27). Nevertheless, as NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out, ``there are areas of risk'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report addressed at some length virtually every possible risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could affect seafood and made numerous recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to existing and proposed control measures. NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that improvements be made in the present system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory control (Ref. 7, p. 1) and repeatedly recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP controls wherever appropriate. ``Inspection and testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should focus on actual problems (as in HACCP systems),'' NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded (Ref. 7, p. 16).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. The Principal Hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most notable seafood-related hazards involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because bacteria either naturally live in, or can survive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in, aquatic habitats, there are a large number of pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria that can be found in seafood, particularly molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish. Many of these bacteria are far more harmful to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific human subpopulations, such as the elderly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immunocompromised, or persons with specific underlying diseases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than to the population as a whole. The size of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpopulations is increasing, however. Therefore, concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacterial contamination of seafood, particularly molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, are increasing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the United States, 4.4 percent of botulism outbreaks have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been attributed to seafood. The predominant type of botulism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism in aquatic environments is the kind most readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed by heat. Thus, many types of processing, if done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly, can negate the risk of botulism from seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, with the trend toward greater use of modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere and vacuum packaging (i.e., packaging that excludes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen) to enhance the shelf life and the desirability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated foods, traditional controls need to be enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clostridium botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can grow in the absence of oxygen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other bacteria of concern include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria monocytogenes,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous foodborne microorganism that is ubiquitous in nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is commonly found in food processing environments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is not a marine organism but can contaminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood through improper handling and sanitation practices; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus aureus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 another pathogen associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation and handling (Ref. 8, pp. 14 and 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Viruses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several viruses that are infectious to humans enter aquatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitats through sewage. These viruses can concentrate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish and be present and infective even when bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators of fecal pollution are absent. Viruses probably cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bulk of seafood-associated disease, particularly the Norwalk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Norwalk-like agents, which are linked to the consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated raw or undercooked molluscan shellfish (Ref. 7, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Natural Toxins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Problems associated with naturally occurring toxins in fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been recognized for centuries. Ciguatera poisoning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps the most significant problem associated with a natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin. The toxin is produced by microscopic organisms and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitted to humans through the consumption of finfish that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have eaten these organisms through the food chain (Ref. 7, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
89). The larger, more predacious fish (groupers, snappers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barracuda, amberjack) and reef fish belonging to the crevally or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ulua (Carangidae) family are generally more likely to contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ciguatoxin than other types of fish (Ref. 7, p. 89). Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin is heat stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 9, p. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On average, 70 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually in the United States and its possessions and territories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7, p. 89). Deaths are rare, and the acute symptoms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease are usually of short duration; however, neurological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms can persist for extended periods. Ciguatera is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographically localized, with the majority of illnesses reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from tropical or subtropical areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other toxins of public health concern include domoic acid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was detected in seafood from the U.S. Pacific coast for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first time in the fall and winter of 1991&hyph;1992 (Ref. 10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 1,113); and saxitoxin, or paralytic shellfish poison, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has periodically made molluscan bivalves toxic and has recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected Pacific Northwest crab harvests (Ref. 11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Parasites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parasites, such as anasakid nematodes (round worms), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
naturally infect certain fish and ocean mammals (Ref. 12, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
724). Human parasitic infections almost always occur from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of raw (sushi, sashimi) or undercooked fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, probably no more than five cases are reported on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average in the United States each year and the likelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrence is estimated to be very low (Ref. 5, p. 25). Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with parasites are avoidable through commercial freezing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw fish before consumption.

5. Chemical Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The presence of toxic chemicals in the aquatic environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creates the potential for contamination of seafood products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These chemicals include pesticides; other industrial chemicals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as polychlorinated biphenyls; heavy metals, such as lead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cadmium, and mercury; and petroleum hydrocarbons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marine species, especially deep sea varieties, comprise the majority of seafood consumed in this country. This seafood
has little potential to contain most chemical contaminants at levels of toxicological concern (Ref. 13, p. 6). However,
there are some contaminants that can be present at significant levels, methylmercury in certain species being perhaps
the most notable. Fresh water species, especially nonmigratory bottom feeders, are generally the most exposed to
a variety of chemical contaminants (Ref. 13, p. 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Decomposition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finfish are generally regarded as being much more perishable than terrestrial flesh foods (Ref. 14, p. 3). Decomposition
is a problem with seafood products frequently encountered by FDA and is the subject of the majority of regulatory actions
taken by the agency against violative seafood products (Ref. 15). It is largely an economic and aesthetic problem;
however, in some species it can lead to illness because of the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) during decomposition.
Scombroid poisoning is completely preventable by proper handling, i.e., by proper time and temperature controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Additional Factors Affecting Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unlike beef and poultry, seafood is still predominately a wild-caught flesh food that frequently must be harvested
under difficult conditions and at varying distances from processing, transport, and retail facilities. There are
nearly 100,000 vessels in the U.S. fishing fleet alone (Ref. 7, p. 22). These conditions, distances, and duration
of fishing trips, can tax any system of controls designed to ensure safety and prevent spoilage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several hundred vessels are seagoing processing factories, many of which operate in remote waters.
For regulators, these ships that process at sea can be difficult and expensive to reach while they are operating, and
individual inspectors face hazards such as ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be as many as 350 commercially marketed species (Refs. 16; and 19, p. 35). Consumer preferences for one species
over another and significant price differences between species can lead to economic fraud through the substitution
of cheaper species for more expensive ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike beef and poultry, seafood is subject to significant recreational harvest. Beyond the 15 pounds of seafood
consumed per capita from commercial channels, an additional 4 pounds may be consumed from recreational sources.
Some recreational catch finds its way into commercial channels as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, recreational fishing can have a bearing on the safety of commercial seafood. Commercial fishermen avoid or
are prohibited from harvesting from polluted areas, but recreational fishermen, especially recreational harvesters
of molluscan shellfish, might not be as aware of, or might ignore, local advisories or water closures. Processors
need to be aware of and control the source of their raw materials, and importers must ensure that their shipments are
obtained from acceptable sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional complicating factor in ensuring the safety of seafood is the fact that no other flesh food is imported
in the quantity, or from as many countries, as seafood. Imports include finished products as well as products to be
further processed domestically. Over 55 percent of seafood consumed in this country is imported. It comes from approximately
135 countries. Several of these countries have advance regulatory structures for seafood safety, but many others
are developing nations that lack structures for seafood regulation comparable to those in more developed nations
(Ref. 35, pp. 113 and 114).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is of utmost importance, that those who handle and process seafood commercially, including importers,
understand the hazards associated with this type of food, know which hazards are associated with the types of products
with which they are involved, and keep these hazards from occurring through a routine system of preventive controls.
The seafood industry, indeed, the food industry as a whole, must be primarily responsible for the safety and quality
of the food that it produces. The regulator's primary role should be to verify that the industry is meeting this responsibility
and to take remedial action when it is not. The alternative of relying solely on Government inspectors to identify
problems and provide solutions would involve enormous costs to the public and would be extremely inefficient, assuming
it could be done at all.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the most part, seafood processors and importers are not required, through licensure or examination, to understand
seafood hazards as a prerequisite to being able to do business. (There are exceptions. A few States, such as Alaska,
do require processors to conform to HACCP as a condition of doing business (Ref. 17).) While many processors and importers
have such an understanding, this knowledge is not universal. It is not unusual for FDA to receive inquiries about safety
requirements and related matters from those who wish to process or import seafood, or who already do, that indicate
a lack of awareness of hazards specific to their products. Most of the industry does not have HACCP-trained personnel,
and many firms lack dedicated quality assurance personnel (Ref. 18, p. 35).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seafood processing in the United States is done by several thousand businesses, many of which are small, old, and family
operated (Ref. 19, p. 35). This situation is in contrast to the beef and poultry industries, in which market share is
concentrated among a small number of large processors. Seafood firms tend to be small, fragmented operations sized
in reference to anticipated benefits, because of the significant, uncontrollable risks involved in this business
(Ref. 5, p. 225). Also, because many harvests are seasonal, many of their operations are intermittent (Ref. 20). The
seasonal nature of the industry can affect worker skills and practices relating to safety, while older facilities
and equipment can be more difficult to maintain in terms of adequate sanitation and proper processing and storage
temperatures (Ref. 20).

III. The Need for Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Current Inspection System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seafood processors are subject to periodic, unannounced, mandatory inspection by FDA. Seafood processors and importers
are also able to purchase inspection services from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the U.S. Department
of Commerce. These inspection services have been primarily trade-related, such as grading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until recently, FDA's overall regulatory program for seafood received slightly over $20 million per year. Because
much of the program involves activities such as research, laboratory analyses, and technical assistance and training
to States, a substantial portion of it has tended to be invisible to the general public. Public interest and debate
tends to focus on the more visible aspects of regulation, primarily inspection. The congressional debate of the past
several years over the adequacy of the Federal regulatory program for seafood has been framed, more often than not,
in terms of the need for mandatory inspection. Traditionally, FDA inspected the equivalent of a quarter of its total
domestic inventory of seafood establishments per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1990, however, FDA has received significant funding increases for seafood. The current budget of slightly
over $40 million has permitted the agency to increase the frequency of its inspections. It now inspects so-called
high risk processors at least once per year and all others at least biennially. (Because States also inspect processors,
the collective frequency is actually higher.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even so, because of seafood's unique characteristics (e.g., the fact that it is predominantly wild caught and presents
a wide range of possible hazards), it is questionable whether the current regulatory system, which was developed
for the general food supply, is best suited for the seafood industry. The current system provides the agency with a
``snapshot'' of conditions at a facility at the moment of the inspection. However, assumptions must be made about
conditions before and after that inspection on the basis of the ``snapshot,'' as well as about important factors beyond
the facility that have a bearing on the safety of the finished product. The reliability of these assumptions over the
intervals between inspections creates questions about the adequacy of the system, particularly, as the congressional
hearings on the subject over the past several years have shown, for seafood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's inspections are based upon the regulations on current good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, packing,
or holding human food at part 110 (21 CFR part 110). For the most part, these guidelines consist of broad statements
of general applicability to all food processing on sanitation, facilities, equipment and utensils, processes,
and controls. HACCP-type controls are listed as one of several options available to prevent food contamination (&sect;110.80(b)(13)(i))
but they are otherwise not integral to the guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Federal inspection and surveillance strategies verify the industry's knowledge of hazards and preventive
control measures largely by inference, i.e., whether a company's products are in fact adulterated, or whether conditions
in a plant are consistent with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). Consequently, the current system places
the burden on the Government to prove that a problem exists rather than on the firm to establish for itself, for the regulator,
and for consumers, that adequate controls exist to ensure safety. The current approach is inefficient and, unless
Government inspections are conducted with some frequency, can lead to conditions that can elevate risk and erode
public confidence. It also has the potential to cause some inequities. While the same standards of adulteration apply
to all products in interstate commerce, processors and importers who use a system of preventive controls coupled
with adequate monitoring must compete against those who do not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A survey conducted by FDA in 1992&hyph;1993 of manufacturers of ready-to-eat seafood products revealed conditions
that strongly suggest the need for a system that emphasizes preventive controls to ensure that products are safe by
design. Ready-to-eat products require special care in processing because they do not require, and are unlikely to
receive, any further cooking by consumers that would destroy pathogenic microorganisms. The survey focused on whether
preventive controls exist rather than on the results of expensive end-product sampling. The agency found that, in
significant measure, firms have not been employing the types of preventive processing steps necessary to ensure
a safe and wholesome product. Some of the preliminary results are as follows (Ref. 21).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Fifty-four percent of the firms that pasteurized products had not established the adequacy of their pasteurization
process to destroy pathogenic microorganisms such as the spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E, which can cause significant illness and death in humans. The pasteurization process is not simple and must
be done with precision in order to consistently deliver a thermal process that will inactivate the spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E and prevent recontamination of the product after it has been heat treated. The CGMP at part 110 state that pasteurization
must be adequate. Realistically, the only way for FDA to determine, or at least infer, the adequacy of the process now
is to analyze samples of finished product for the presence of pathogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Twenty-seven percent of the firms that pasteurized products did not have temperature-indicating devices on their
pasteurizers, and 35 percent did not have temperature-recording devices. Temperature monitoring is essential
to ensure that a thermal process is properly controlled. Part 110 addresses temperature indicating and recording
devices only for refrigeration, while pasteurization involves cooking. A temperature-recording device is important
for purposes of preventive control because it provides a continuous history of the cooking step.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Forty-two percent of firms that pasteurized products did not perform can seam evaluations or performed them less
frequently than every 12 hours. Such evaluations are necessary to ensure that there will not be microbiological contamination
of the finished pasteurized product. FDA's regulations for the processing of low acid canned food (parts 108 and 113
(21 CFR parts 108 and 113)) require such evaluations every 4 hours as an HACCP-type control, but products that need
refrigeration (e.g., pasteurized products) are outside the scope of those regulations. Again, part 110 states only
that the pasteurization process should be adequate. FDA must conduct end-product sampling and analysis to determine,
or at least infer, whether a pasteurization process is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Forty-three percent of firms that pasteurized products did not perform cooling water sanitizer strength checks
to ensure that the pasteurized product would not be contaminated during this process. The presence of a sanitizer
in the cooling water is important to prevent contamination of the product after pasteurization because during cooling,
some water can be drawn into hot cans. Part 110 does not specifically mention a cooling water sanitizer. The ``adequate''
provision cited above is the closest relevant provision, and FDA must conduct end-product sampling and analysis
to determine, or at least infer, whether a pasteurization process is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Eighty-four percent of the firms did not monitor the internal temperature of products during the various stages
of processing. Such monitoring is important because time/temperature abuse can result in the growth of pathogenic
microorganisms, decomposition, and, in some cases, the formation of histamine. Part 110 states that all reasonable
precautions should be taken to prevent contamination and recommends temperature control as one type of precaution.
Again, end-product sampling is the only practical way for FDA to measure compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fourteen percent of the firms did not have temperature-indicating devices on their finished product coolers,
and 89 percent did not have temperature-recording devices. Part 110 states that processors should have one or the
other but does not specifically require that processors monitor either one. While 14 percent were out of compliance,
most who were in compliance opted for the control that did not provide a continuous record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Thirty-one percent of the temperature-indicating devices on finished product coolers were more than 5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F out of adjustment. Fifty-five percent of these were giving readings that were too low. For these, the deviation
would permit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, decomposition, and histamine formation. Part 110 specifically
states that thermometers should be accurate. Five degree deviations are clearly out of compliance. A significant
percentage of firms surveyed were not paying attention to a significant preventive control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Twenty-three percent of temperature-indicating devices on pasteurizers and 80 percent of such devices on finished
product coolers were never calibrated. Again, part 110 calls for accuracy. The failure to calibrate means that these
firms have no assurance that their devices are accurate. A preventive control is not being applied, and thus a significant
percentage of processors are apparently relying on Government investigators to determine accuracy during inspections.
Also, this deficiency may account in part for the deviations described in section III.A.7. of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Twenty-nine percent of temperature-recording devices on finished product coolers were never checked for accuracy,
while 34 percent of such devices on pasteurizers and 74 percent on finished product coolers were checked less frequently
than once a month. Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred out of calibration and must be routinely adjusted
to agree with an accurate temperature-indicating device. Thus, they need to be checked for accuracy at least at the
start and the end of each processing day in order to determine whether they remained accurate throughout the day's
production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Forty-eight percent of the firms cleaned and sanitized the processing equipment less frequently than every 4
hours, while 13 percent cleaned and sanitized less than every 12 hours. Part 110 states that sanitation practices
should occur as frequently as necessary. In order to control salmonella and other undesirable bacteria within a facility,
the frequency should be at least every 4 hours, and more frequently if feasible. This frequency helps reduce the likelihood
that these microorganisms will enter a rapid phase of growth during which their numbers increase logarithmically
(Ref. 22, p. 114; Ref. 23, p. 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Twenty-two percent of the firms did not perform plant or equipment sanitation audits (i.e., inspections), and
35 percent did not check the strength of hand or equipment sanitizing solutions. These results reveal that a significant
number of plants are not checking up on themselves to ensure that they were doing an adequate job of sanitation. In such
plants, the only check on sanitation is provided by the Government investigators who visit the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other survey and inspection findings by FDA and others strongly indicate that the seafood industry does not always
operate on the basis of preventive controls. For example, recent FDA and State surveys showed that many processors
of smoked and smoke-flavored fish are operating outside of the parameters that have been demonstrated through scientific
research to be necessary to ensure that the hazard from botulism is adequately controlled. These parameters are process
times and temperatures and salinity levels. A number of firms surveyed did not even know their own operating parameters,
let alone the scientifically established ones (Refs. 24, 25, and 26). For seafood products such as these that require
no cooking by the consumer, preventive measures by the processor to eliminate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E to the maximum extent possible are critically important.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Alternatives Other Than HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continuous visual inspection of seafood is not a viable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative. Few hazards associated with seafood are detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through visual inspection. Moreover, the costs of such a system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would likely exceed the nearly half-billion-dollar public outlay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now required to operate this kind of system for meat and poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative would be to direct significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional resources toward greatly increasing the frequency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's inspection of seafood, as well as increasing the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling, laboratory analysis, and related regulatory activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to seafood. While thousands of samples of domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and imported seafood products are collected each year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in FDA laboratories, and these samples are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically designed to represent a broad range of products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are generally perceived by the public to represent only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small fraction of the total poundage of seafood consumed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. Substantial new expenditures would be needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase laboratory analyses to nationally statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the funds for increased inspection and increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling and analysis were available (which they are not), this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach alone would likely not be the best way for the agency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spend its money to protect the public health. Reliance on end-product testing involves a certain amount of inefficiency
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can require very large sample sizes to overcome. NAS recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed that ``the statistical uncertainties associated with lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling make this an unreliable method for ensuring safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food products *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 7, p. 283). FDA has traditionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sought to minimize this type of inefficiency by targeting its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts based on its experiences, but some inefficiency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unavoidable. NAS recommended the HACCP system as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7, p. 283). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Current Import System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar considerations apply to imports. FDA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally inspect processing facilities in other countries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether seafood products are being prepared, packed, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held there under appropriate conditions. Such inspections are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely costly and require an invitation from the foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. Traditionally, therefore, FDA's primary strategy for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood imports has involved: (1) Reviewing all customs entries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents to determine which imported products to examine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample; (2) conducting wharf examinations of selected products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on that review; and (3) sampling and laboratory analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One concern about this process that has been voiced with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some regularity in the media, Congress, and elsewhere is that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically looks at less than 5 percent of all imports. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure is somewhat misleading because it refers to seafood lots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can vary substantially in size. Also, it does not take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account such factors as the representative nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations, FDA's automatic detention program for imports that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires importers of products with a history of problems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain a laboratory analysis and certification prior to entry, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that imports receiving further processing in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States become subject to domestic inspection. Nonetheless, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certainly true that most imported seafood is not physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampled or examined by a Federal health official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total number of customs entries for seafood each year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaching 200,000 (Ref. 27) from about 135 countries (compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to about 33 countries for beef and poultry (Ref. 28)), and huge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sums of money would be needed to enable FDA to increase its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical examination and sampling program to nationally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant levels. Still, many developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countries export seafood products to this country, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory protections tend to be comparatively weak, if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist at all. Processing conditions in such countries do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always meet U.S. standards for sanitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While many importers are conscientious about the safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the products that they import, others have little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding of potential hazards. The denial of entry of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violative lot may be regarded as simply a cost of doing business, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is offset in many cases by insurance purchased against just 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such an eventuality. Such policies are identified as ```FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejection' insurance'' and usually the premium is 2 to 3 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the value of the shipment (Ref. 29). It is reasonable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume that this cost is being passed on to the consumer. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance also permits importers to buy seafood from foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors without first ensuring that it meets FDA requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., that it is safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system leaves much to be desired. It, too, is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``snapshot''-type approach that places a significant burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government to uncover problems without fostering or promoting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry responsibility. It lacks the preventive controls that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency has tentatively concluded are the minimum necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure safety. Moreover, it has not provided full public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence in the safety of imported seafood.

D. Public Confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continuing public concerns about the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide additional evidence that the current regulatory system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not well-suited for seafood. Consumers have become increasingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned about the effects of pollution on seafood. Medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes washing up on beaches, ocean dumping of toxic wastes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical run-off, and multiple oil spills continually dramatize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that bodies of water, no matter how large, can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affected by human activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Media and other public attention on seafood safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality, and on the adequacy of the current regulatory program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for seafood, has been substantial in recent years, and there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no reason to expect that this attention will decrease. Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with some seafood products draw attention to, and has tended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raise concerns about, all seafood, a situation that is bad for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers because seafood is a low fat product, and bad for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry that can ill afford it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several hearings on the sufficiency and direction of the Federal seafood safety program have been held in both houses
of Congress since in 1989. In addition, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress for the stated purpose of establishing
a Federal program of mandatory inspection of seafood. Different bills passed the House and the Senate in 1990 but were
not reconciled before the end of the 101st Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This legislative activity has tended to reinforce the view that the public is placed at some risk because no Federal
mandatory program for seafood exists. While this view is inaccurate in a number of respects, it is fueled in part by
the notable differences in the frequency with which regulatory agencies inspect the processors of different types
of flesh foods. As stated above, beef and poultry slaughterhouses are subject to continuous visual inspection under
programs operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public concerns about seafood regulation persist despite the recent increases in Federal resources and inspections
for seafood. A major U.S. newspaper recently published an article entitled ``A Sea of Uncertainties,'' which expressed
anxiety about the coverage of seafood inspection. ``The odds are,'' it observed, ``that the bit of fish you cook tonight
got to your table without ever being poked or prodded or even glanced at by a government inspector'' (Ref. 30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No realistic system, however, could possibly look at every piece of fish. Moreover, in the current budget climate,
improvements in the system for ensuring the safety of seafood will likely have to be qualitative rather than quantitative.
Estimated combined Federal, State, and local outlays for regulatory activities relating to seafood are about $100
million annually (Ref. 31), but pressures to cut back funding exist at all of these levels.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the Government must find new approaches to food safety that enable it to become more efficient and minimize costs
wherever possible. A new paradigm is needed for seafood inspection, one that provides an ongoing, scientifically
established system of intensive, preventive monitoring but that does not require undue resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

One of the key challenges will be to endure the scrutiny of the informed consumer and demanding marketplace *&blank;*&blank;*.
The Canadian Government, as well as other western governments will be under constant pressure to limit spending as
the aging population places more and more demands on services and as the Federal deficit is addressed. This means inspection
programs cannot expect to have ever increasing resources to meet the challenges of the 1990's. Smarter and more cost
effective ways must be developed to carry out their mandate.

A. What is HACCP? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control. Its application to food production was pioneered by the Pillsbury
Company (Pillsbury) during that company's efforts in the early 1960's to create food for the U.S. space program. Pillsbury
concluded that then existing quality control techniques could not provide adequate assurance that the food being
produced was not contaminated. The end-product testing necessary to provide such assurance would be so extensive
that little food would be left for space flights. According to Howard E. Bauman: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We concluded after extensive evaluation that the only way we could succeed would be to develop a preventive system.
This would require us to have control over the raw materials, process, environment, personnel, storage, and distribution
as early in the system as we possibly could. We felt certain that if we could establish this type of control, along with
appropriate record keeping, we should be able to produce *&blank;*&blank;* a product we could say was safe. For all
practical purposes, if this system was implemented correctly, there would be no testing of the finished packaged
product other than for monitoring purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the succeeding years, the system devised by Pillsbury has been recognized worldwide as an effective system of controls.
The system has undergone considerable analysis, refinement, and testing. FDA believes that HACCP concepts have
matured to the point where they can be formally implemented for seafood on an industry wide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP consists first of an identification of the likely hazards that could be presented by a specific product, followed
by the identification of the critical control points in a specific production process where a failure would likely
result in a hazard being created or allowed to persist. These critical control points are then systematically monitored,
and records are kept of that monitoring. Corrective actions are also documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), which was established by USDA in
conjunction with FDA at the recommendation of NAS, has developed seven widely accepted HACCP principles that explain
this process in greater detail (Ref. 34). These HACCP principles follow.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Hazard Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first step in the establishment of an HACCP system for a food process is the identification of the hazards associated
with the product. NACMCF defined a hazard as a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be
unsafe for consumption (Ref. 34, p. 186). The hazard analysis step should include an assessment of both the likelihood
that these hazards will occur and their severity if they do occur. It should also involve the establishment of preventive
measures to control them. To be addressed by the HACCP system, the hazards must be such, according to NACMCF, that their
prevention, elimination, or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of a safe food. Even factors
beyond the immediate control of the processor, such as how the food will be distributed and how it will be consumed,
must be considered because these factors could influence how it should be processed. Hazards that involve low risk
and that are not likely to occur need not be considered for purposes of HACCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACMCF has developed numerous issues to be considered during hazard analysis. These issues relate to matters such
as ingredients, processing, distribution, and the ultimate intended use of the product. FDA urges seafood processors
and importers to become familiar with these issues. They include, for example, whether a food contains any sensitive
ingredients that may present microbiological hazards, chemical hazards, or physical hazards; whether sanitation
practices can affect the safety of the food that is being processed; and whether the finished food will be heated by
the consumer. For seafood, this analysis is particularly important because it is consumed raw or partially cooked
to an extent unrivaled for other flesh foods. Examples of seafoods that are consumed in this way include raw molluscan
shellfish, sushi, steamed clams, and cold smoked salmon.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Identify the Critical Control Points in the Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Points in a manufacturing process that may be critical control points, as listed by the NACMCF, include cooking, chilling,
specific sanitation procedures, product formulation control, prevention of cross contamination, and certain
aspects of employee and environmental hygiene. For example, a cooking step that must be operated at a specific temperature
and for a specified time in order to destroy microbiological pathogens is a critical control point. Likewise, refrigeration
required to prevent hazardous microorganisms from multiplying or toxins from forming is a critical control point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Establish Critical Limits for Preventive Measures Associated With Each Identified Critical Control Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In essence, this step involves establishing a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with
a critical control point. Critical limits can be thought of as boundaries of safety for each critical control point
and may be set for preventive measures such as temperature, time, physical dimensions, moisture level, water activity,
Ph, available chlorine, or sensory information such as texture, aroma, or visual appearance. Critical limits may
be derived from sources such as regulatory standards and guidelines, literature surveys, experimental studies,
and experts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Establish Procedures To Monitor Critical Control Points
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monitoring is a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a critical control point is under
control and to produce an accurate record for future use in verification. NACMCF identifies three main purposes for
monitoring: (1) It tracks the system's operation so that a trend toward a loss of control can be recognized, and corrective
action can be taken to bring the process back into control before a deviation occurs; (2) it indicates when loss of control
and a deviation has actually occurred, and corrective action must be taken; and (3) it provides written documentation
for use in verification of the HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As NACMCF points out, continuous monitoring is possible with many types of physical and chemical methods. For example,
temperature and time for a scheduled thermal process can be recorded continuously on temperature-recording charts.
When it is not possible to monitor a critical limit on a continuous basis, monitoring intervals must be reliable enough
to permit the manufacturer to determine whether the hazard is under control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Establish the Corrective Action To Be Taken When Monitoring Shows That a Critical Limit Has Been Exceeded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the HACCP system is intended to prevent deviations in a planned process from occurring, perfection is rarely,
if ever, achievable. Thus, NACMCF states that there must be a corrective action plan in place to: (1) Determine the
disposition of any food that was produced when a deviation was occurring; (2) fix or correct the cause of noncompliance
to ensure that the critical control point is under control; and (3) maintain records of corrective actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Establish Effective Recordkeeping Systems That Document the HACCP System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This principle requires the preparation and maintenance of a written HACCP plan that sets out the hazards, critical
control points, and critical limits identified by the firm, as well as the monitoring, recordkeeping, and other procedures
that the firm intends to take to implement the plan. Secondly, this principle requires the maintenance of records
generated during the operation of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimately, it is the recordkeeping associated with HACCP procedures that makes the system work, both from the standpoint
of the HACCP operator (industry) and the regulator. One conclusion in a study of HACCP performed by the Department
of Commerce is that correcting problems without recordkeeping almost guarantees that problems will reoccur (Ref.
35, p. 85). The requirement to record events at critical control points on a regular basis ensures that preventive
monitoring is occurring in a systematic way.

7. Establish Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System Is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This process involves: (1) Verifying that the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits are adequate to control the hazards; (2) ensuring that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plan is working properly, e.g., that it is being followed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that appropriate decisions are being made about corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions; and (3) ensuring that there is documented, periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revalidation of the plan to make sure that it is still relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to raw materials as well as to conditions and processes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant. Government regulatory activities also help ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HACCP system is working. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Specific Applications to Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As NAS has pointed out, most health risks associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood originate in the environment (Ref. 7, p. 1). Many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these risks are the subject of research by FDA, the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others. This research is designed both to produce information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will provide a better understanding of the toxins, bacteria, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical contaminants, and other phenomena and to provide a basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for developing more advanced types of controls for them. Within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the limits of existing scientific knowledge, however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry can and should use HACCP to control the source and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of raw materials based on an understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely hazards that need to be prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pillsbury team that first applied HACCP to food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production began with a systematic review of raw materials to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that they were not bringing hazards into the plant. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bauman pointed out: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This required the development of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarity with the raw materials that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a normal process in food product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development *&blank;*&blank;*. The areas of concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranged from the potential presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens, heavy metals, toxins, physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards and chemicals, to the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatments the ingredients might have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received such as pesticide applications or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization step. (Ref. 33, pp. 2 and 3.) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While all these areas that were of concern to Pillsbury are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
germane to all seafoods, they certainly cover the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards to which seafoods are susceptible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the three most frequently reported seafood-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses, two are environmentally related: ciguatera in warm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water reef fish, as described previously, and water-borne viruses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in molluscan shellfish consumed raw and partially cooked. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rapid test to detect ciguatoxin in fish continues to be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target of research at FDA and elsewhere, processors and importers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can exercise control by ensuring that they are obtaining fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from responsible sources that are not harvesting from waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where ciguatoxin is being found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ciguatera has been associated with recreational fishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processors and importers should address through HACCP any safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations that might exist with the commercial sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational catch generally, depending upon species and locale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For viruses from molluscan shellfish to be controlled, HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures must be in place to ensure that molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested from polluted waters are not entering commerce. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key safety controls relate to proper refrigeration to keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially harmful microbes from reaching dangerous levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third seafood-related illness, scombroid poisoning, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by a toxin created as part of the process of decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after a fish has died. The formation of scombrotoxin can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triggered by time/temperature abuse anywhere in the commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and beyond, including as early as on the harvesting vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if good handling controls are not followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is considering whether to develop good handling practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (not necessarily HACCP) specific to fishing vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and invites comment on this matter. FDA has traditionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels, largely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the huge number of such vessels in the U.S. fleet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even though it has authority to do so. FDA invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether those boats that harvest scombrotoxin-forming species, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other specific component of the fleet, should be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory HACCP controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Meanwhile, processors and importers of scombrotoxin-forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species can exercise HACCP controls aimed at ensuring that their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incoming raw materials or imported shipments have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature abused. Because any HACCP plans for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors or importers would be clearly inadequate if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin were not identified as a hazard and appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls were not in place and systematically monitored, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers should consider placing time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on vessel owners as a prerequisite to doing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP can also be applied to control of hazards from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical contaminants, even though the full range of possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical hazards is still imperfectly understood. Government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academia have important roles to play in researching the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicities of these chemicals, in monitoring them, and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing various forms of risk assessment. In some cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these efforts may result in the establishment of national maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits. In other cases, regional advisories may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. The seafood industry has a responsibility to know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether chemical hazards are associated with the species they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling, whether the occurrence of such hazards depends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest site or other factors, and whether a sampling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis program on their part would be appropriate. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers should monitor the origin of raw materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported shipments to ensure, for example, that harvest did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in locations subject to public health advisories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are but a few examples of environmentally related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards to which HACCP can be applied. HACCP controls can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that hazards are not being created inside a processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility through improper handling, cooking, or storing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Regulatory Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From a regulatory standpoint, inspections of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and of importers' plans and records would become more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient and would be likely to have a much greater impact if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP controls were in place. A key feature of an inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system tied to implementation of HACCP is access by Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators to the HACCP plan and to monitoring records kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under that plan. In contrast to the ``snapshot'' provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current inspections, examination of HACCP records will enable an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigator to see how the processing facility or the importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operates over time. It will enable an investigator to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether problems have occurred, and how they were addressed. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will also enable an investigator to spot trends that could lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to problems, and thus to help prevent them from occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it will enable the regulator to review the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the processor's or importer's preventive control system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself. Under such an inspection system, inadequate preventive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls would warrant remedial or regulatory action regardless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of whether the processor's or importer's product is actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated or unsafe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP is not a zero risk system, however. Problems in food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production and processing will still occur. HACCP systems are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to detect and document those problems, so that they can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be corrected as quickly as possible. Thus, regulatory action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be warranted on the basis of the mere occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing problems. It would be warranted, though, if the HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is not functioning properly to detect and correct the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems, or if adulterated food is allowed to enter into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An inspection program tied to mandatory industry adoption of the HACCP system would not be industry self-certification,
nor would it be deregulatory. An investigator under such a program would perform HACCP reviews but not to the exclusion
of other inspection activities. Thus, it is highly doubtful whether any falsification of records would go undetected.
Investigators are taught to recognize falsification of records, and the inspection techniques they use would likely
reveal any instances in which the records do not reflect actual conditions and practices. Falsification of records
carries strict penalties under Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the other inspection options discussed previously that would involve continuous or high-frequency inspection
and commensurate costs, an inspection system tied to HACCP would not necessarily require an increase over current
inspection frequencies. Recordkeeping and record inspection will provide the inspector, however, with a broader
view. Moreover, to the extent that States adopt equivalent inspection programs in response to these proposed regulations,
the resultant network of consistent inspections would, in effect, increase the frequency of inspections at no additional
cost. The value to the nation of such a network would be substantial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that many States are under considerable pressure to cut back funding in areas where a Federal presence
also exists. For seafood, however, FDA urges that the States maintain their programs, strengthen them to the extent
possible, and work with the agency to integrate them into a HACCP-based, Federal/State network. Such an approach
would be consistent with recommendations relating to the role of States made by NAS in its 1991 report on seafood safety
(Ref. 7, p. 16). FDA especially invites comment on how the proposed FDA program should mesh with an existing State HACCP
program for seafood, such as the program that exists in Alaska, so that inconsistent Federal and State HACCP requirements

V. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Decision To Propose To Make Use of HACCP Mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the foregoing reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that a new system of regulatory controls for seafood is necessary,
and that HACCP is the appropriate system. Therefore, FDA is proposing to add part 123 to establish procedures for the
safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products. FDA is proposing these procedures under sections 402(a)(1),
402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1), 342(a)(4), and 371(a)),
in conjunction with section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 264). Section 402(a)(1) of
the act states that food is adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render
it injurious to health. Section 402(a)(4) of the act was included in the act to provide additional control over insanitary
and contaminated foods. (H.R. Rept. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d sess. 6 (1938).) Section 701(a) of the act authorizes
the agency to adopt regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. Section 361 of the PHS Act authorizes the
agency to adopt regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations set out those requirements that the agency tentatively has concluded are the minimum necessary
to ensure that, to the extent possible, the processing and importation of fish and fishery products will not result
in a product that is injurious to health. These requirements include the establishment of HACCP preventive controls
that take into account the unique characteristics of seafood products. If a processor or an importer fails to adopt
and implement an HACCP plan that complies with the requirements that FDA is proposing, or otherwise fails to operate
in accordance with these proposed provisions, it will be preparing, packing, or holding the food under insanitary
conditions under which the food may be rendered injurious to health. Thus the food will be adulterated under section
402(a)(4) of the act and subject to regulatory action by FDA. The agency has reflected this fact in proposed &sect;123.6(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's tentative decision to adopt regulations that require the implementation of HACCP principles by the seafood
industry is grounded in the statutory objective of preventing food safety and sanitation problems. Section 402(a)(4)
of the act does not require that FDA demonstrate that food is actually hazardous or contaminated in order to deem the
food adulterated and to exclude it from commerce. Instead, under section 402(a)(4) of the act, food producers must
assure that the food is not ``prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may have been
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contaminated with filth, or whereby it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may have been
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rendered injurious to health.'' [emphasis added.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In enforcing section 402(a)(4) of the act, FDA has considered, among other things, prevailing industry standards
and the technical state-of-the-art in determining on a case-by-case basis whether the conditions under which a company
is processing or handling food satisfy section 402(a)(4) of the act. This proposed regulation would codify an appropriate
state-of-the-art means of assuring seafood safety and of preventing sanitation problems under FDA's authority
to promulgate regulations for the ``efficient enforcement'' of the act (section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a))).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The factual record that FDA has developed concerning the safety and sanitation issues posed by seafood illustrates
the need for codifying appropriate preventive methods consistent with the emerging technical state-of-the-art
and explains why FDA's initial focus in implementing HACCP is on seafood. Proof that any particular process or set
of manufacturing conditions in the production of seafood has in fact caused injuries or sanitation problems is not,
however, a legal prerequisite to this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed adoption of this rule is supported by several additional factors. First, as stated above, the application
of HACCP to the seafood industry has been the subject of a substantial amount of work, by the Federal government, some
States, academia, and the seafood industry itself, to develop specific HACCP models and otherwise to apply HACCP
to seafood processing and importation. The Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP) was conducted by NOAA at the
request of Congress in 1986 to design an inspection system for seafood consistent with HACCP principles. This project
resulted in the development of 16 regulatory models for specific seafood products that describe the basis for a mandatory
seafood inspection system. Each model applies many of the NACMCF principles described above in the context of a specific
product, such as breaded shrimp, raw fish, and molluscan shellfish (Ref. 35, pp. 67 to 73). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MSSP was conducted with significant industry involvement. The importance of industry participation in the development
of HACCP systems was stressed by NAS in its 1985 study of HACCP (Ref. 36, pp. 13, 309, and 310). As part of the MSSP project,
49 workshops were conducted involving 1,200 industry, State, and university participants. HACCP controls were
considered for economic fraud and plant sanitation/hygiene as well as for safety because economic fraud and sanitation
have been problems in the seafood industry. The MSSP models cover nearly all the types of seafood products consumed
in the United States except for low acid canned seafood, which is already subject to a mandatory HACCP control and inspection
system under the low acid canned food regulations adopted by FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low acid canned seafood products represent about 25 percent of all seafoods consumed in the United States (Ref. 7,
p. 23). The regulatory system in place for them represents the first formal application of HACCP principles to food
by a regulatory agency. As with this proposal, the regulations for low acid canned foods were requested by industry,
and they were developed through cooperation between Government and industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the low acid canned food regulations apply HACCP concepts to two hazards only, i.e., botulism in canned foods
and contamination because of poor container integrity, they are regarded as a major success and demonstrate the benefits
that HACCP can provide. Botulism in canned goods has been effectively controlled under the low acid canned food regulations
and is no longer a particular source of consumer concern. NAS recently concluded that canned fish is among the safest
of seafood items. (Ref. 7, p. 320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seafood industry associations have been active in developing HACCP systems that their members could use. For the
past several years, the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) has been assisting firms in the northeast
to implement HACCP systems through Federal grants. NEFDA's activities include a pilot project for 15 processing
firms and participation in a retail seafood HACCP pilot (Ref. 18, p. 26). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Academia has been active as well. For example, the Oregon Sea Grant, which services the Oregon marine community as
part of the national Sea Grant extension service, has issued a publication, ``Hazard Analysis &amp; Critical Control
Point Applications to the Seafood Industry'' (Ref. 37). This publication explains the fundamentals of HACCP, inventories
microbial hazards of seafoods, and describes model HACCP systems for specific types of seafood processing operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of efforts like these by Government, industry, and academia, a considerable amount of literature and expertise
now exist to facilitate the development of HACCP systems by seafood processors and importers, significantly more
than for most other major segments of the food industry. Given the advanced state of knowledge about the application
of HACCP to the seafood industry, FDA is proposing to make the use of HACCP mandatory for the seafood industry to ensure
that there is compliance with section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, seafood industry representatives have been urging the Federal Government to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based
system for years. The National Fisheries Institute, the largest seafood industry trade association, and others
from the seafood industry testified repeatedly at congressional hearings from 1989 through 1992 in support of legislation
that would mandate such a system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, nearly all of the seafood bills introduced in the Congress since the late 1980's, including the bills that
passed both chambers in 1990, contained HACCP elements. While there were different views on the merits of these legislative
proposals, virtually all Government agencies, both Federal and State, that testified on these proposals_as well
as most other witnesses_expressed support for the HACCP concept as it applies to seafood. The Chairman of the Interstate
Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC), an organization of States, Federal agencies, and industry that considers
issues relating to molluscan shellfish safety, testified that a HACCP-type approach is now being used for aspects
of the shellfish program and endorsed HACCP for all seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant elements of the seafood industry continue to press for the Federal Government to institute a HACCP-based
program. An article in a 1992 edition of a seafood trade publication on the advantages of HACCP concluded: ``With the
seafood industry under a continuing barrage of negative press regarding the wholesomeness and safety of product,
the industry is impatient to get started with a seafood inspection program that will reassure consumers *&blank;*&blank;*''
(Ref. 19, p. 39). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February, 1993, the Executive Vice President of the National Fisheries Institute wrote to the Secretary of Health
and Human Services asking that she ``initiate a state-of-the-art program for seafood which would be of significant
benefit to consumers * * *. HACCP-based regulation is very feasible for the seafood industry * * *. There is no reason
to wait for congressional action to put this modern technology in place'' (Ref. 38). As recently as April, 1993, the
President of the Pacific Seafood Processors wrote to FDA expressing support for a mandatory seafood HACCP program
(Ref. 39). The members of that organization process the majority of domestically harvested seafood. These requests
provide further evidence of the appropriateness of this proposal.

B. Preparing for HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that this proposal involves a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departure from current practices for most processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers and intends to work cooperatively with the industry in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the establishment of this proposed system. The agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences under both its HACCP-based low acid canned food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and the HACCP-based pilot programs for seafood that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it conducted with NOAA in 1991 demonstrate the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperation and technical support between the agency and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry in order to establish HACCP and to make it work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA/NOAA joint pilot programs involved the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and implementation of HACCP-based systems by seafood processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and HACCP-based inspections by the two agencies. Even though the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA/NOAA pilots involved highly motivated seafood firms that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volunteered to adopt HACCP, the firms found it difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially to identify hazards and critical control points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with their own products and processes (Ref. 40). As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both the agencies and the firms discovered, HACCP involved new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways of thinking and behaving that were not readily understood or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented. A considerable amount of consultation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance between the firms and the Government proved to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely helpful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This experience reinforces the view that regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose a HACCP-based system are needed for the seafood industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus represents a third factor supporting the appropriateness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this proposal. The systematic kind of preventive thinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HACCP requires is not universal, but it can be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations will ensure that processors and importers do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significantly, once participants in the pilot programs made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition to HACCP, they were able to identify benefits from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using HACCP to themselves and to consumers in terms of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and quality, as well as plant sanitation and organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 40). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. International Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although not a public health issue, international trade is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also a major consideration in determining the advisability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of a new system of seafood regulation and therefore will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be addressed here. It is estimated that close to 40 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish and shellfish harvested from the world's oceans, lakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other bodies of water entered international trade in 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 41). This movement reflects the need to match supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with demand. Nations often have species in their waters for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which there is little or no demand among their consumers, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers in other countries may prefer these species. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, sometimes foreign markets are willing to pay higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices than domestic markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation in the international trade in seafood is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical to U.S. consumers and industry. Approximately 55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the U.S. supply of edible seafood is imported. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991, 3,014,819,000 pounds were imported, worth $5,617,887,000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making the United States the world's second largest seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing nation (Ref. 42).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the United States is the world's largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exporter of fishery products. In 1991, the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exported more than $3 billion worth of seafood, making a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant positive contribution to this country's balance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments as well as to the many coastal State economies in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products are produced (Refs. 42 and 43). Our largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market is Japan, followed by the European Community (EC) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada. Both Canada and the EC have implemented or are in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of implementing mandatory HACCP-based seafood inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems (Refs. 32 and 44). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the significance of both international and domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade, ongoing efforts to harmonize or make equivalent country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection systems and requirements takes on great significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current multilateral round of trade negotiations under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further focus on this area. The draft text on sanitary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phytosanitary measures acknowledges the desire of the contracting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties, including the United States, to support ``the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracting parties, on the basis of international standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines, and recommendations developed by the relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international organizations including the Codex Alimentarious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 45, p. L.35). This move toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonization, coupled with the current recommendations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Codex Committee on Food Hygiene encouraging the international use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HACCP system (Ref. 46), clearly argue for the adoption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach in the United States for seafood. Failure by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may ultimately undermine its export success, with considerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic consequences. For example, in addition to the EC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada, Iceland, Australia, and many other fishing nations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved to a mandatory HACCP approach that could affect United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States competitiveness in the major seafood markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EC is the United States' second largest export market, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing $441 million worth of U.S. products in 1991. On July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, 1991, EC Council Directive 91/493 was issued to set out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for the production and placing on the EC market fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fishery products (Ref. 44). This Directive requires, as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1993, that both member States and third countries:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* take all necessary measures so that, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all stages of the production of fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products *&blank;*&blank;* persons responsible must carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out their own checks based on the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_Identification of critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points in their establishments on the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the manufacturing processes used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_establishment and implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for monitoring and checking such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points; *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_keeping a written record *&blank;*&blank;* with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a view to submitting them to the competent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the directive provides some flexibility in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalence, it is clear that the EC is looking for a mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system along the lines proposed in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintaining and expanding this export market is likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitated if this proposal is adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, ongoing discussions with Canada under the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of section 708 of the U.S./Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonize or make equivalent the two nations' respective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection systems and standards have made it clear that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed HACCP regulation will significantly facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process (Ref. 47). Canada has recently completed implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a mandatory, HACCP-based seafood inspection program. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada is the United States' third largest export market and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest supplier of imported seafood, adoption of an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system would not only achieve the objectives of the FTA but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially would save resources currently devoted to monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments between our two countries. Similar potential benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be expected under the proposed North American FTA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly at this formative stage in that process. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitation of international trade is a fourth factor supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriateness, and thus providing a rational basis, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's proposed course of action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. The Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations consist of a subpart of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability (subpart A) and one subpart that sets forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific additional provisions for raw molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(subpart C). The agency is also setting forth guidelines, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form of appendices, that will provide assistance to processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products (Appendix A), and to processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin forming species (Appendix B), on how to meet various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in subpart A relating to the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of HACCP plans. The products addressed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines involve special considerations or special hazards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which additional guidance would be useful. Processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers that follow these guidelines will increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood that FDA will find their preventive controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable. FDA requests comments on the need for, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance of, the guidelines that it has set forth. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should address whether it would be more appropriate for FDA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt the guidelines as regulations. If the comments provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convincing basis for doing so, FDA will include some or all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guidelines in the regulations in any final rule that results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also including a guideline on how to ensure product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity relating to economic adulteration (Appendix D). FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including this guideline because economic adulteration is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular problem in the seafood industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Appendix 1 to this document, FDA is also providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples from a package of general guidance, to be published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately, for processors to use in understanding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing HACCP principles in their operations. One of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples is specific guidance on the processing of smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish. FDA requests comments on whether the latter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance should remain as such, be provided as guidelines in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix to the regulations, or be made mandatory by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating them into any final rule that results from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is relying generally on the definitions contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the act, in the umbrella good manufacturing practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines in part 110, and in other agency regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is using these definitions because it considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency in how it uses terms in its regulations to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary and appropriate. Thus, &sect;123.3(o) is derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;113.3(s), and &sect;123.3(r) is derived from &sect;110.3(q). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional definitions are proposed in &sect;123.3 that are specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the proposed HACCP program for fish and fishery products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to define ``certification number'' in &sect;123.3(a) as a unique combination of letters
and numbers assigned to a shellfish processor by a shellfish control authority, usually the State. These numbers
are used to identify the processor on tags and labels and in recordkeeping required under proposed &sect;123.28.
States issue certification numbers to processors who receive shellfish from safe sources, keep requisite records
of shellfish purchases and sales, and operate in accordance with CGMP and the other certification requirements of
the State. This system of State issued numbers is used to identify the approximately 2,000 State certified shellfish
dealers that are included on the Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(b) to define ``cooked, ready-to-eat fishery product'' as a fishery product
that is subjected by a commercial processor to either a cooking process before being placed in a final container, or
to pasteurization in the final container, or to both. Cooked, ready-to-eat products undergo a heat treatment by a
processor that results in the coagulation of the protein. Because their organoleptic qualities suggest that they
are fully cooked, and thus ready-to-eat, these products will likely be eaten without any further heat treatment by
the consumer sufficient to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and preformed toxins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined, cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products include products that must be stored either frozen or refrigerated.
Products such as canned seafoods that are subjected to a cooking process after being placed in a final container, while
technically considered cooked, ready-to-eat products, are not included in the definition because they are virtually
sterile in the final container. As used in these proposed regulations, the term applies to cooked, ready-to-eat products
that do not receive a heat treatment in the final container by the processor sufficient to destroy all pathogens and
create a shelf-stable product that does not need refrigeration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(c) to define ``critical control point'' for purposes of these regulations
as a point in a food process where there is a high probability that improper control may cause, allow, or contribute
to a hazard in the final food. This is a modification of the definition of the same term in &sect;110.3(e). Under that
definition, a ``critical control point'' is a point where an improper control could cause, allow, or contribute to
``filth in the final food or decomposition in the final food'' as well as to a ``hazard'' in the final food. Clearly,
that definition is intended to apply both to human food safety and to certain quality issues that would not normally
cause illness. In this document, FDA is proposing to require the identification of critical control points for safety
only and is encouraging, but not requiring, the identification of certain critical control points for hazards not
normally related to safety. The modification of the part 110 definition being proposed here represents the least
revision necessary to achieve that purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``critical limit'' in &sect;123.3(d) as a maximum or minimum value to which a physical,
biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to minimize the risk of occurrence
of the identified hazard. This definition is consistent with that of NACMCF, which defined ``critical limit'' as
``a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with a critical control point'' (Ref. 34, p.
186), but FDA's proposed definition is somewhat more explanatory. Critical limits can be either maximum values,
such as the maximum amount of histamine that can be allowed in a fish, or minimum values, such as the minimum temperature
needed during a cooking step to kill pathogens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition states that control is for the purpose of minimizing risk. While complete prevention of a
hazard is obviously the most desirable of all possible outcomes, the proposed definition recognizes that, in reality,
complete prevention cannot always be ensured. A processor can minimize a microbiological hazard with a cooked, ready-to-eat
product by proper cooking, but the hazard could still occur if the product is contaminated or otherwise abused elsewhere
in the distribution system or in the home. This aspect of the definition is consistent with the view of NACMCF, which
states that: ``Each CCP [critical control point] will have one or more preventive measures that must be properly controlled
to assure prevention, elimination or reduction of hazards to acceptable levels'' (Ref. 34, p. 196). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(e) to define ``fish'' and broadly to encompass the range of seafood products
that are processed or marketed commercially in the United States. Thus, the term ``fish'' includes all fresh or saltwater
finfish, molluscan shellfish, crustaceans, and other forms of aquatic animal life. Birds are specifically excluded
from the definition because commercial species of birds are either nonaquatic or, as in the case of aquatic birds such
as ducks, regulated by USDA. Mammals are also specifically excluded because no aquatic mammals are processed or marketed
commercially in this country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Fishery products'' in proposed &sect;123.3(f) are any edible human food product derived in whole or in part from
fish, including fish that has been processed in any manner. This definition reflects the tentative conclusion of
the agency to propose mandatory HACCP requirements at this time to control hazards associated with processing and
importing seafood products intended for human consumption. The proposed definition includes products that contain
ingredients other than seafood in keeping with the scope of FDA's regulatory authority. The control of hazards is
as important for products that contain ingredients other than fish as it is for products consisting of fish alone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(g) to define ``harvester'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a person who commercially takes molluscan shellfish from their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing waters, by any means. Harvester is defined because, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this proposal, this person has responsibility for tagging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product as to where it was harvested and when. Harvesters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expected to have an identification number issued by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish control authority. Harvesting is generally illegal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without such a number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define the term ``importer'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(h) as the owner of the imported goods or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative in the United States. This is the person who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for ensuring goods being entered are in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all laws affecting the importation. Importers may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always directly handle the imported food, but they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for the safety and wholesomeness of products they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer for entry into the United States and therefore are subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to part 123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that the term ``importer'' is often used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to describe not only the owner of the goods or his representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States (that is, the importer of record) but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes freight forwarders, food brokers, food jobbers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers, and steamship representatives. These other agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often represent the importer for legal and financial purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not necessarily related to the safety of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate to focus the HACCP requirements that bear on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imports on these persons if they do not have authority to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions affecting the product's safety or wholesomeness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to define a ``lot of molluscan shellfish'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(i) as no more than one day's harvest from a single, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined growing area, by one or more harvesters. This definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes the quantity of shellfish that represents a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot for tagging or labeling purposes. Lot distinctions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to differentiate shellfish harvested from different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing areas or at different times. The time limit of one day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is imposed because the safety of a harvesting area can change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily as the result of rainfall, tides, winds, and other events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can bring contaminants into the area. The ultimate safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw molluscan shellfish is contingent on the water quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvesting area. To ensure product safety, shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting areas that are subject to appropriate state control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are closed to harvesting within 24 hours of a finding of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The lot definition, coupled with the harvest date on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvesting tag, provides evidence that the shellfish were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested when the area was safe and open for harvesting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(j) that ``molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish'' means any edible species, or edible portion of fresh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or frozen oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops, except were the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scallop product consists entirely of the shucked adductor mussel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction between molluscan shellfish and crustacean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, which include crabs, shrimp, and lobsters, is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because molluscan shellfish are commonly eaten whole and raw, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while crustacean shellfish are not. The safety of molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish therefore reflects the quality of the waters from which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are harvested and requires special public health controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the agency is proposing to amend the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``shellfish'' in &sect;1240.3(p) (21 CFR 1240.3(p)) to make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the proposed definition in &sect;123.3(j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to amend the term ``shellfish'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1240.3(p) to read ``molluscan shellfish'' to make the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent between parts 123 and 1240. Because the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish in its common usage, i.e., an edible mollusk or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crustacean, includes crabs and lobsters, the agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is necessary to be more specific and accurate in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition and consequent application of the requirements in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The proposed requirements for tagging do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to crabs and lobsters or to scallops when the final product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shucked adductor muscle only. The agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the definition in &sect;1240.3(p) to include scallops to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it consistent with the definitions in proposed part 123 and with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under NSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``potable water'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(k) as water that meets EPA's primary drinking water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 141. Those regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide limits for certain microbiological, chemical, physical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and radiological contaminants that can render water unsafe for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition is slightly different from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``potable water'' in &sect;&sect;1240.3(k) and 1250.3(j) (21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 1250.3(j). That definition also references the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of EPA in 40 CFR part 141 but further includes FDA sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in 21 CFR parts 1240 and 1250. Those sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements apply to interstate travel conveyances that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take on water at watering points. Such requirements are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to these proposed regulations and thus were not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to define ``processing'' and ``processor'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(m) and (n) broadly to ensure the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the application of HACCP principles throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood industry. The definition of ``processor'' is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include all seafood processors that handle products in interstate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce, such as shuckers and other processors of raw molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, factory ships, packers, repackers, wholesalers, and warehouses. Those who process low acid canned foods
are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included, even though they are subject to the HACCP controls of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 113. Those controls are targeted toward a limited number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety hazards. These proposed regulations require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors apply HACCP controls to all likely safety hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the regulations at part 113, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``processor'' also includes persons engaged in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of foods that are to be used in market or consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP controls are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for such products because the hazards associated with them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no different from those that can affect other commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, however, certain handlers of seafood that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the coverage of the proposed definition. Fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels that essentially only harvest are not covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed HACCP regulations. As explained earlier, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditionally refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that the regulations being proposed here 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would affect vessels indirectly through processor and importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls over raw materials and imported shipments, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls such as the purchasing of raw materials only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from fishing vessels that engage in proper sanitation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature practices and that harvest only from approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transportation companies that carry, but do not otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, fish and fishery products are also outside the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed definition, although the agency expects that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transporters will be affected indirectly in the same manner as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishing vessels (see also &sect;110.93). FDA invites comment on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect of the coverage of the proposed regulations. Proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration during transport is important for the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombroid species products and of cooked, ready-to-eat products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Time and temperature conditions during shipment can also affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition related to other factors bearing on seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality. These proposed regulations will affect transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies indirectly through the preventive controls the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer will need to impose to ensure that the raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials or imported shipments that it receives are free of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant hazards and have been appropriately handled. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites public discussion on whether this approach is adequate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, if not, whether HACCP requirements should be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to transportation companies. This issue is complex, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially because it is not unusual for transporters to deliver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a variety of food products, including seafood, to several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consignees during a single shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has also tentatively decided to exclude retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments from the definition of ``processor.'' As with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishing vessels, FDA has traditionally exercised enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion with regard to retail establishments. The number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail establishments in this country_literally in the hundreds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of thousands_would totally overwhelm any rational Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection system. FDA has traditionally provided training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other forms of technical assistance to States and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments to inspect retail food establishments through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's retail Federal/State cooperative program. A major part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that cooperative program involves the development of model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codes, some of which have been widely adopted by State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments. FDA is now consolidating those model codes into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single, updated food code for the retail sector. Appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP-based controls are included to address seafood hazards at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail. Consequently, FDA will continue to operate through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal/State cooperative mechanism and has not included a retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component in proposed part 123. FDA requests comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are strongly encouraged, however, to consider how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles in these regulations could be applied to seafood at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail and to shift to HACCP-type inspection systems as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Because of the high perishability of fresh seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the sometimes lengthy and complex distribution chain, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products can have relatively short shelf lives by the time they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reach fresh fish counters and restaurants. In addition, seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be subject at retail both to cross-contamination because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poor handling practices and to species substitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improper handling of seafood and other problems at retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been documented in recent years. NAS has concluded that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant number of reported acute health problems were likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linked to handling and preparation practices in food service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments (Ref. 7, p. 27). The February, 1992 edition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Reports magazine reported on a number of such problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to seafood that were observed in retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments. A number of studies have found lack of adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature controls in retail facilities (Ref. 48, p. 75). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``shellfish control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority'' in &sect;123.3(p) as the government entity responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing a comprehensive shellfish sanitation program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish control authority, among other things, is responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for classifying shellfish growing waters, performing inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of shellfish processors, and issuing certification numbers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish processors. FDA relies on recognized governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and food control agencies, both domestic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign, to carry out these functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``shellstock'' in &sect;123.3(q) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as meaning raw, in-shell molluscan shellfish. This specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product form designation is needed because the applicability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tagging, labeling, and recordkeeping requirements proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.28(b) and (c) is determined by whether the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellstock or shucked product, respectively.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to define ``shucked shellfish'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(s) as meaning molluscan shellfish that have one or both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shells removed. The labeling and recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in &sect;123.28(c) apply to shucked shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``tag'' in &sect;123.3(t) as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record of harvesting information attached to a container of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellstock by the harvester or processor. Under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1240.60(b), the tag or bill-of-lading will identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, harvester, date of harvest, and State, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific location of harvest. Most shellfish-producing States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and countries currently require that shellfish harvested in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters bear documentation with such information. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is the minimum necessary to permit ready 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of site and time of harvest of the shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because raw molluscan shellfish directly reflect the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvesting area, this information is necessary to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that the shellfish were harvested from an area that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe and open for harvesting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose and Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 123.5(a) of the proposed regulations references the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
umbrella CGMP guidelines in part 110 as providing general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance with regard to such matters as facility design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, personnel practices, and cleaning and sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. Because part 110 provides guidance of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability to all foods, the agency intends that this guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to be valid for seafood processors when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations at part 123 are issued in final form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.5(b) makes clear that the purpose of subpart A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 123 is to set forth requirements specific to the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importation of fish and fishery products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. HACCP Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.6 that commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers of fish and fishery products develop and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement HACCP plans in keeping with Principle 6 of the NACMCF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed previously. Development and implementation of an HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan requires that processors think through the entire process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow from raw materials to finished product shipping to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that safety hazards are controlled by design, and that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate that process as a matter of daily routine. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers, the thought process will begin with a decision from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom and from where to buy fishery products and follow through to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements for shipment to the United States, storage in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States, and end when the product leaves the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer. The plan provides the structure for the preventive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, including the recordkeeping associated with those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, that a processor or importer is to employ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FDA has tentatively concluded that the essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of this structure must include: (1) The identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hazards to ensure that the processor or importer knows what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards are, so that it controls them by design rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by chance (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)); (2) the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points to ensure that the processor or importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knows where to monitor to prevent or minimize the occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relevant hazard (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(2)); (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of critical limits that must be met at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control point, so that the processor or importer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective standards in place by which to determine whether it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling the relevant hazard (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(3)); (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification of procedures for how and when the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or importer will monitor the critical control points to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both that monitoring is done as a matter of routine, and that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is done in an appropriate manner and with sufficient frequency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish preventive control (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4)); and (5) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping system for that monitoring that will establish for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor's or importer's benefit that it is effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing a system of preventive controls, and record how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those controls are operating over time (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(b)(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recordkeeping system is the key to HACCP. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the records will enable the processor or importer, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately the regulator, to see the operations of the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or importer through time, rather than only how they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning at a particular moment in time. Among other things, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP records can reveal trends that might otherwise go 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undetected until significant problems occurred.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of these requirements reflect the HACCP principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed by NACMCF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to require that the HACCP plan be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed by any official of a company, but invites comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merits of such a requirement in the final regulations as a means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both ensuring and demonstrating formal adoption of the plan by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that company. FDA also invites comment on who in the firm would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the appropriate individual to sign the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Guidelines and Other Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that HACCP plans will vary in complexity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from those having many critical control points, such as plans for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multicomponent, ready-to-eat products, to those having only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points, such as a plan for a fish filleting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant. Plan development can be facilitated by technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from many sources and by the detailed advice provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the literature. NACMCF, for example, has recommended that, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the development of HACCP plans, processors should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create an HACCP team, identify the intended use and likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers of the food, and prepare a flow diagram of the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing process to help identify critical control points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency favors simplicity and the rapid development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans without undue expense. The appendices at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations are intended to facilitate plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development by setting forth certain critical control points, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits, controls, and records that, if incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or prepared under a HACCP plan, would be acceptable to the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the types of products mentioned. To further facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of HACCP plans, FDA intends to issue separate HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance for seafood that will provide information on hazards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate controls by species and by product type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance will provide a broad spectrum of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from which firms will be able to identify likely hazards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points that apply to them. The agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the number of critical control points will range, roughly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 2 and 12 per product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance will also contain a fill-in-the-blank type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plan with instructions on how to complete the plan based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the guidance. The agency has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that a plan that follows this model is likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to FDA. The agency is including samples of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance it is developing in Appendix 1 to this document. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to issue a separate draft guidance document for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment and to make the completed guidance available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public at the time that the regulations are finalized.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, seafood trade associations, university Sea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant extension offices, and others have already developed work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheets and other aids to facilitate HACCP planning for seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry members are encouraged to contact their trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations and state universities or Sea Grant extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices on such matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even with these forms of assistance, however, FDA recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HACCP plans cannot be written and implemented overnight. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has already been discussed, the HACCP system of controls can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve new ways of thinking and performing on a routine basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA is proposing that these regulations will become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective 1 year after issuance of the final rule in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding. The agency has tentatively concluded that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time is sufficient to permit the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of HACCP plans by the industry. FDA specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on whether 1 year will be adequate. The agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective is to provide enough time to permit processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers to understand HACCP, analyze the relevant hazards, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop an appropriate HACCP plan, but also to avoid unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the proposed effective date, inspection of HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will occur as part of routine, mandatory plant inspections and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import examinations. FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans be submitted to FDA in advance, or that preapproval by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a condition of their adoption or implementation. FDA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring preapproval for two reasons. First, HACCP plans can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only properly be judged in the context of the facility itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, while FDA investigators will consider the adequacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan during their inspections, preapproval does not seem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted. Second, the agency simply does not have the resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make preapproval a requirement. Given the protections that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are built into the HACCP approach, FDA tentatively finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preapproval is not necessary to ensure that fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are not produced under conditions whereby they may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Location and Product Type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.6(a) to require that every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor and importer have and implement an HACCP plan that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific both to each location where that processor engages in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing and to each kind of fish and fishery product being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed. A plan should be specific to each location because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the likely hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring procedures can vary from one facility to the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on such factors as type of equipment, conditions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, and location. A plan also should be specific to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of fish and fishery product for the same kinds of reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazards can vary depending on species, location of catch, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not intend, however, to require a processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer to write a separate plan, or separate part of a plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each fish and fishery product it handles if the likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are identical for each of them. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls necessary to ensure safety for most deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water species of finfish from the north Atlantic may be virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical. The agency has tentatively concluded that, in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, a processor or importer may group the fish or fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products together in an HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Safety Hazards Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.6(b)(1) that HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans identify the human food safety hazards that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled for each fish and fishery product being processed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer. There exists a range of opinion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether HACCP should apply solely to safety hazards, as this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision proposes to require, or whether HACCP should apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other types of hazards, such as decomposition not normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with illness in humans. One school of thought holds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HACCP should apply to safety hazards only in order to keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it focused and to not overwhelm operators with an unnecessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large number of critical control points that have no bearing on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the primary concern of safety. Another view holds that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood at least, HACCP-type controls can be applied to various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer risks without generating an excessive number of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene came to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter conclusion (Ref. 46), as did NOAA as a result of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences during the MSSP (Ref. 35, p. 70). Partly for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs involved HACCP controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for safety and HACCP-type controls for other hazards as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of these proposed regulations, however, FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of HACCP is intended for the efficient enforcement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act, which applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that contain substances that may render the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injurious to health and to processing conditions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitary and that could render a product injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include identification of hazards that could affect human food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety only. To facilitate the production of such plans, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1) the types of hazards that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been associated with seafood (see section II.C. of this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a discussion of these hazards). All of these hazards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and discussed in the NAS report on seafood safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors and importers should identify in their written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans only those safety hazards that are reasonably likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur, rather than every conceivable hazard no matter how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
theoretical or remote. This view is in keeping with NACMCF's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation that firms conduct a hazard analysis and then give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no further consideration to hazards that are unlikely to occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 34, p. 189). FDA has tentatively concluded that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers should not be required to establish controls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly monitor for hazards that are highly unlikely to occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the absence of those controls. If, for example, chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants have never been found, or have only been found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts significantly below levels of public health concern in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species from a particular location, processors and importers need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not identify chemical contaminants as a hazard that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled for that fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated earlier in this preamble, FDA intends to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a guidance document that will cover possible environmental and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing hazards for fish and fishery products as well as types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of controls that can be applied to those hazards. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipates that it will update that guidance periodically as new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls (or new hazards) are identified or established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA cannot reasonably expect processors and importers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise controls for hazards that are beyond the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current scientific knowledge. The agency does expect processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers to demonstrate that they are taking precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are reasonable in light of available information, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are adopting new controls as those controls are developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accepted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the controls for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bacteria in raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish, which can cause serious illness and death in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain at-risk populations, are the subject of continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research at FDA and elsewhere. Short of a complete ban on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting, there is no known control that would prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrios 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in molluscan shellfish. Moreover, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infectious dose, that is, the number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrios 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause illness, is unknown. Because these bacteria occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
naturally in the environment and are ubiquitous, controls that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are employed to prevent sewage-related viruses from entering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish are not relevant to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrios. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is known, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, that proper temperature controls from the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest onward can at least limit the growth of these bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 49). FDA believes that such controls are reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be applied now. (In fact, temperature controls have long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been a feature of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NSSP).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the hazards listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b), pesticides and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug residues (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v)) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms of chemical contaminants (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(iii)) but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed separately because they can be of special concern in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculture-raised species. These fish generally have a greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood of being exposed to agricultural run-off than wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ocean stocks (Ref. 50, pp. 11 and 12). Aquaculture-raised fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are known to be fed drugs for various purposes. Drug residues in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edible tissues can be a public health concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decomposition, listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(vi), is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known hazard in those species that can generate scombrotoxin when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they decompose; otherwise, it is regarded as a quality problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parasites (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(vii)) are not a hazard if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killed during cooking but can be a hazard in finfish consumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw, unless that fish is commercially frozen. Unapproved direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and indirect food and color additives (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(b)(1)(viii)) are a potential hazard with most any food.

6. Critical Control Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the HACCP principles identified by NACMCF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.6(b)(2) that critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points be identified for each of the hazards that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer has identified. Hazards may be caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper processing or by events outside the processor's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer's direct control. To control the latter type of hazard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, environmental hazards and hazards that may be caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poor handling prior to receipt of fish or fishery products by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer, the point of receipt by the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer represents a critical control point. As indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously in this preamble, the processor or importer may need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that it obtains imported shipments or raw materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only from harvesters, transporters, and others who can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that they also have exercised appropriate controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hazards that may be caused by both improper processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events outside the plant are controlled by the critical limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, control procedures, and recordkeeping that are done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of HACCP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Critical Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;123.6(b)(3), consistent with NACMCF principles, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that processors and importers identify critical limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the plan that must be met at each critical control point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical limits must be met to ensure that the relevant hazard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoided. Thus, some critical limits can be set to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory levels established by FDA in the form of action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, regulatory limits, and tolerances for such contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as pesticides, histamine, and other contaminants. FDA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compile all such levels in the guidance document described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other critical limits can be set in consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside experts, in keeping with the longstanding practice for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low acid canned foods. For example, as explained later in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble with respect to cooked, ready-to-eat products, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist a range of possible cooking time-temperature combinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will deactivate pathogens during the cooking step, depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the type of equipment being used by the processor and the size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and species of fish being cooked. The existence of a range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective cooking time-temperature combinations convinced FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to establish specific cooking time-temperatures for industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulations for low acid canned foods. Rather, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to rely on outside experts and on research within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific community to establish cooking times and temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these products. FDA is not proposing specific cooking time-temperature requirements for most seafood products
(although FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is providing guidance on time, temperature, and salinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for smoked and smoke-flavored fish, as is fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained in Appendix 1 to this document) for the same reason. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Monitoring and Control Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) requires that the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer identify in the HACCP plan the procedures that it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use to control and monitor each critical control point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring steps are necessary to ensure that the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point is in fact under control and to produce an accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record of what has occurred at the critical control point (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34, p. 197). Among the procedures that are to be used under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) is monitoring of the consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the processor. While the goal of an HACCP system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent all likely hazards from occurring, no system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foolproof. Consumer complaints may be the first alert that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor has that deviations are occurring that are not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevented or uncovered by the processor's HACCP controls. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has tentatively concluded, therefore, that each HACCP system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should take advantage of consumer complaints as they relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation of critical control points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) also requires that procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling and monitoring critical control points must include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration of process control instruments and validation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software for computer control systems, as appropriate. For a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's preventive controls to work, the instruments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that it relies upon in monitoring critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points, such as thermometers, temperature-recording devices, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer software, must be accurate and reliable. FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concluded that the best way to ensure such accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reliability is to require that the processor's monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures include steps necessary to verify the reliability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these instruments and devices.

9. Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained above, a HACCP system will not work unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records are generated during the operation of the HACCP plan, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these records are maintained and are available for review (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section IV.A.6. of this document). Thus, FDA is requiring in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(b)(5) that the HACCP plan provide for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping system that will document the processor's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer's monitoring of the critical control points. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(b)(5) also requires that HACCP records contain the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values obtained during monitoring, such as the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures and times. FDA has tentatively concluded that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not possible for the processor to derive the full benefits of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system, nor is it possible for FDA to verify the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the system, without actual values. Notations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration temperatures are satisfactory or unsatisfactory, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without recording the actual temperatures, are vague and subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to varying interpretation and thus will not ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls are working. Also, it is not possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discern trends without actual values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, proposed &sect;123.6(b)(5) requires that HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records include the actual consumer complaints that may have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the processor or importer relating to the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of critical control points or possible critical limit deviations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded that it may be necessary on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasion for it to review these complaints in order to be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validate whether the firm is taking necessary steps to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls and correct deviations as necessary in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not FDA's intent to gain unlimited access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry's consumer complaint files through this proposal or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engage in ``fishing expeditions'' through consumer complaint files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only those consumer complaints relating to the operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP critical control points need be included as HACCP records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's interest is solely in verifying that the HACCP system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working as it should. The agency understands the sensitivities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with consumer complaint records and invites comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this aspect of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Nonsafety Hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;123.6(c) encourages, but does not require, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers to include in their plans controls for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards other than hazards to health. Examples listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(c)(1)(i) and (ii) are decomposition not associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human illness and economic adulteration. FDA is not requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers to include nonsafety hazards in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans for reasons stated previously. However, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is encouraging processors and importers to apply HACCP principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these nonsafety hazards, and to control them in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner that processors and importers control safety hazards (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(c)(2)), because they are common problems in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood industry. FDA has included a guideline on economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulteration with these proposed regulations (see Appendix D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the fact that these proposed regulations do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require HACCP controls for nonsafety hazards, such hazards as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic adulteration, decomposition not normally associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human illness, general unfitness for food, and misbranding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute violations of the act and are subject to regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action by FDA (see sections 402(a)(3) and 403 of the act (21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 343). Inspections by FDA investigators will continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider and enforce these provisions of the act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Corrective Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.7 to require that deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits trigger a prescribed series of actions by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer, including determining the significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deviation, taking appropriate remedial action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documenting the actions taken. This proposed provision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the HACCP principles enunciated by NACMCF (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34). First, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(1), any critical limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation will require the segregation and holding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected product until the significance of the deviation can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined. This step is necessary to ensure that products that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be injurious to health do not enter commerce until the impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deviation on safety has been determined, and the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product assured. Second, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(2), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer must actually determine the effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation on safety, and third, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(3), it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must take whatever corrective actions are necessary with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to both the affected product and the critical control point at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the deviation occurred, based on that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some deviations, especially if they are caught quickly, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not adversely affect safety. For example, if a refrigeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit fails, but product being stored there is moved to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning unit before any appreciable warming of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can occur, safety will not have been affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(a)(2) that the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination be made by an individual who has successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed training in HACCP principles (see proposed &sect;123.9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded that this requirement is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the person who is reviewing the significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deviation understands the possible consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing deviation and knows how to take appropriate measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in response to a deviation. FDA does not expect that a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or importer will be able, without assistance, to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health consequences of every possible deviation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required training will, however, provide the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer with information about when and how to obtain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance of an analytical laboratory, outside expert, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authority, or FDA district office in determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper course of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(a)(4) and (a)(5) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor or importer review the process and the HACCP plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether the deviation reveals the need to modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or the plan, or both, and to make such modifications as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be needed. It is critically important that a processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer learn as much as possible from the occurrence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation and take steps to ensure that it will not be repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan should be a living document that the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer should modify and update as circumstances warrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed requirements will ensure that the processor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer connect day-to-day processing and other operations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan. Each modification is required to be noted, dated, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained as part of their HACCP records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(b) that when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer receives a consumer complaint that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the performance of a critical control point or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may reflect a critical limit deviation, it take appropriate steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether a deviation or other system failure has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred that warrants remedial action and take such remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action that appears to be warranted under &sect;123.7(a). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of consumer complaints has been discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that segregation and holding of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product will not always be feasible or warranted in response to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer complaint. In many cases, there will be no product to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold because all of the product in question will already be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. In other cases, a processor or importer may be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine very quickly whether a deviation has actually occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.7(c) to require that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers clearly document all of the steps that they take in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to a critical limit deviation or a consumer complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and include that documentation as part of their HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. FDA has tentatively concluded that the processor, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer, and FDA will benefit from this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation helps processors and importers to think the whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process through in a thorough and methodical way and to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their own satisfaction that they have taken proper steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation enables the regulatory agency to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor or importer is able to regain control once a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation occurs and to ensure that potentially unsafe products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are being prevented from entering commerce or at least quickly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documentation that FDA is proposing to require of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's or importer's response to the consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by &sect;123.7(b) will enable the processor, the importer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and FDA reviewers to determine whether those consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are receiving appropriate attention in a timely manner. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation should be clear enough to allow a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nature of the complaint and of the time it took from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the complaint for processor or importer to review it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to take any necessary corrective actions. FDA may choose on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasion to review a limited number of consumer complaints to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
match against the documentation maintained by the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the importer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a strong view in the HACCP literature (see e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ref. 51), which is reflected in one of NACMCF's seven principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed above, that processors should actually have a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing how they will handle deviations, and that this plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be part of the overall HACCP plan. FDA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is merit in this view and encourages processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers to think through how they will handle deviations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may occur. The agency has tentatively concluded, however, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed requirements in &sect;123.7 represent the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements necessary to ensure that processors and importers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond effectively to deviations that could affect safety, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that given these provisions, it is not necessary to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific plan be formulated and adopted. FDA requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this tentative conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, maintenance of appropriate records is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fundamental to the success of an HACCP system (see section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV.A.6. of this document). In recognition of this fact, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require in &sect;123.8 that HACCP records contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain necessary information; that processors review records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and related activities before distributing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to which the records pertain; that processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers retain records for specific periods of time; and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA investigators be given access to HACCP records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(a) that records involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations or measurements during processing, corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and related activities, contain the identity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, product code, and date that the record was made. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of this provision is to ensure that both the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer and the regulator can readily link a record to a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to the timeframe in which the product was manufactured. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linkage of the record to product is especially important when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there has been a deviation at a critical control point. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency has tentatively concluded that including the identity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, product code, and date of the activity that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record reflects provide the minimum necessary information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the processor or the importer and, ultimately, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulator to determine what product may have been affected and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take appropriate action, such as withholding the product from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution or recalling it from distribution. Dates also help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discern trends over time. Even when no deviation has occurred, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information will enable both the processor and the regulator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify factors that may help prevent problems in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.8(a), FDA is also proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be recorded at the time that it is observed, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each record be signed by the operator or observer. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important that information relating to observations be recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately to ensure accuracy. The record should be signed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual who made the observation to ensure responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accountability. Also, if there is a question about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record, a signature ensures that the source of the record will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.8(b) that records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive a second review by an individual trained in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;123.9, for verification purposes, before the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed into commerce. The purpose of this review is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the processor or importer verifies that employees are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording data in HACCP records, and that deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits are being caught before products that may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been affected can enter commerce. The agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that this records verification be performed by a trained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to ensure that the records are reviewed by a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who understands the HACCP system, understands the significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a processing deviation, and knows how to respond if a deviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(c) to require that HACCP records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be retained for at least 1 year after they are prepared for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated products and for at least 2 years after they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for frozen or preserved (i.e., shelf-stable) products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These timeframes are based on the length of time that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products can be expected to be in commercial distribution (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52; Ref. 53, pp. 72&hyph;73) plus a reasonable time thereafter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the records are there when the FDA inspector performs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next inspection. They are the same timeframes as now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for in the Manual of Operations of the NSSP for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retention of records for raw molluscan shellfish.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, FDA is also proposing to require in &sect;123.8(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processor retain any records relating to the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the equipment or processes being used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, including the results of scientific studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations to determine adequacy, for 1 year beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of these records to refrigerated products being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by the processor, and for 2 years beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of the records to frozen or preserved products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being produced by the processor. The processor may need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain a written scientific evaluation of a process, such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking, pasteurization, or cooling process, to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process it is using is adequate to destroy pathogens or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent their growth. Such an evaluation may also be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the adequacy of the cooking, pasteurizing, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerating equipment that the processor is using. (See the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with processing records, these records should be retained for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a period of time that reflects the period that the products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they relate can be expected to be in commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that some processing plants may be closed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a seasonal basis. Given the nature of the HACCP system, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA may choose to inspect at least the records of a plant even if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant is not in operation. Therefore, FDA is providing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8(c) that if a processing facility is closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between seasonal packs, the records may be transferred to some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably accessible location during the period of closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.8(d) that HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and records be available for review and copying by authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency employees at reasonable times. As already discussed, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's access to HACCP records is essential to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system is working, and that the safety of seafood is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensured by design. FDA's authority to require maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these records, and to provide for agency access to them, is fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported by the holding in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 387 U.S. 158, 163&hyph;164 (1967). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of the records in ensuring that fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products will not be rendered injurious to health has been fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed. FDA access to these records will expedite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's efforts to ensure that the fish and fishery products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce are not adulterated and to identify any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that are. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is aware that there is substantial public interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent to which industry-generated HACCP records could or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be publicly available. As FDA understands it, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argument in favor of availability is that where an inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system to protect the public health relies heavily on records, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those records should be public to the maximum extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The arguments in favor of protection of records, on the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand, are based on concerns about advantages to competitors from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure and on the risk that the records will be otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misused if they become public. FDA invites comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general question of public disclosure of HACCP records and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's preliminary analysis of their availability, as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has longstanding explicit statutory access to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry records during inspections involving infant formula, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs, and devices and has access by regulation to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing records during inspections of low acid canned food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors. The agency has the right to copy and take possession 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these records but does not routinely do so. FDA typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies and takes possession of records only when they may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for regulatory purposes. As a preliminary matter, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects to continue that practice with regard to seafood HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public availability of those HACCP records that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would possess as a result of copying during an inspection would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be governed by section 301(j) of the act and by the Freedom of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Act (FOIA) and regulations issued pursuant to it by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301(j) of the act expressly prohibits FDA from disclosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade secret information obtained during the course of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. The FOIA regulations also say that FDA will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divulge either trade secret or commercial confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. As a preliminary matter, HACCP plans and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records appear to fall within these two categories of protected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. As a consequence, FDA may well have little discretion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this area. Moreover, under DHHS' FOIA regulations, processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be entitled to challenge in court a pending disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records on the grounds that the records to be disclosed are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial confidential or trade secret. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional matter, there are significant legal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical questions as to whether FDA has the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require disclosure of industry records that are not in FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession. As discussed elsewhere in this document, FDA does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contemplate the submission of HACCP plans or other records to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA under these proposed regulations. The preapproval of HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans by FDA (and thus the submission of HACCP plans to FDA) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simply not practical. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans and monitoring records will be reviewed on site by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency investigators as part of FDA's normal inspection regime.

FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(e) to exempt tags as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(t) from the recordkeeping requirements of &sect;123.8. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information on tags must be saved in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirements of this section and &sect;123.28(d), the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has tentatively concluded that it would be burdensome for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors to be required to retain the tags themselves for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended periods of time. NSSP now provides that processors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain tags for 90 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;123.9 requires that each processor and importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employ at least one individual who has successfully completed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training course on the application of HACCP to fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products processing. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training is critical to the successful implementation of HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems in the seafood industry. Based on experience obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs in 1991&hyph;92, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that a significant portion of the seafood industry will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unprepared to meet the requirements of a mandatory HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program without some training. As discussed earlier, the pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program revealed a general lack of understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive nature of HACCP, including misunderstandings about how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish critical limits, control measures, corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and recordkeeping procedures (Ref. 40). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar concern that the industry did not understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of HACCP principles formed the basis for the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the agency's regulations for low acid canned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods. Improvements in canning operations can be attributed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant measure to the success of the training programs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were established to implement that requirement (Ref. 54). NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the successful application of HACCP principles to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low acid canned foods was substantially the result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirement in the regulations for those products (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36, p. 309). The CGMP regulations for foods in part 110 also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
call for training in appropriate food protection principles (&sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110.10(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The often seasonal nature, remote location, and small size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of many seafood processors also support the need for formalized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. All of these conditions result in difficulty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruiting highly qualified management and supervisory staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA has tentatively concluded that proposed &sect;123.9 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure that seafood processors and importers employ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least one person who is familiar with HACCP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations propose to require at &sect;123.9 that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person or persons at each importing and processing establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who has received training be responsible for reviewing records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control point monitoring, recognizing critical limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, and assessing the need for corrective actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the product in question and the HACCP plan itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is the intent of the agency to provide as much guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible to assist processors and importers, these activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require specialized training in the principles of HACCP, various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of food science, and the criteria of existing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that 2- or 3-day training sessions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeled after the Better Process Control Schools currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place for low acid canned food and acidified food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, will be provided by various public and semiprivate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. The uniformity of this training can be assured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a review of their contents and by periodic onsite monitoring by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency. Thus, FDA is proposing to require that the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instruction be approved by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While 2- or 3-day courses may well become the norm, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on whether the training requirement could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied by different gradations of training, depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity or size of the operation, or on the degree of risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posed by the product being produced, without compromising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes for which training is proposed to be required. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, could training for a small business with few hazards be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in a shorter time and at a lower cost through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a video? FDA also invites comment on whether training in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP received before these proposed regulations become effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as final regulations should be ``grandfathered'' as fulfilling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirement.

1. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10 that processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers that engage in processing perform sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections at specified frequencies and maintain sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control records that document the results and frequency of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. If these regulations are adopted, the sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control records will be subject to the recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;123.8, including review by FDA investigators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For seafood, sanitary practices affect most directly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of those products that do not receive any further cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the consumer. These products include raw molluscan shellfish; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finfish destined to be consumed as sushi; cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products; and certain smoked and salted products. Both finfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shellfish are regarded as microbiologically sensitive foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the potential presence of pathogens, notably 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 55, pp. 31 and 32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a pathogenic bacterium that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widespread in the environment. Thus, the likelihood of finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linked to contaminated foods. Although it is a relatively rare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness, the exceptionally high mortality rate among susceptible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous seafood products have been shown to support growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 56 and 57), and seafoods have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiologically linked to two outbreaks and one sporadic case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of listeriosis (Ref. 58). Furthermore, several cooked seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products have been recalled from the market in North America 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of contamination with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 27). Seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 in the environment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the products (Ref. 59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good sanitation practices are critical to the prevention of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listeriosis and other microbiologically related foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses. FDA's CGMP regulations for food in part 110 set out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general principles of sanitation that should be followed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants that manufacture, package, label, or hold human food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They address such matters as personal hygiene and cleanliness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among workers who handle food, the suitability of the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design to sanitary operations, and the cleaning of food-contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces. FDA inspections of seafood processors apply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles in part 110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly half of the consumer complaints relating to seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that FDA receives in a typical year are related to plant or food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hygiene (Ref. 60). The reasons, while not entirely clear, appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be related to factors such as the age of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, the seasonal nature of operations that affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, and the turnover of personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A representative cross section of those FDA establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection reports (EIR's) for domestic seafood manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that revealed CGMP deficiencies for fiscal years 1988&hyph;90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates this point (Ref. 61). The cross section involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
795 EIR's covering 561 facilities. (The number of EIR's exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of facilities because followup visits were made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check on the status of corrective actions.) The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentages refer to EIR's with deficiencies where at least some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deficiencies involved sanitation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Twenty-three percent documented receiving area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that were not clean/orderly or in good repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Twenty-six percent documented facilities lacking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective insect and rodent control measures in the receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sixteen percent documented failure to handle ice in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitary manner and to protect it properly.

(4) Thirty-five percent documented lack of adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning or sanitizing of processing equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Twenty-one percent documented processing equipment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not constructed so that it could be easily cleaned and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Eighteen percent documented processing equipment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not made of suitable materials.

not kept at proper sanitizing levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Eighteen percent documented failure to have hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizers available in the processing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Thirty percent documented processing areas that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not maintained in a clean and sanitary manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Forty-two percent documented processing areas with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exterior openings that were not sealed/covered properly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the entrance of pests or insects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Sixteen percent documented waste material not being

properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Twenty-three percent documented handling of finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product in a manner that did not preclude contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Twenty-two percent documented employees not taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary precautions to avoid food contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During fiscal years 1991&hyph;92, FDA conducted abbreviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections of nearly all domestic manufacturers in its seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment inventory. These inspections provide data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation practices and conditions that are generally consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the above findings (Ref. 62). Examples of these data are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sixteen percent of firms had problems with the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation condition of their processing areas. (This percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is lower than for item 9 above because the universe is all firms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not just firms with deficiencies.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nineteen percent of firms did not clean and sanitize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their processing areas or equipment throughout the day's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. (This matches most closely with item 4 above but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower, presumably for the reason stated in the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbered paragraph.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Twenty-eight percent of firms had employees that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not following proper sanitation practices in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. (This figure does not precisely match any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items listed above because the EIR's break employee practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
down into specific categories, such as the wearing of hair nets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some categories involve relatively minor matters, others are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant. Findings with respect to these employee practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not listed above for the sake of brevity.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Twenty percent had employees that were not following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper sanitation practices for packaging and finished product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. (The parenthetical observations in the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbered paragraph apply here as well.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Thirty-six percent of firms either lacked hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizers in their processing areas or had sanitizers that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not kept at proper sanitizing levels. (This finding is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to a combination of items 7 and 8 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surprisingly, this finding is roughly the same as 7 and 8 added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together, even though it includes all processors rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors with deficiencies.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanitation problems found by NMFS during the operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its fee-for-service inspection program for seafood manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described earlier, are generally consistent with FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings. Entrants into the NMFS program undergo initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation surveys by NMFS and are checked for sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices thereafter. NMFS' data show significant sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies during the initial surveys (Ref. 35, p. 40). Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the most common for 1989 include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sixty-four percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to proper cleaning and sanitizing of product contact surfaces or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, containers, or utensils after use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Fifty-one percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to design, materials, or construction that prevented their being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in a sanitary manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Forty-five percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to design of equipment, containers, and utensils so that they did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not provide protection from contaminants and could not be readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned and effectively sanitized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Forty-three percent of plants had discrepancies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to improper storage of equipment, litter, waste, uncut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeds, and grass.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Forty percent had discrepancies relating to storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that were not clean, sanitary, or in good repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For established participants in the NMFS program (as opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to entrants), the percentages with discrepancies in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas for 1989 were: 49 percent; 47 percent; 25 percent; 49 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent; and 33 percent (Ref. 35, p. 42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA has tentatively concluded on the basis of all of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings that HACCP-type controls for sanitation as proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below are needed. The sanitation measures required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.10 are fundamental to good sanitation practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and can have a bearing on human safety. The agency recognizes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, that depending on the conditions in a facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional measures may be necessary (see, e.g., part 110). FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will expect processors to include those measures in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation practices but tentatively concludes that it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to include them in the fundamental core of required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA acknowledges the conclusion of the MSSP project that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for seafood at least, it is possible to include sanitation within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an HACCP system without unduly overburdening that system with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large numbers of critical control points. The FDA/NOAA HACCP-based seafood pilot program included critical control
points for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation. For these regulations, however, FDA has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to propose specific HACCP-type requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation, rather than require that processors identify critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points for sanitation in their HACCP plans. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in &sect;123.10 potentially relate to an entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, not just to a limited number of critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points. FDA tentatively concludes that this step is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully implement section 402(a)(4) of the act and yet at the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time not overload the HACCP system. FDA invites comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In particular, FDA invites comment on whether sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements should be enumerated as in proposed &sect;123.10. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logical alternative would be to leave sanitation as one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that is to be identified and addressed in HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the control of microbiological and physical hazards (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(ix), and (b)(4)), but not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have specific provisions in the regulations as to how sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be achieved. Good sanitation blocks avenues for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction of pathogens, harmful chemicals, and physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objects and is an essential preventive control for safety. Even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a product is to be cooked by the consumer, the load of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological pathogens on that product when received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer is still relevant to safety. FDA's prescriptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach to sanitation in proposed &sect;123.10 is intended to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors to provide the greatest protection for consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, FDA invites comment on whether an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach as described above would ensure this protection at less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10(a) to require that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct sanitation inspections to ensure that the sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions in &sect;123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) are met. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that the nature of the operations conducted by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor affects the hazards that may be presented by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Processing other than storing usually involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manipulation of exposed, i.e., unpackaged, fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Both the manipulation and the exposure subject the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to all the hazards that can occur from unsanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. Storage, on the other hand, can subject the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to some, but nowhere near all, of the hazards associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitation. Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors of fish and fishery products inspect for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions in &sect;123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) that are appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their circumstances. FDA expects that, at a minimum, in, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, storage facilities, such inspections will include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring against the presence of vermin, because this is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent problem in warehouses that can affect products even when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are being stored in a packaged state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In &sect;123.10(a)(1), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors ensure that water that contacts the product or food-contact surfaces, or that is used in the manufacture
of ice, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from a safe and sanitary source or is treated to render 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it of safe and sanitary quality. Water is used in virtually all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery product processing facilities for washing raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, product contact surfaces, and employees' hands. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to transport fish through the plant in water flumes. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, water is often an ingredient, as in soups and glazes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contaminated water can serve as a vehicle for contamination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, both directly and indirectly (Refs. 63, 64; 65, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49; 66, 67, and 68, pp. 1 and 2). It can also serve as a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contamination as the ice in which the product is stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The safety and sanitary quality of water from United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and some foreign public water systems is generally ensured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through public water treatment, chlorination, or monitoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control by local health authorities. Where this assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists, FDA does not anticipate that processors will need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement any additional controls.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Private sources of water, particularly surface waters or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water from shallow wells, may be subject to microbiological, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical, or radiological contamination attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source itself or to surface contamination at the well head or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intake. Private sources are also frequently untreated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimally treated (Refs. 69, p. 15; and 70). Where the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses a private source of water, it will need to take steps to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the water is of a safe and sanitary quality. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps may include retaining a copy of the initial local health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority well design approval and copies of the local health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority fecal coliform test results; obtaining and maintaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of private coliform test results; performing and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspections of the sanitary condition of the well head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or source intake; and performing and monitoring appropriate water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment procedures, including filtration, sedimentation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The type and frequency of controls exercised by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor should be based upon the type of source water and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic safety and sanitary quality. Consequently, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing to require, in &sect;123.10(c)(3), that such controls be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed and documented at such frequency as necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. In &sect;123.10(a)(2), as a means of ensuring that potable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water does not become contaminated, the agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the processor ensure that there are no cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connections between the potable water system and any nonpotable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. Nonpotable systems include waste water and sewage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cross connections, which include situations that allow for back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
siphonage into a potable system from a nonpotable system under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative pressure conditions, can result in the chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological contamination of the potable water system (Refs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64; 65, pp. 50 and 51; 68, 71, and 72). For example, if a hose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a potable water system is left in a thawing tank with water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and frozen fish, and if negative pressure occurs that draws water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the tank back through the hose to the potable water system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both the potable water line and the water source itself, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the municipal or private water system, can become contaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Cross connections can best be controlled by performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspections of the potable and nonpotable systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These inspections should be performed at least every time that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a change in the plumbing of the systems and with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient additional frequency to ensure that unintentional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross connections do not develop. Consequently, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections be performed and documented at such frequency as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10(a)(3) to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor ensure that all food-contact surfaces are designed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed, and maintained in a manner that minimizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for chemical and microbiological contamination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Utensils and equipment can be vehicles for microbial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of both the raw and finished products. Utensils, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, and other food-contact surfaces that are made of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosive material or wood, or that contain breaks, pits, cuts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or grooves, may harbor pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the product and contaminate it. These kinds of surfaces are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to clean, with the pores and crevices shielding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms from the action of cleaning and sanitizing agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 65, pp. 20, 36&hyph;48; 72, pp. 166 and 167; and 73).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, where food-contact surfaces are constructed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic materials (e.g., lead shucking blocks), the product may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly contaminated with the toxic material (Ref. 74). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that it is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that processors take affirmative steps to minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility that any risks will be created by the utensils and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment they use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper construction of the equipment should be ensured at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time it is received, and whenever it is modified or repaired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The frequency of subsequent inspections necessary to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitary condition of the equipment has not declined with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time will depend on the frequency of its use, the materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction methods, and the nature of its use. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(c)(3) the agency is proposing to require that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls be performed and documented with such frequency as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(4), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that food-contact surfaces are regularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned and sanitized with cleaning and sanitizing preparations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are suitable for this purpose. Surfaces that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately cleaned and sanitized can be a source of filth to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent products produced on the equipment, an attractant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vermin, and a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrequent cleaning of equipment can result in the formation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biofilms, microscopic films in which microorganisms can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapped, shielded from the action of sanitizers, and physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bound to the food-contact surface of the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective cleaning compound is one that will lower the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface tension of water so that spills can be lifted and flushed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away. Ordinary soap is generally ineffective for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing because of its limited ability to solubilize fats, oils, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and proteins. Mildly alkaline detergents are generally suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cleaning seafood processing plants, but high alkaline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detergents are often necessary for heavy buildups of fats and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proteins. Mineral deposits will frequently require the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid cleaners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective sanitizing agent is one that has a good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteriocidal effect on the types of pathogens normally present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the plant environment and is safe, stable, and convenient for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. Examples include hypochlorites, iodophors, and quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds (Refs. 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To eliminate the product residue that accumulates on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product contact surfaces during production, FDA is proposing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(4)(i) to require that utensils and surfaces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that contact food during processing be thoroughly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washed at the end of the day's operations. FDA is also proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;123.10(a)(4)(iii) that sanitizing be performed on the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utensils and equipment immediately before the beginning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, so that any recontamination that occurs between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning and production can be eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(4)(ii) that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those operations in which microbiological contamination can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affect the safety of the product (e.g., the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cooked, ready-to-eat products), the equipment also be washed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitized at least every 4 hours during processing. Washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitizing with this frequency is necessary to inactivate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mesophilic pathogens, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, before they leave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lag phase of growth and enter the rapid log phase (Ref. 23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temperatures in fish and fishery product processing plants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally not low enough to control the growth of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms and are certainly not low enough to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23, 78, 79, and 80). Therefore, FDA tentatively finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing and sanitizing equipment every 4 hours is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require both cleaning and sanitizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because neither step is fully effective without the other. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing occurs without benefit of cleaning, pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms can be protected from the action of the sanitizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by food residue. Conversely, while cleaning can effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove product residue and a portion of the microorganisms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing is generally needed to remove the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms (Refs. 81 and 82). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c)(2) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor inspect the condition of the utensils and surfaces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that contact food immediately after each cleaning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the cleaning and sanitizing operations, and to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the equipment is in a condition that is suitable for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also proposing in &sect;123.10(c)(2) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor document the time of each cleaning and sanitizing, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the sanitizer, and the condition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Documentation of the time of each cleaning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing will facilitate an assessment of compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency requirement of &sect;123.10(a)(4). Documentation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the sanitizer will facilitate an assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adequacy of the sanitizing operation. Sanitizers must be of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient strength to be effective, while excessive sanitizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations can contaminate the product with indirect food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives (21 CFR part 178) (Ref. 82). Documentation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of the equipment is necessary to ensure that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined after cleaning and sanitizing to make sure that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes were done properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.10(a)(5) to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that gloves and outer garments that contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food or food-contact surfaces are made of an impermeable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material and are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gloves or aprons that are made of cloth or other porous materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are difficult to clean and may serve as a reservoir for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate to the food during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing, in much the same manner as previously described for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing equipment (Refs. 65 and 83). Gloves and aprons that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
house pathogens that can migrate to the food. Therefore, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively finds that it is appropriate to require the measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set out in &sect;123.10(a)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like most of the other sanitation measures that FDA is proposing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitary condition and impermeability of gloves and outer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garments that may contact the food or food-contact surfaces be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checked at least daily while processing operations are occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such checking will ensure that employees arriving for work are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with gloves and outer garments that will not serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of contamination to the product. It will also ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees are never using personally owned gloves and garments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are made of materials that are unsuitable for the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. Proposed &sect;123.10(c) also requires that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checking be documented on a daily basis to provide a record that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such checking has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;123.10(a)(6), the processor must ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that employees' hands, gloves, outer garments, utensils, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food-contact surfaces that come into contact with insanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objects are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before contacting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish or fishery products. Under proposed &sect;123.10(a)(7), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must also ensure that employees' hands, gloves, outer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces that contact raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before they contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees and food-contact surfaces can serve as vectors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transmission of filth and pathogenic microorganisms to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food. Filth and pathogenic microorganisms can be brought into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing environment on the employees' hands from outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, restrooms, contaminated raw materials, waste or waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receptacles, floors, and other insanitary objects (Refs. 63, 64, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
73, 74, 84, and 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bacteria naturally present on fresh fish skin and gills and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the gastrointestinal tract reflect the microbial content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water from which the fish were harvested. Typical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms found on and in fresh fish include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enteric bacteria, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, salmonella, shigella, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hepatitis A, and other microorganisms that pollute harvest waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7). These microorganisms contaminate the environment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plants and cannot, using reasonable methods, be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completely eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper precautions, such as proper hand and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning and sanitizing, must be taken to minimize opportunities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contamination of the finished product (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 84). Therefore, FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10 (a)(6) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(7) that such precautions be taken with respect to hands, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gloves, garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency recognizes that not all processing activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will require hand washing and sanitizing. Activities that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not require such steps include the handling of raw fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products prior to the initial washing step (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from the fisherman) and the handling of finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in shipping cases. These activities are exceptions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, to the general rule that employees must thoroughly wash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitize their hands after each contact with an insanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface. Additionally, when insanitary objects come into contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with product contact surfaces, they must be thoroughly cleaned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the processing of cooked products, the raw material may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also serve as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, employees or equipment that handle or touch the raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material must be cleaned and sanitized before being used with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked product or ice, or they could convey the microorganisms to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these foods (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 84, 87, and 88). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c)(1), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitary practices of the employees, especially as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relate to hand washing, sanitizing practices, and the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cross contamination, be checked and recorded at least every 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours during processing. This monitoring will ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees arriving for work and returning from the midshift break 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have properly washed and sanitized their hands. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of hand sanitizing solutions tends to be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the course of a production day because of the reaction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitizer with organic matter and dissipation as a gas (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
82). It will also cause a regular assessment of the adequacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the normal operating procedures. Finally, recording will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that appropriate procedures are being followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(8)(i), FDA is proposing to require that hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing facilities be located in all processing areas in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing and sanitizing is required by CGMP's so that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are readily accessible to employees who work in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing areas. The agency has tentatively concluded that proper sanitization is such an important part of preventing
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spread of disease as to warrant a requirement that hand washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment be conveniently located to facilitate their use. Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities are not conveniently located, they may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequented by the employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(8)(ii) that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be equipped with hand cleaning and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing preparations and single-service towels or suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand drying devices. Ordinary soap is acceptable for hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing. Hand sanitizers need to be fast acting because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short contact time involved. In contrast to the sanitizing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, which can involve leaving a sanitizing spray on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment for extended periods of time, hand sanitizing usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves a quick dip in and out of the sanitizer. Of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizers described previously (see discussion of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(4)), quaternary ammonium is not fast acting and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not suitable as a hand sanitizer. The others are appropriate as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand sanitizers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to require single-service towels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable hand drying devices to ensure that microbiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination does not occur though the repeated use of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towel by several individuals. A hot-air blower is an example of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a suitable hand drying device because contamination from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to individual is eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and documentation of the location of hand washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be performed at sufficient frequency to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is compliance with &sect;123.10(a)(8)(i). Generally, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure will be necessary only after construction or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant building or process modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor inspect, and document that it has inspected, the hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing and hand sanitizing facilities to ensure that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly equipped no less than once per day. This procedure will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that cleaning and sanitizing preparations, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towels or hand drying devices, are present whenever needed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10 (a)(9) and (a)(10) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processor protect the food, food-contact surfaces, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food packaging materials against adulteration by chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical contaminants. Such protection is necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the food produced by the processor is safe. The use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic compounds (e.g., pesticides, cleaning and sanitizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents, and lubricants) is frequently necessary in the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. For example, lubricants and fuel are necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate equipment. Improper use of these compounds is a frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause of product adulteration throughout the food industry (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74). Thus, it is necessary to ensure that food, food-contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces, and food packaging materials are not contaminated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these toxic compounds. Food and food packaging material should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be protected or removed from areas where pesticides are used, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caustic cleaning compounds should be thoroughly removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food-contact surfaces before processing begins. Finally, as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional protection, FDA is proposing to require in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(10) that toxic compounds be labeled, held, and used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the food is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected from toxic compounds, and that this inspection be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented. This check should normally be performed before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start of operations, at a time when the equipment can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively inspected, and in time to prevent adulteration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Because processing conditions vary on a day-to-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, FDA has tentatively concluded that daily inspection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(a)(11) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor ensure that products are not exposed to contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may drip, drain, or be drawn into the food. An example of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a contaminant is condensate, which may form on the ceilings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and equipment in a processing plant. If the condensate forms on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an insanitary surface and then falls on the product, it may carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with it filth and microbiological contaminants from that surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the food (Ref. 65, pp. 24 and 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such contamination is minimized, and that this inspection be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented. This check should normally be performed during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual operations, at a time when condensate or other such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminating conditions are likely to be present. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the agency has tentatively concluded that daily variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in processing and climatic conditions necessitate daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(12), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that compressed gases that contact food or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food-contact surfaces of equipment are filtered or treated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a way that the food is not contaminated with unapproved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirect food additives or other chemical, physical, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological contaminants. Compressed gases can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with oil from the compressor, filth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological contaminants from the air intake, and rust or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other physical contaminants from the compression, storage, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution equipment. Filtration at the air intake and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compression, storage, and distribution is an effective means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing the risk of such contaminants entering the food (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
89).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c)(3) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filtration and other equipment used to protect the food from such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants be inspected, and the inspection documented, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such frequency as is necessary to ensure control. Normally, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency will be directed by the manufacturer of the filtration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. FDA is not proposing to require daily inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the filter and related equipment do not normally need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning or replacement on a daily basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(13) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor take action to ensure that unprotected cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products,
raw molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, and raw fish and fishery products are physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separated from each other during refrigerated storage. Cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products are products that will not normally receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cooking by the consumer adequate enough to kill pathogens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any microbiological recontamination of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after cooking can subject the consumer to health risks. Raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish may contain pathogens that can cause severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness to certain at-risk individuals, e.g., those who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immunocompromised. These individuals might know to avoid eating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw molluscan shellfish but would not expect the same health risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from cooked, ready-to-eat products. Similarly, raw fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products may contain filth and pathogenic microorganisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not normally associated with raw molluscan shellfish or cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products (Refs. 63 and 84). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage areas be inspected at least daily to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the three types of products are physically separated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each other. This check should normally be performed during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual operations, at a time when commingling of these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to take place. The agency has tentatively concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that daily inspection is necessary because products are normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved in and out of refrigerated storage areas on a regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, creating an ongoing threat that problems will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(14) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage units operate at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when storing raw materials, in-process or finished cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products,
and fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that processors control microbiological hazards associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage for these products (Refs. 85 and 86). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooked, ready-to-eat products as defined in proposed &sect;123.3(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoked fishery products (see Appendix 1) are not shelf-stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and must be kept refrigerated to retard the growth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms. As stated above, these products will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally be cooked by the consumer at a sufficient temperature to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroy any pathogens that may be present. Scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species are addressed in considerable detail later in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document. These species can form a toxin harmful to humans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if subjected to time/temperature abuse after capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper refrigeration is essential for fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that include these species. Maintaining product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures during storage in a range that will minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of mesophilic and psychrotropic pathogens is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure product safety throughout the shelf life of these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 85). It is uniformly more convenient to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration unit temperatures than to control and monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperatures of the various products under refrigerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, particularly when these products are in sealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers. For these reasons, FDA is proposing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration units be operated at or below 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively finds that this temperature is appropriate because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is adequate to minimize the growth of pathogens (Refs. 85 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86.) The agency also strongly recommends this temperature or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower for all fish and fishery products that need refrigeration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether safety is an issue. The agency is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially interested in obtaining comment on the appropriateness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c)(4) the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor use instruments that monitor the temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration units on a continuous basis. The measurements from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those instruments must be checked and documented with such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency as is necessary to ensure control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous monitoring ensures that temperature fluctuations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), if any, as a result of circumstances such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as heavy cooler loading, frequent cooler entry, or power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures, are quickly detected. The guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, in Appendix A, section 6, describes alternative ways to continuously monitor the temperature. A temperature-recording
device can show both the high temperature and the length of time that refrigeration unit was operating at that temperature.
Maximum-indicating thermometers and high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature alarms also show that the critical limit has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded but cannot show the duration of the deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, when a maximum-indicating thermometer or high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature alarm reveals a deviation, the processor will need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume loss of control since the last time that the measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displayed by the instruments were checked, unless reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence exists to the contrary. The more frequent such checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are made, the lower the risk to which the processor is exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During periods when the refrigeration unit is not frequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered and the load is constant, such as overnight, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable to reduce the frequency. However, during periods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy use and frequent entry, the frequency should be increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(15) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor ensure that persons with sores or illnesses that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present an increased risk for product contamination are excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from those areas of processing where such contamination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely. Employees can serve as a reservoir of foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases, such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and hepatitis, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be passed on to the consumer through the fecal-oral route. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, open sores, boils, or infected wounds present the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for contamination of the food with such pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus aureus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspicious illnesses or sores can be effectively screened upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrival at the processing facility with minimal personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrusion (Refs. 22, 74, and 84). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening, and documentation of the screening, take place daily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This frequency will ensure that changing health conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees are not missed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(16), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that toilet facilities are available and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities provide for proper disposal of the sewage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toilet facilities eliminate from the processing environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenic microorganisms shed in fecal material. Where fecal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material is not properly conveyed from the processing plant to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable treatment facility, restroom floors and grounds around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing facility can become contaminated with pathogens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foot traffic over the affected areas can introduce pathogens to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing room and cause product contamination. Insanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toilet facilities can also increase the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of employees' hands and, ultimately, the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 64 and 74). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(c) that the toilet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be inspected, and the inspection be documented, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that they function properly and are in a sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition at least every day. Ordinarily this inspection should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be performed before each day's operation to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is ready at the beginning of the day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(17), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that no pests are present in the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. Pests, such as rodents, birds, and insects carry a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of human disease agents, which they can introduce to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing environment (Refs. 63, 64, 73, and 84). Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their feces constitutes filth which can contaminate the food. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily inspection of the processing facility, as proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(c), serves to assess the effectiveness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's pest control activities and redirect them where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(18), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that the plant is designed to minimize risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of contamination of the food. Proper construction is essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the other sanitary measures that FDA is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are to be successful. It includes the isolation of incompatible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, such as the handling of raw materials and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of cooked products (Refs. 71, 74, 87, and 88). A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspection of the facility for structural defects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product flow, and general building condition is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that these attributes do not pose an increased potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for product contamination. In &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that such controls be performed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented with sufficient frequency to ensure control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(b) that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain sanitation control records that document the occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and findings of the inspections required by &sect;123.10(a) as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the frequency required by &sect;123.10(c). FDA is also proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require that the problems found during these inspections be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, and the corrections recorded in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.10(d). Such corrections are essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper working of the HACCP system. The records that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8, including being subject to inspection by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls, including recordkeeping, will ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards caused by insanitation are controlled by design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recordkeeping is the key to an HACCP-type system. The agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to these records is essential to ensuring that the system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is working. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these proposed requirements, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraging processors in &sect;123.10(e) to have a written standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating procedure for sanitation. The details of many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation procedures can differ from plant to plant depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the type of operation and other conditions. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how a piece of equipment should be cleaned can differ from plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to plant. In one plant, it may be necessary to disassemble all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or part of the equipment in order to clean it. In other plants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaking down the equipment may not be necessary. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different cleaning compounds may be needed from one plant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another in order to solve specialized problems such as buildups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of mineral deposits. FDA is therefore encouraging each processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to study its own plant and develop a procedure that is tailored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that processor's needs and circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Evisceration of Raw Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, following botulism outbreaks traced to consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of kapchunka, FDA published compliance policy guide (CPG) 7108.17 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for salt-cured, air-dried, uneviscerated fish (53 FR 44949 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 7, 1988). In this CPG, FDA stated that the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sale of smoked and salted uneviscerated fish products pose a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential health hazard, and that it would consider such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act in that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
175). FDA issued this CPG in an effort to prevent further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outbreaks, as well as other potential health hazards, related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consumption of ungutted fish products. The agency recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only two exceptions: (1) Small species, such as anchovies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herring pieces (sprats), provided that they are processed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method that will ensure a water-phase salt content of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent, a water activity below 0.85, or a pH of 4.6 or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) fish that are fully cooked before further processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously noted, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms, are naturally present in the intestinal tract of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both fresh-water fish and marine fish. Therefore, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential not only to remove the viscera but to do so in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that does not contaminate the fish flesh with viscera contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the viscera that can contain the majority of the hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose the potential health hazard (Refs. 165 through 167). After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the viscera is removed, it must be discarded immediately to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segregated area, using a method that minimizes the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination or cross-contamination of utensils, equipment, raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, and other processed products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uneviscerated fish that have been smoked, smoke-flavored, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salted, and that are intended to be filleted after processing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose the same potential health hazard as those products sold as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uneviscerated whole fish. The potential health hazard is created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the viscera is removed after processing. As the fish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being filleted, the viscera may be cut, and its contents may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spill out, contaminating the processed fish. As a result, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity arises for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spore outgrowth and toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production as well as for growth of other food spoilage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms in these types of products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, subject to the same limitations that were set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPG: (1) All fish for smoking or salting be eviscerated prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to processing, and (2) the process of evisceration must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed in an area that is segregated and separate from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing operations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, imports make up over half of the seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed in this country, in sharp contrast to meat and poultry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are primarily domestically produced. Many of the hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can affect imported seafood are likely to occur before it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters the United States. These hazards include those that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be acquired from the environment before harvest and those that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are process-induced. Detection of these hazards is the focus of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current regulatory system, and thus FDA tries to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by testing imported product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, product testing places a substantial burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. The system currently is overburdened because of limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the number of government personnel available to collect and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze samples of imported product. In addition, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned because this system does not promote industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and accountability the way an HACCP-based problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention system would. Given when most problems with imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood occur, these problems can be more efficiently controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the seafood is subject to HACCP controls before it is offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for import into this country than if the product is simply tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time that it is offered for sale. Therefore, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concluded that these HACCP regulations should cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported products in the same manner, to the extent possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they cover domestic products.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, FDA is proposing to make importers subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general provisions of subpart A. Thus, FDA is proposing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.11(a) to require that products that are offered for import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be produced under the same HACCP and sanitation controls that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing to apply to domestically produced seafood. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that importers adopt an HACCP plan that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the criteria for how they will decide to purchase and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then handle seafood while it is under their control. They must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also establish ways to determine that these requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specifically, the plan must include hazard analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points, and critical limits for each type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product imported as well as a copy of each supplier's HACCP plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those products, as required in &sect;123.11(b). Under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.11(b), these plans must be available on file at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer's U.S. place of business. As stated above, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is developing a hazard analysis book to assist importers, as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as processors, in designing their individual plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the proposed requirement of &sect;123.11(b) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers must have on file an HACCP plan from each of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign suppliers, foreign processors who wish to offer their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for import into the United States after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of this regulation will have to operate under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid HACCP plans and sanitation control procedures and furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of those plans to the U.S. importers. The foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors should maintain appropriate monitoring records, as dictated by the principles of HACCP already discussed.
These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records should be kept at the foreign processors' places of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importers will be required under proposed &sect;123.11(c) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take affirmative steps to monitor that their suppliers are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact operating under their HACCP plans. Thus, under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, the importer will need to take such steps as: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obtaining records from the foreign processors' facilities; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining certification from foreign governments that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers are operating under valid HACCP plans or obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification lot by lot; (3) visiting the facilities to inspect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them on a regular basis; or (4) taking some similar type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, e.g., end product testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, importers of swordfish may specify to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers that the mercury level in the swordfish that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase cannot exceed FDA's action level of 1 part per million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methyl mercury. The importers may decide to require certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of analysis for methyl mercury on a regular basis from their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers as a means of ensuring that the swordfish that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer for import into the United States is not adulterated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 123.11(d) provides an option for those importing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a country that has an active memorandum of understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MOU) or similar agreement with FDA. If the MOU is current, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if there is equivalency between the inspection system of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign country and the U.S. system, the importer will be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rely on the MOU in lieu of the actions required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.11(c). An active MOU must accurately reflect the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation between the signing parties and be functioning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable in its entirety. It is the importer's responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether the MOU is in fact active, and whether it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covers the products that the importer intends to receive from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency strongly encourages importers (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in proposed &sect;123.11(e)) to require their suppliers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain HACCP training such as is required in &sect;123.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.12 provides that there must be evidence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood offered for import has been produced in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 123, subpart A. As stated previously, FDA is including this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to ensure that there is equivalent treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported and domestic products. FDA can ensure that domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is being produced in accordance with the HACCP plan and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitation controls in &sect;123.10 through direct observation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and review of records. Similar inspection of foreign processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be prohibitively expensive. However, FDA tentatively finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that mere reliance on the existence of an HACCP plan is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough, and that additional evidence of compliance must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided. FDA tentatively finds that this evidence can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the means listed in proposed &sect;123.12(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the ways that the agency contemplates obtaining this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence would be by inspecting, at the importers' U.S. place of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, the importers' and foreign suppliers' HACCP plans, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation procedures, and records associated with the importers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans. If these records demonstrate that the foreign processor and the importer are operating in accordance with
adequate HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans, agency will have assurance that the food is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also intends to pursue MOU's with countries that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that their inspection systems are and continue to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially equivalent to those in the United States (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.12(a)(2)). The existence of an active MOU between FDA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the country of origin covering the seafood products being offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for import will provide assurance that these products covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MOU are being produced under appropriate conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is no MOU, the agency will take into consideration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of verifying the compliance of imported seafood, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge that a foreign country has an advanced seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection system that provides for plans that are HACCP based, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided in proposed &sect;123.12(a)(3). The existence of such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory system and its enforcement will provide assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the conditions under which products exported from that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country are being produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.12(a)(4) provides that inspection of foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors by the agency or other organization designated by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may also be used to establish compliance with these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency intends to use other measures as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds appropriate to make determinations about the acceptability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product being offered for import, including but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to end product testing, as in proposed &sect;123.12(a)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If assurances do not exist, as described in &sect;123.12(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the product has been produced under an HACCP plan and under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation controls that are equivalent to those required of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domestic processors, the agency will deny entry to the products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Raw Molluscan Shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in part 123, subpart C that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors of raw molluscan shellfish include in their HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans how they control the origin of the molluscan shellfish that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they process. Proposed &sect;123.28 requires that these controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include obtaining raw shellfish only from approved growing waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through harvesters or processors licensed by a shellfish control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. FDA is proposing to require that processors maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records to document that each lot of raw molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets these requirements. Under this proposal, these records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will constitute HACCP records subject to the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also proposing to establish a system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tagging or other labeling that provides information about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin of all shellstock and shucked molluscan shellfish received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a processor. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;1240.60 (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1240.60) to provide for such a tagging system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raw molluscan shellfish are molluscan shellfish that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been subject to a treatment sufficient to kill pathogens of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health significance. Shellfish that have been subjected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any form of treatment, such as steam, hot water, or dry heat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a short period of time before shucking to facilitate removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the meat from the shell are still considered to be raw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Molluscan shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unique public health risks. They probably cause the majority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all seafood-related illnesses in the United States (Refs. 6; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7, p. 330). The safety of raw molluscan shellfish directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the cleanliness of its aquatic environment. Of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edible species of fish, molluscan shellfish are unique in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are nonmotile, filter feeding organisms. They pump large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities of water through their bodies during the normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feeding process (Refs. 7, p. 331; and 90, p. c-4). The positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between harvesting areas contaminated by sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution and shellfish-borne enteric disease has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated many times (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91 and 92). During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feeding, the shellfish may concentrate pathogenic microorganisms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadly toxins associated with naturally occurring marine plankton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 93), or forms of agricultural and industrial pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 94). Among the pathogenic microorganisms is the Norwalk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virus, probably the most common cause of seafood-borne illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This virus commonly occurs in waters contaminated by sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91, 92, and 95). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the adoption of the current public health controls in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States, shellfish commonly transmitted many serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicable diseases. Consumption of raw or undercooked seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from polluted waters can be a mode of transmission for typhoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fever, infectious hepatitis, and cholera (Ref. 67). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases are still commonly associated with raw shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption in lesser developed countries (Ref. 7, p. 73). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the incidence of these diseases in the United States has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been largely controlled under section 361 of the PHS Act (42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 264). This statute was enacted to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under provisions of the PHS Act, FDA is empowered to accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from the States to protect public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FDA participates in a Federal/State cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program called NSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Established in 1925, the NSSP provides water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for assessing the safety of shellfish growing areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These criteria are applied by the States under the authority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own laws. The NSSP ``Manual of Operations'' provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis (Refs. 90 and 96) for State regulation in 23 shellfish-producing States and 6 nations. Each participating State
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nation classifies and monitors its shellfish growing waters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls harvesting, inspects shellfish packing and shucking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, and issues certificates to individual shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors that meet the State or foreign government's shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control criteria.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist themselves in the implementation of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish laws, the States have formed the ISSC. The ISSC is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization of State officials, representatives of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, and representatives of the shellfish industry. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides guidance to the States and provides a forum for them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss their problems in attempting to ensure the sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of shellfish handling and production (Ref. 97, p. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA evaluates State and international shellfish sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs (Ref. 98, part I, p. 2). When it finds that the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with the NSSP, FDA accepts the State's or country's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipper certifications. FDA publishes the ``Interstate Certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shellfish Shippers List'' monthly, in which it lists the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 2,000 shellfish dealers that have been certified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FDA continues to believe in the cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partnership that it has established with the States, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that this system is not protecting the public health as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as it might (Refs. 7, p. 331; 99, p. iii; and 100). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Problems can originate anywhere. As explained in the discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above of the term ``lot of molluscan shellfish,'' the water from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which shellfish are harvested plays a significant role in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining their safety. If they are harvested from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unclassified or polluted waters, shellfish can be a vector of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicable disease. Problems can also occur as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which the shellfish are held on the harvest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel, in the processing plant, or by subsequent handlers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repackers of shucked products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the current situation, FDA has tentatively determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is necessary for it to take steps to strengthen and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide additional support for the existing cooperative program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA is proposing two measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, FDA is proposing to add &sect;1240.60(b), which will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that all shellfish offered for transport or transported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interstate commerce bear a tag that lists the date, place, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type, and quantity of shellfish, and by whom it was harvested, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the harvester's identification number. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing this requirement because it has determined that a tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the only means by which the agency can ensure that it will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible to determine whether the shellfish have been taken from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe water. FDA is proposing to require that the place where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish were harvested be listed because it will enable a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor who receives the shellfish, or a regulatory official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who inspects them, to determine whether they were taken from safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require that the date when the shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were harvested be listed because, as discussed above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shifting conditions in shellfish harvesting waters make shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety virtually a day-to-day proposition. Therefore, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish are harvested becomes a critical factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing that the type of shellfish e.g., oysters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clams, mussels, or scallops, and quantity be shown on the tag or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bill of lading to ensure that the tag is applied only to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to which it was initially affixed. Information on type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quantity of shellfish describes that product. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that the person by whom the shellfish were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested be listed because that person has the most direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge of where and when the shellfish were harvested and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be readily identifiable in case there are problems with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shellfish, so that quick action can be taken to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of any problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, FDA is proposing that the harvester identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number issued by the shellfish control authority be included to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a means to confirm the harvester's identity and to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvester's local address in case of an illness investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or followup to tagging and labeling discrepancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing this tagging requirement under section 361 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the PHS Act. Under this section, the Surgeon General and, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegation, FDA, is authorized to make and enforce such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as in FDA's judgment are necessary to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA tentatively finds that requiring a tag is a measure necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent the spread of communicable diseases because the tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will readily permit identification of those raw shellfish that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were harvested from properly classified waters, and thus that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be vectors of communicable disease in interstate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce, and those that were not harvested from properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified waters and thus that may be vectors of disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the PHS Act, FDA is also authorized to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such measures which in its judgment may be necessary to enforce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations that it adopts to prevent the spread of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicable diseases (section 361(a) of the PHS Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing to provide in &sect;1240.60(b) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seizure and destruction of any shellfish that are not properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tagged. Without the assurances provided by the tag, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish may bear a microorganism that may render them injurious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to health. Thus, they are unfit for consumption and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the food supply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that all shellfish-producing States have laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require the tagging of shellfish. This proposal is intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to support those laws, not supersede them. The proposed tagging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is necessary for two reasons. First, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that untagged shellfish come from safe waters. Illegal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting of molluscan shellfish from contaminated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unclassified waters is known to occur (Ref. 7, p. 331). It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also known that illegally harvested shellfish find their way into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial channels. States and FDA find untagged or improperly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tagged shellfish during their inspections of shellfish processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the cooperative program (Refs. 101 through 109). FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently lacks a basis for taking action against untagged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish (Ref. 110). Proposed &sect;1240.60 will provide a basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, State tagging requirements and sanctions are not uniform, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the sanctions provided under some State laws have little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterrent effect (Refs. 102, 103, and 109). The establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Federal sanction will provide illegal harvesters with sure knowledge that if their catch enters interstate commerce
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comes to the attention of FDA, it will be destroyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If &sect;1240.60(b) is adopted, as a practical matter, product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification will begin at the harvesting site. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend &sect;1240.60 to require that the first handler of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live molluscan shellfish, be it the licensed harvester, licensed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculturist, or certified shellfish shipper, affix a tag to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each container of shellfish. The tag will then provide the means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to ensure that the shellfish that they buy is from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly classified water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the tag will provide all information that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to trace the product to its source, e.g., date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest, location of harvest, quantity and type of shellfish, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvester's name and identification number assigned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish control authority. The product traceability that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results will enhance epidemiological investigations in the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of shellfish-borne illness. It will also facilitate prompt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedial actions necessary to reestablish public health controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety concerns about shucked molluscan shellfish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially the same as those discussed above for in-shell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish. Because shucked shellfish are packaged in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container that can be labeled, the agency is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;1240.60(c) that for these shellfish, a label may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted that bears information equivalent to that found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tag. Another reason for allowing labeling in lieu of a tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the fact that one bag of unshucked molluscan shellfish bearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single tag can typically be processed into more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container of shucked molluscan shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second measure that FDA is proposing is based on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience with the NSSP and the ISSC. FDA has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the system for protecting the safety of shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be significantly strengthened if the agency were to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that certain limited steps be taken as part of the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that are intended for interstate commerce. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that these measures, like the proposed tagging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, will serve to strengthen the Federal-State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperative program as well as the shellfish safety programs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the States and countries that participate in NSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the pathogens in shellfish, such as the Norwalk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virus, are virtually undetectable. Moreover, from a technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and practical perspective, end product testing cannot be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of shellfish to ensure that they are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with one of the myriad of possible domestic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial, and agricultural contaminants that have been found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish harvesting areas. Therefore, State classification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing waters is a necessary first step to ensure the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish. These classifications, as detailed in NSSP, address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all actual and potential pollutants in deciding whether an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is suitable for harvesting (Ref. 90, pp. c&hyph;5 and c&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.28(a) that each processor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish have an HACCP plan that ensures that the molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that it processes come only from areas that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified by a shellfish control authority as satisfactory for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting. As noted above, the safety of molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed raw or partly cooked is predicated on the cleanliness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growing area waters from which they are obtained. Ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that shellfish come from properly classified growing areas is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where shellfish safety begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;123.28(b), processors are to process only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that originate from growing waters that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for harvesting by a shellfish control authority as shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by product tags or labels with specific information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes that they were harvested from appropriate waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing this requirement under both section 361 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHS Act, to prevent the spread of communicable disease, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 402(a)(1), 402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the act to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the food does not contain any added substances that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
render it injurious to health and is not prepared, packed, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held under insanitary conditions whereby it may be rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injurious to health.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;123.28(b)(2) and (b)(3), the shellstock tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a licensed harvester or certified processor, or the bill of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lading accompanying bulk shipments, will contain the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under proposed &sect;1240.60(b) and thus document whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shellfish are from an acceptable source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirement &sect;123.28(b) that only shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drawn from such acceptable sources can be processed will place a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium on properly tagged products from shellfish dealers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States or nations that participate in NSSP have certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is further proposing to require in &sect;123.28(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that shucked products be subject to the same requirements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to shellstock. FDA is doing so because the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shucked shellfish products, like shellstock, depends on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the water where they are grown. Therefore, the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is further proposing to require in &sect;123.28(d) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor maintain records that document that each lot of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish meets the tagging or labeling requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.28 (b) or (c) (see Refs. 104 and 108). The information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require to be maintained in records simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects these requirements. Permanent records are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that processors are controlling the origin of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish they process. In addition, permanent records will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate epidemiological investigations by allowing complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product traceability to the source of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protection of shellfish consumers also requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domestic and imported products be treated equally. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported raw molluscan shellfish are subject to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards as domestic shellfish with regard to adulteration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranding, Federal law does not require that imported shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
come from waters that were classified by a public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. This double standard is unfair to domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors, and both ISSC and industry representatives have urged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government to address this problem (Refs. 111 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112). While virtually all States have chosen to reject imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that are not tagged as coming from classified waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 113), it is known that such shellfish nonetheless enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce (Ref. 107). Untagged imports originating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from uncertified producers compromise the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood safety programs (Ref. 7, p. 73) and product traceability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing that all raw shellfish products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either from domestic or foreign origin must comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in part 123 and &sect;1240.60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, if &sect;123.28(b), for example, is adopted, it will mean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that only those molluscan shellfish that are harvested in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign country that has a program that incorporates the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures set out in the NSSP for approving growing waters will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for processing. Such a program will need to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures that provide for water classification, monitoring, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other related activities if it is to ensure that the growing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters that it approves are safe, and thus that the shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are drawn from such waters are not adulterated. FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that the best way to establish that a foreign country's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program meets this standard is through the development of an MOU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the agency and that country. Currently, such agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist with Australia, Canada, Chile, England, Iceland, Japan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Republic of Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FDA anticipates that these proposed requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will improve the safety of raw molluscan shellfish by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing uniform requirements for domestic and imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and prohibiting interstate movement of shellfish that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not properly tagged to demonstrate that it came from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate harvesting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effectiveness of State shellfish sanitation programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NSSP will be strengthened by the proposed mandatory tagging, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling, and recordkeeping requirements, which will allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete product traceability to its source of origin. Should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses occur, product traceability will facilitate a rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of when a problem occurred and allow immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedial actions to restore public health controls. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring proper tagging or labeling will place a premium on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and foreign shellfish sanitation and processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Guideline for Cooked, Ready-to-Eat Fishery Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix A for cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat fishery products. These products possess an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevated microbiological risk relative to most other seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products because they are cooked as part of processing and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally receive any additional cooking by consumers before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption. Consequently, to be safe, these products must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essentially pathogen-free by the time they leave the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Immediate refrigeration at proper temperatures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the growth of pathogens is also essential for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, which are not shelf-stable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline addresses critical control points that apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these products as a class and that thus will typically be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the HACCP plans of most processors of cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products. The guideline also addresses ways of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling hazards at each critical control point. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cooked, ready-to-eat products that are also smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products should apply the controls
set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix 1. If FDA adopts that regulation, it will codify it in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserved subpart B of part 123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This guideline is not relevant to most of the cooked, ready-to-eat products that are processed as low acid canned foods
under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 113. However, the recommendations in Appendix A, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. a., b., and d. for cooling, processing after cooking, and refrigerated storage, will apply to those low acid canned
foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are cooked, processed, and then cooked again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline provides information on how to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
during the processing step between cooks. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also addresses the control of microbiological hazards that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur within the processing environment for cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. It does not address nonprocessing hazards, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are not relevant to this class of products. FDA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish separate guidance that will, among other things, address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprocessing hazards. Likewise, this guideline will not address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nonsafety hazards, such as decomposition that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with human illness and economic adulteration, that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has suggested in proposed &sect;123.6(c) should be covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plan. These hazards will also be covered in the separately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published guidance. Economic adulteration, for example, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed in Appendix D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively decided to address the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls for cooked, ready-to-eat products in a guideline, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than by regulation, to permit flexibility in the face of changing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing technologies and knowledge. As stated earlier in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble, the guidelines are intended to advise processors about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what FDA believes will be acceptable in a HACCP plan. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges, however, that there are basic processing norms to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which conscientious processors adhere, and that these norms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not likely to change for the foreseeable future. FDA therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on whether any or all of the guideline on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products ought to be codified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in part 123 if it is adopted as a final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Thermal Processing: Cooking and Pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processes and Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed guideline in Appendix A, section 4 advises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors on how to ensure that: (1) Their cooking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) their cooking and pasteurization equipment is adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to deliver their cooking and pasteurization processes. A cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is, in essence, the temperature and time at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature that will both kill pathogens and create a marketable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. A pasteurization process is the temperature and time at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature that is necessary to reduce the numbers of pathogens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the point where they will not cause harm over the shelf life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a refrigerated product. It is essential that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
type E not survive the pasteurization process for cooked, ready-to-eat products that are packed in hermetically
sealed containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and held at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 52). Such containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are typically vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged and thus can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a good environment for the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
type E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet the requirements in part 123, subpart A, processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have assurance that their cooking and pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens and must document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this assurance in their HACCP records. This approach is similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that in the regulations for low acid canned foods, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that processors of those products know that their thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes are adequate to destroy 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

. The low acid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canned food regulations do not specify to processors what their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature parameters must be in order to destroy those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens. There are simply too many variables and possibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to thermal processing parameters for this kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specificity in those regulations to be practical or appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, the regulations require that processors use a thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that is at least equivalent to one established by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authority, i.e., a third party who has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise to determine the parameters of a thermal process that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will destroy pathogens (Ref. 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach has served the consuming public, the agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the industry well over the years. FDA is therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending in proposed Appendix A, section 4. a.1. and b.1. that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors utilize the services of process authorities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the parameters of their cooking and pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A process authority could be a private individual, a member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of academia, or an agency of government. Processors can find 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authorities through their trade associations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local Sea Grant extension offices, or State universities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures that are used in establishing a cooking or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process should be generally recognized and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted. Such procedures may include thermal death time, heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetration, and inoculated pack studies, as necessary, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the minimum process necessary to destroy pathogens. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases where the cooking process or pasteurization process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized and not unique to a specific processor, articles in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
journals; Federal, State, or local regulations and guidelines; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other appropriate vehicles could provide process parameters (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52). Whatever the source, processors must retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation from the process authority that the process will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as part of their HACCP records, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process established by a process authority should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include values for those aspects of the process that can affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the destruction of pathogens. The most notable of these are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking times and temperatures. Others may include the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of the cooking medium before the cooking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product size and species, and the viscosity of formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products such as soups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is already aware that the cooking processes necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create a marketable product for several types of cooked, ready-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to-eat products are many times more lethal than necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inactivate pathogens (Ref. 114). The products are the several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of crabs listed in the guidelines at proposed Appendix A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4.a.4. FDA has tentatively concluded that, for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, the adequacy of both the cooking process and cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment can be assumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is likely that other products could be added to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list. The agency invites comments on this point. Comments should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accompanied by data that will enable the agency to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the minimum cooking process necessary to achieve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketable product, e.g., heat penetration data and data on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of cooking processes (times and temperatures) applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that product, will produce a safe product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same general principles also apply to the design of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking and pasteurization equipment. It is necessary that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment be designed and operated so that every unit of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives the established minimum cooking or pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process proposed (Appendix A, section 4. a.2. and b.2.) (Ref. 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recommends that the equipment be evaluated for design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation by a process authority who is familiar with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamics of temperature distribution in processing equipment. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some instances, temperature distribution studies may be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing literature should be sufficient. Processors must obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retain documentation that the equipment will provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum process as part of their HACCP records in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.8.

2. Container Integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed guidelines advise in Appendix A, section 3. c. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and d. that HACCP plans prepared in accordance with part 123, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A will normally identify finished product container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealing for pasteurized products and postpasteurizing cooling as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points. Contamination with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
type E 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the postpasteurization cooling step is a special food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety hazard that must be controlled for pasteurized products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two potential causes of recontamination are poor container seams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and contaminated cooling water. Consequently, the guidelines, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 5, recommend controls that processors can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilize that are likely to meet the requirements of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 5.a. advises processors how to inspect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product containers of pasteurized products for container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity to ensure a consistently reliable hermetic seal. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Appendix A, section 5.b., the guidelines advise about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for the presence of sanitizer in cooling water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seam inspections should determine whether the seams conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the manufacturer's guidelines. Additionally, because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variations from seaming head to seaming head, from closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine to closing machine, and over time for any one machine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
head, FDA recommends that processors conduct inspections for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine and head at least every 4 hours. Visual seam inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not adequate to fully assess the integrity of the seam. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Physical testing and, in the case of double seams, seam teardown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and measurement, are necessary parts of the inspection, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presently required for low acid canned foods in part 113. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presence of sanitizer in cooling water provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control for the risk of microbiologically contaminated water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being drawn into the can. A vacuum created by a collapse in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling vat of the steam head in the container, generated during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the heating step, can draw in a minute amount of cooling water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and any pathogens contained in that cooling water. Seams are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a particularly stressed condition at that time. Sanitizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strength levels should be checked periodically because there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendency for variation in strength to occur, particularly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batch-type systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Time and Temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines advise, in proposed Appendix A, section 3. e., f., g., and h., that HACCP plans prepared in accordance
with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A of part 123 will normally identify cooling after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking, processing after cooking, final product cooling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage, as critical control points. The potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists for some pathogenic microorganisms to survive the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, regardless of the controls that are in place at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
step. Likewise, despite a processor's efforts to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recontamination of the cooked product with pathogens, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential exists for some pathogens to be reintroduced. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reasons, it is imperative that exposure of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the cooking process to temperatures that permit the growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of pathogens be kept to a minimum, since larger numbers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently associated with a greater potential for disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To control hazards as required by part 123, subpart A, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process must take steps to restrict time/temperature abuse of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked product to the point that pathogens such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spp. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
do not enter the rapid (logarithmic) phase of growth. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricting pathogen growth to the slow (lag) phase, pathogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers should remain constant or increase only slightly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Appendix A, section 6.a. provides a way to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growth of pathogens immediately after cooking. It advises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, after cooking, the product should be cooled from 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) within two hours. This time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination is based on the upper limit for growth (i.e., 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the lower limit for rapid growth (i.e., 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mesophilic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical length of the lag phase for the former microorganism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 23, 85, and 115). However, 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) will not fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control the growth of psychrotrophic pathogens. Consequently, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further cooling from 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) within 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional hours is advisable, based on the minimum growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the lag time of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 23, 78, and 79). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These cooling recommendations are generally consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of USDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 115) and the National Food Processors Association (NFPA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 78). FDA invites comments on the specifics in App. A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6.a. In those instances where further processing takes place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the achievement of the 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or the 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) temperatures, further reduction in temperature need not take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. There is no need for production delays when in-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage times are normally less than the 2 or 6 hours needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve each of these temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time/temperature parameters employed to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological hazards associated with cooling after cooking can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring (Appendix A, section 6.a.1.). Real time documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this monitoring should be done to facilitate management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternately, the ability of the firm's processing procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consistently achieve the appropriate time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing variations include product size, e.g., the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp sizes that the firm typically processes; the temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cooling medium, e.g., the highest temperature normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced in the firm's cooling unit; and the amount of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally placed in the cooling unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances in-process time/temperature monitoring may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be impractical or needlessly redundant, particularly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous processing systems. A scientifically conducted study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is especially appropriate for such situations, where it can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assured that in all plausible situations the time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters will be met. Documentation and retention of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct and results of this study is required by &sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 6.b. advises how processors can ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that microbiological hazards associated with postcooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing can be controlled. It advises that products not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 4 hours during postcooking processing, again based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency recognizes that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many products, manipulation of the product after cooking, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undesirable from the standpoint of microbiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recontamination, is necessary for many cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. It is often impractical to perform this manipulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under refrigerated conditions. Consequently, the product will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to some combination of time and temperature that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for microbiological growth. The recommended conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will minimize the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of heat stable toxins (e.g., staphylococcal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enterotoxin). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of the firm's processing procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed by monitoring the length of time that the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to such ambient temperatures. Documentation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature monitoring must be in accordance with &sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to facilitate management and regulatory review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A, section 6.c. advises how processors can ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that microbiological hazards associated with final product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling can be controlled. Following the manipulation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product during postcooking processing, it will be necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor to cool the product to a temperature that will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the further growth of mesophilic or psychrotropic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens. This result can be achieved by cooling the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to an internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) within 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of either placing it in the finished product container or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing pasteurization. Again, the recommendation is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Of specific concern to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process is the reduction of the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the product to a level that will not support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of any surviving spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, type E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of the firm's processing procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to address the particulars of the firm's processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Real time documentation of this monitoring should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done to facilitate management and regulatory review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternately, the firm's ability to consistently meet its

parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these processing variations include container size, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the cooling medium, and the amount of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally placed in the cooling unit. In many instances, in-process time/temperature monitoring may be impractical
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive for sealed finished product containers. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically conducted study is especially appropriate in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations, where it can be assured that in all plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations the time/temperature constraints will be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation of the conduct and results of the study is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under proposed &sect;123.8 to facilitate management and regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temperature control during refrigerated storage is best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved through the use of temperature indicating and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices and recordkeeping, as stated in Appendix A, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.d.2. (Ref. 85). However, FDA recognizes that some processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may desire to manually monitor the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration unit, using only a temperature-indicating device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a logbook. When coupled with a high temperature alarm or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum-indicating thermometer, the agency feels that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice represents an acceptable alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline advises, in Appendix A, section 3.i., that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans prepared in accordance with subpart A of part 123 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will normally identify distribution as a critical control point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution of perishable products encompasses the same hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as associated with refrigerated storage. For this reason, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 6.e., the agency is recommending a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit of an internal temperature maximum of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraging the shipper and consignee to arrange for appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that distribution patterns vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerably from single shipments to pooled and multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery shipments, from iced shipments to refrigerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments, and from shipments on the consignee's truck to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments on the shipper's truck to common carrier shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each mode presents different opportunities and impediments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Temperature Monitoring Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors must monitor and control the temperature of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration units in order to ensure that microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern do not increase in numbers. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors must control the times and temperatures of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal processes in order to ensure that the minimum thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is consistently delivered to the product. The guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the outfitting of cooking, pasteurization, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration equipment with temperature indicating and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices (Appendix A, sections 4. a.2.ii. and b.2.ii., and section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.d.2., respectively). A temperature-recording device provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete history of the temperature throughout the thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process by continuously recording it on a chart. As has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated for low acid canned foods, the chart itself provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an excellent HACCP record for the benefit of both processor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulator. For this record to be meaningful, it is critical that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temperature-recording device sensor be installed so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately represent the temperature of the heating or cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred and rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccurate. They can be calibrated and corrected against a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device (e.g., a thermometer) quite easily, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however. Processors should do so at least at the beginning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of each production day in order to determine whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument was accurate throughout the day's production. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation, the temperature-indicating device serves as reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument since it is much more reliable. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device should never show a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature than the temperature-indicating device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Temperature-indicating devices are generally reliable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need only be calibrated upon installation and annually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereafter. Calibration should be against a standardized (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traceable to the National Bureau of Standards) thermometer that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not subject to the rigors of the processing environment (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85). Temperature-indicating devices must often be read under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than ideal plant conditions, so they should be installed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a location that facilitates easy reading. As with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device, the sensor on the temperature-indicating device should be installed so as to accurately

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the temperature of the heating or cooling medium.

Appendix A, section 8. advises processors about corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action steps that they should consider to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed corrective action requirements in &sect;123.7 of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the evaluation of critical limit failures relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking step and the terminal heat treatment step of cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products may well require an understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical aspects of thermal process calculations, Appendix A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 8. recommends additional controls to those required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.7 in this regard. Of primary importance is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation that any corrective action other than processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to eliminate the hazard or destruction must be assessed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authority. For this purpose, a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority may be a representative of the firm or may be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside source, so long as the process authority has a scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background that is adequate to make the assessment.

6. Sanitary Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 123.10 of subpart A establishes requirements for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors for sanitation within the processing environment. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to these requirements, this guideline recommends in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 8. that processors of cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products establish sanitary zones in their facilities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency invites comments on the merits of this concept and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it should be codified in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The importance of good sanitation in the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products cannot be overemphasized. While, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as has been stated earlier, plant sanitation has no real bearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on human food safety for many foods, the safety of cooked, ready-to-eat products can be easily jeopardized by pathogens
that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced through poor sanitation practices. Consequently, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is recommending that processors establish sanitary zones around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas where products that have already been cooked are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled or stored. The primary purpose of a sanitary zone is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically separate insanitary objects from cooked products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanitary zones can also minimize the likelihood of airborne contamination through proper filtration and positive
air pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A sanitary zone is a separation of operations by location, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partition, air flow, or enclosed systems. In most cases, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires procedural changes to minimize the risk of contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not large-scale structural changes. Canada has successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated the concept of sanitary zones for seafood processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of its HACCP-based inspection program (Ref. 116).

K. Guideline For Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix B for handling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species in which scombroid toxin can form. This problem is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily, but not exclusively, associated with members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family Scombridae. The fish involved contain significant levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of naturally occurring free histidine in their flesh, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain bacteria can decarboxylate into histamine. Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine levels occur when the fish are exposed after death to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times and temperatures that permit the growth of these bacteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Histamine can result in a mild to severe allergic response in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans. Scombrotoxin poisoning is one of the three most common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-related illnesses (Ref. 5, p. 24). The scombrotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species that have been associated with foodborne illness include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuna, bluefish, mahi, mackerel, sardines, herring, kahawai, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchovies, and marlin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This HACCP guidance is intended to maximize the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls to ensure proper handling of scombrotoxic species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus to minimize the possibility of a problem. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes the often complex pathways of movement and ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through which such fish may pass. Failure to ensure safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling at any point in the chain may render the fish injurious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 There is a basis for concern about the safety of the fish as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soon as histamine begins to form. Once the histamine-forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process has begun, it is like a chain reaction. Lowering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of, or freezing, the fish will slow or arrest the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, but only cooking and prevention of recontamination can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stop it (Refs. 9 and 117). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline describes a HACCP system that emphasizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliance upon accurate recordkeeping to show continuity of proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling. Accurate knowledge of the time/temperature history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish is very important in determining the likelihood that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are unsafe or may become unsafe. The guideline also calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more stringent processor controls to be applied to lots for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which records are inadequate. While this guideline is designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent problems, nothing in it should be construed as meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the agency will not take regulatory action if it finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposed fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline in Appendix B, section 2. identifies receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw materials, which include imported shipments, as a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point for processors of scombroid toxin forming species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Time/temperature abuse by the fisherman can result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition and the resultant production of histamine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decomposition can also occur before the fish are removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvest water if the fish dies in capture nets or on long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lines. In such an event, the degree of decomposition will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the sea temperature, time in the water, and particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species (Ref. 118). It is not uncommon to encounter water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures of 80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F in tropical waters, which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce rapid decomposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thus, rapid cooling of fish when they are captured is very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to prevent initiation of the process by which histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is produced. Fish subjected to 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for periods as short as one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day, a practice which can happen in warm climates on fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, will yield high levels of histamine, even if the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are later stored at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 117). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For these reasons, the guideline advises that processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products from scombroid toxin forming species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must ensure that their raw materials are essentially free of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition and histamine as a result of time/temperature abuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that occurred before the processor received them. The guideline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for three interrelated controls for the processor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply with regard to raw materials. For the first processor that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes ownership after harvest, these are: (1) Time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records from the harvesting vessel (Appendix B, section 3.a.1.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) organoleptic examination of the fish from the harvesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel for decomposition (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.); and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis, if warranted by the time/temperature history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the fish as revealed by the time/temperature record from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel or by the results of the organoleptic examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix B, section 3.a.3.), or both. Time/temperature records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel indicate whether entire lots from the vessel may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be suspect, and thus in need of a histamine examination, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of unusual events on the vessel. Such records would not normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveal, however, whether there are individual fish in the lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may have decomposition. An organoleptic examination for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition serves to screen individual fish. It also serves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a way to verify the time/temperature records from the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to an entire lot. If organoleptic examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveals an unusually high number of fish with decomposition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire lot should be considered suspect and subjected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Appendix B, section 3.a.1. provides for how the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor can take measures to determine whether the fish were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly harvested and handled on board the harvesting vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification of the mode of capture, including information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time between physical capture and bringing the fish on board, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling techniques, and the use of temperature logs onboard the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel that record that time/temperature history of the fish (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, catch date and time, means and rate of cooling, storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, and refrigerated brine or seawater temperature) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide documentation to the processor and to regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities that the fish were properly handled. Such records on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the handling of the fish should be part of an HACCP system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be used in the specific HACCP plans of processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The harvester's goal should be to bring the fish to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below as soon as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible after the fish dies to minimize the risk of histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. Cooling fish below 59 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (15 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), and preferably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), greatly reduces the growth of populations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bacteria that are most likely to cause histamine formation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7, p. 95). Once bacterial growth has begun, temperature at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or below 41 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) halts bacterial growth, although enzymatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine formation may slowly continue (Ref. 7, p. 95). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in proposed Appendix B, section 3.a.1., the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is recommending a slightly lower flesh temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below. This temperature is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations of safe temperatures in other sections of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation. Nonetheless, FDA specifically invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on the appropriateness of this temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.1. recommends that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature history from the vessel be on a lot-by-lot basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and defines a lot as a discrete storage compartment on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in keeping with industry practice. A lot typically reflects a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day's catch. Because a boat's catch can be subject to varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions and treatment from day-to-day, the time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records should be specific to each lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the time/temperature records suggest that, for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular lot, the conditions on the vessel were likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the fish, or if no adequate time/temperature records exist for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot, the guideline provides that a representative sample of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish from the lot be analyzed for histamine Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.ii.B.). The samples should be collected on a statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid sample schedule because variations in time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse are likely at various points in a ship's hold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second control, organoleptic examination by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor for decomposition, should be performed regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what the time/temperature records show (Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.). First, decomposition is a form of adulteration under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
403(a)(3) of the act. Second, as indicated earlier, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic examination provides a screening mechanism for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual fish. It is possible for the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be good but for some fish to develop decomposition anyway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, also as stated earlier, an examination for decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a way to verify the time/temperature records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that an organoleptic examination of each fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be highly impractical. Consequently, the guideline calls for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an examination of a representative number of fish to achieve a 95 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent certainty that the total number of fish in the lot that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhibit decomposition does not exceed 2.5 percent. (The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance of 2.5 percent is addressed in the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of Appendix B, section 3. a.2.iii. and a.2.iv.) Using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach, the number of fish examined will be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close to the total number of fish, so that the goal of screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual fish is preserved to the maximum extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, FDA expects that this representative sample will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large enough so as to provide a sufficient verification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature records for the entire lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides that no fish flesh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that exhibits any organoleptically detectable decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used for food. Aside from the clear violation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
402(a)(3) of the act presented by such decomposition, the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risk presented by decomposition in scombrotoxin forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species is unacceptable. While the existence of decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not mean that scombrotoxin is present, it does mean that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process has begun that can lead to the presence of scombrotoxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the shelf life of the fish or fishery product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances, e.g., large fish such as tuna, isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts of the fish will exhibit decomposition but other parts will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be free of decomposition. FDA recognizes that it is possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove those parts of a fish that have decomposition and salvage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remainder. Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconditioning so long as a histamine examination is performed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flesh that is free of decomposition. FDA believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine test is prudent under such circumstances to verify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin forming processes are not at work in that flesh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline also provides for how the processor should use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic examination and time/temperature records in tandem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether fish or fishery products from scombroid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species are fit for further processing or should first be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a histamine examination. If no decomposition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to, the formation of histamine in the fish, all the fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot may be further processed or directly entered into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.ii.). If, as stated earlier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time/temperature records are inadequate or indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that could cause histamine, the processor should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always conduct a histamine analysis on a representative sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the decomposition findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If decomposition is found in less than 2.5 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute to, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formation of histamine in the fish, Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.iii. provides that the decomposed fish should be removed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedure outlined in Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.i., but that it is not necessary to subject the lot to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine examination. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition below 2.5 percent is not significant in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the acceptability of the entire lot. Under the best conditions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is possible that some fish in a large lot will experience some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal decomposition. Under these circumstances, so long as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish with decomposition are culled from the lot, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason to suspect that the lot has been subject to unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that could cause histamine or scombrotoxin to form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is aware that the canned tuna industry uses the 2.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent value to determine whether special handling of a lot is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted (Ref. 119). The canned tuna industry has concluded, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just as FDA tentatively concludes, that levels above 2.5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent likely exposure of the fish in a lot to conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are out of the ordinary and potentially dangerous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, if the processor finds decomposition in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, those fish must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the lot, and a histamine examination needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed on a representative sample of the remaining fish in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.iv.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to recognize that where the time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records are inadequate for all the fish on a vessel, or show poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for all the fish from a vessel, histamine analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be performed on representative samples from each lot on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vessel. Although an appropriate number of fish for sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could possibly be provided from a single lot, the results would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be representative of the vessel as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.3. describes how fish should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed of depending on the results of a histamine examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with current policy, the agency expects that any fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is found to have histamine above a defect action level or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other regulatory level or limit for histamine established by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be used for food. Moreover, the agency expects, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in Appendix B, section 3.a.3.i., that a finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine over such level or limit in any fish in a lot from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel will result in the destruction of that entire lot, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the percentage of decomposition that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptically detected or the conditions on the vessel as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by the time/temperature records. Such a histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding strongly indicates that neither the records from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel nor the decomposition test (if the results were below 2.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent) are reliable. Histamine may be present in the absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of organoleptically detectable decomposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the agency expects, as reflected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.3.ii., that a finding of histamine below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the action level, but higher than is normally found in fresh fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 120 and 121), in any fish in a lot will result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate cooking of all the fish in the lot to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin will not form over the shelf life of the fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooking stops the histamine forming process once it has started. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without this cooking, any elevated temperatures later in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution system or in the home can result in a rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevation of histamine levels to hazardous levels (Ref. 117, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
341). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.b. addresses raw materials controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be exercised by subsequent processors, i.e., those other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the first processor to take possession of scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming fish and fish products from a harvester. Assuming that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first processor has met its responsibilities with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials as explained above, and has not caused a problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through improper handling during processing, subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors should determine whether decomposition occurred during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer from the previous processor. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideline provides, at Appendix B, section 3.b.1., that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent processors that do processing other than simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storing, should subject a representative sample of fish or fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products from each lot to an organoleptic examination. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding of decomposition in that sample should lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic examination of the entire lot. If decomposition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in more than 2.5 percent of the fish in the lot, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor should perform a histamine examination on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of fish from the lot. These gradations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the expectations reflected in the guidelines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded these measures need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken by those who only store fish and fishery products. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature abuse can occur during storage, and thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombroid toxin forming species must be &blank;held &blank;at &blank;appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&blank;temperatures (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below), the hazard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin in the finished product can be controlled by those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who own the product or manipulate it during processing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As suggested above, time/temperature abuse can occur during processing as well as before the raw materials are received.
It is important that processors identify critical control points and suitable controls that will protect fish and
fish products that can form scombrotoxin from time/temperature abuse. As the guideline for scombrotoxin states
in Appendix B, section 5., many of the controls for time and temperature in the guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat
products should be applicable to the processing of scombrotoxin forming species. Such handling conditions are necessary
to control histamine production. In addition, Appendix B, section 4. provides that products that are undergoing
processing not be exposed to ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for more than 4 hours during that processing. The agency recognizes that for many products, manipulation
under unrefrigerated conditions is necessary. The processor must be aware, however, that during such periods the
product will be exposed to conditions that can lead to histamine formation. Appendix B, section 4. describes how to
minimize this possibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with Appendix B, section 4., the processor should monitor the length of time that the product is exposed to
ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or higher. Documentation of the time/temperature monitoring controls will facilitate management and regulatory
review.

L. Guideline for Product Integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Economic Adulteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Economic adulteration occurs when a consumer is misled about the worth, amount, or identity of a food product and,
therefore, unknowingly pays for value not received. Economically deceptive practices in the representation of
a food's value may occur in a number of ways. Sections 402(b) and 403 of the act define the conditions and practices that
result, respectively, in the economic adulteration and misbranding of a food. In addition, the Fair Packaging and
Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
requires that food packages and their labeling provide consumers with accurate information about the identity and
net quantity of the contents, so that consumers can make fair value comparisons among products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While any food may be subjected to economic adulteration or to misbranding, fish and fishery products present distinctive
characteristics and processing procedures that make them more susceptible to abusive economic practices than most
foods. The great variety of finfish, shellfish, and crustacean species, as well as the multiplicity of products prepared
from them, including fabricated surimi-based products that imitate actual seafoods, provide ample opportunity
for both inadvertent and deliberate economic adulteration and misbranding practices that result in economic loss
to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most important among the characteristics that make seafoods vulnerable to abuse is the similar appearance of many
finfish, in the whole, raw state, in the form of fillets, or as ingredients. Unlike the situation with the limited types
of red meats and fowl, it is very difficult for most consumers to detect the substitution of an economically inferior
species for a more valuable one that is declared on the label or in labeling (e.g., the substitution of rockfish for
red snapper). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irrespective of the relative economic value of the substitute species, section 403(a)(1) of the act states that a
food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is false and misleading in any particular. More specifically,
a food is misbranded under section 403(b) of the act if it is offered for sale under the name of another food. If the substituted
fish is less valuable than the species represented on the label or labeling, the product is also adulterated under
section 402(b)(2) of the act, which states that a food shall be deemed to be adulterated if any substance has been substituted
wholly or in part therefor. Consequently, it is a clear violation of the act when a finfish, shellfish, or crustacean
is not correctly identified on its label or in its labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the misidentification of species may also have adverse public health consequences. Should an illness
or outbreak occur from a seafood product, it is essential for proper diagnoses and treatment that public health investigators
not be prevented from quickly identifying the exact cause or agent responsible in the food, and from tracing it back
to the correct source of the food to prevent further sale and consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in a seafood related incident that occurred in 1982, in New York, two men became ill shortly after eating
a fish dinner in a restaurant. Species substitution caused investigators to erroneously suspect that the illnesses
were caused by ciguatoxin because the food was identified as being red snapper, a species which could cause that illness.
The food actually was mahi, a fish which is often associated with scombroid poisoning (Ref. 122). Scombroid poisoning
is associated with high levels of histamine.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA found that the fish mislabeled as red snapper had been shipped from Ecuador and processed in Panama. Had the fish
been labeled as mahi, it would not have been permitted entry into the United States because FDA had an automatic detention
for mahi from Ecuador at the time because of problems with high levels of histamine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another instance involving species substitution resulting in a negative public health consequence occurred in
Hawaii in 1987. Fifty illnesses, 32 of which required medical attention, were attributed to the consumption of limpets
misbranded as ``Baby Abalone.'' The symptoms displayed were those of a histamine-type reaction. Because abalone
is not one of the species expected to form histamine, substituting limpets for abalone put consumers at risk from a
food that they had not intended to eat. Thus, accurate identification of species is essential to public health protection
and prompt accurate diagnosis and treatment of illness when that protection fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processing practices traditionally used in the seafood industry also are easily abused to increase a product's weight,
in the form of ice or water. For instance, frozen fillets, shrimp, crab legs, and other products are normally protected
from dehydration (freezer burn) while frozen by the application of a light glaze of ice. A packer then includes added
product in the package to compensate for the weight of the glaze. Excessive amounts of glaze, however, not compensated
for in this manner, can deliberately be used to increase the apparent weight, and therefore the apparent value, of
the product delivered. Percentage weight increases from overglazing are most dramatic for foods with high surface
area to volume ratios, such as shrimp. Overglazing is a practice that violates section 402(b)(4) of the act because
a substance has been added to increase a food's weight or to make it appear of greater value than it is. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar type of fraud frequently results from oversoaking fish and shellfish meats in dip solutions. Dip solutions
are customarily used to retard the natural loss of moisture (drip loss) from products such as scallops, which are particularly
susceptible to drip loss. However, exposure to the dip may deliberately be prolonged to add weight in the form of water.
Dip solutions may contain chemicals, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, that can greatly enhance the amount of water
absorbed by the scallops. The net effect of such practices is to mislead the consumer into purchasing added water at
scallop prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seafoods generally represent a high dollar value per unit weight compared with other foods, particularly crab, lobster,
shrimp, and certain shellfish. Thus, even relatively modest percentage weight increases from abusive glazing or
water uptake from dip solutions represent a substantial loss of value to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reason, the potential fraudulent profit from similar practices of adding less valuable ingredients,
such as breading on shrimp and fish sticks or water to shucked oysters, to increase the size or weight of products are
enticing to unscrupulous processors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that economic adulteration occurs with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient frequency in various seafood products to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial losses to the consumer. Evidence of such economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulteration usually comes to light indirectly, as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations that are carried out for other purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourteen and one-half percent of the samples of seafoods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported in 1986 as having adverse findings by eight FDA district 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices were so listed because of product misrepresentation (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, FDA found that in fiscal years 1991 and 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14.8 and 11.7 percent, respectively, of all consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved complaints of economic problems (Ref. 60). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Imported seafood products also are subject to significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of economic misrepresentation. In 1992, approximately 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of all detentions of imported seafood involved some form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of misbranding, such as false or misleading labeling, short fill, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short weight, standard of identity, and omitted labeling (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
124). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific data on species substitution are available from The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL) of NMFS, Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Commerce. Data gathered for the 3-year period of 1990&hyph;1992 by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the laboratory in conducting species verification tests requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by industry show that 59 percent of the samples labeled as cod, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57 percent of the product labeled as haddock, 56 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product labeled as flounder or sole, and 51 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product labeled as red snapper were not the species claimed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label. While these data cannot be regarded as representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of industry-wide misbranding practices because the testing was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not random, the results indicate a remarkably high incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species substitution. Moreover, these findings are consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with other surveys (Ref. 35, p. 45). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a survey conducted in Florida to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent of retail species substitution in the case of red snapper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that 64 percent of the fish fillets labeled for retail sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as red snapper were misbranded (Ref. 125). The prevalence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranding just this one desirable species is underscored by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observation: ``If all of the red snapper sold in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States were genuine, the seas would long since have been swept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absolutely clean of this species'' (Ref. 126, p. 41). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While most States' regulations follow FDA nomenclature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy and regulations, misbranding practices are exacerbated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the failure of some States to require these common names for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species sold within the State. Red snapper again provides a case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study in the extent of variation in acceptable nomenclature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed for a species. Although not permitted when sold in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce, California regulations allow 12 species of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rockfish to be labeled as ``Pacific red snapper'' within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, Oregon and Washington regulations also allow rockfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be called ``snapper'' (Ref. 126, p. 305). Moreover, an even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater variety of imported species may be misrepresented as ``red

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many in the seafood industry believe that economic abuse is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one its most significant problems. A survey conducted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Fisheries Institute found that the Institute's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membership supported mandatory inspection as a means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overcoming practices that pose a threat to the reputation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and packers adhering to scrupulous practices in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation of their products (Ref. 127). General agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was found to exist among processors, distributors, and importers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as retailers and restaurateurs, that abusive economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices are widespread, including overglazing and overbreading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fishery products, inaccurate net weight measurement, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution of inferior species for more valuable fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a similar industry study by the Southeastern Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, members ranked problems with economic fraud (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species identification, overglazing, and the use of phosphates) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above all other seafood industry problems, except vessel handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices (Ref. 128). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Recommended Adoption of HACCP-Based Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency recognizes that HACCP was developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily to address safety, FDA believes that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in &sect;123.6, for seafood processors to adopt HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to ensure the safety of seafoods provides an opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to develop and apply effective control point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that they can use to ensure that seafoods comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of sections 402(b) and 403 of the act, The Fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Packaging and Labeling Act, the seafood standards of identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated in 21 CFR, and applicable compliance policy guides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by the agency (Compliance Policy Guides 7108.01, 7108.03, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7108.04, 7108.12, 7108.13, 7108.14, 7108.21, and 7108.23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the agency is proposing in Appendix D to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a guideline for HACCP-based procedures to avoid economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulteration and misbranding of seafoods. Following this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideline will enable processors to develop procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records that will establish that they are not engaged in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that would render their products economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated. Clearly, however, guidelines cannot prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following guideline for product integrity lists critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points covering raw material receipt, processing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels and labeling that processors and importers can incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their HACCP plans. The agency believes that proper control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins with verification of the raw materials received by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. Therefore, in Appendix D, section 2.a., the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggesting that, as part of their HACCP plan, processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers should include critical control points beginning with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the receipt of raw materials. Ensuring that raw materials meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits (e.g., correct species identification, net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, additive identification) at the point they enter a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's or importer's control is crucial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of ways to ensure that species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly identified. Physical examination, as indicated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D, section 2.a.1. is the typical method of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identity of a species. The agency believes that most seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers are knowledgeable about the species that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they handle and would have personnel available at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt who could monitor the incoming shipments for species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution. Expert consultation is another option for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly identifying species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processors or importers can also check the identity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood by employing laboratory services, as provided for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D, section 2.a.2. Protein chromatography is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory method that can accurately establish the species of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products (Ref. 50). Another option, Appendix D, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 2.a.3., is to receive raw materials certified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers under either limited or general and continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranties (section 303(c)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)(2)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Appendix D, section 2.b., the agency points out that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors must ensure that the labels, labeling, and invoices of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their finished products accurately list weight, count, size, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product identity, as well as the content of valuable constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., that ingredient that the consumer identifies as providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reason to purchase the product, for example, the shrimp in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaded shrimp). The content of the valuable constituents must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be maintained as required by FDA's standards of identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (21 CFR part 161, including: oysters, Pacific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon, canned wet packed shrimp in transparent or nontransparent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers, frozen raw breaded shrimp, frozen raw lightly breaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp, and canned tuna) or in accordance with FDA's compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy guides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specifically, as in Appendix D, section 2.b.1., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species must be correctly identified by its common or usual name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and be so represented on the label and labeling. To assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and consumers, FDA has developed both printed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
database versions of the ``FDA Fish List'' to provide such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance. Also specific requirements for such labeling are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in Standards of Identity and the Common or Usual Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (21 CFR, parts 161 and 102). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D, sections 2.b.2. through b.5. are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 402(b) of the act. Under Appendix D, section 2.b.2., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor needs to ensure that valuable constituents of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product are not omitted or abstracted. For example, breaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp must contain the required weight ratio of shrimp to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breading. Similarly, shrimp must be of the size and/or weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified on the label or labeling.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Appendix D, section 2.b.3., the processor needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that no substance is substituted wholly or in part for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable constituent. For example, substitution of crab flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surimi cannot be used in whole or in part instead of crab meat in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a product labeled as crab cake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Appendix D, section 2.b.4., the processor needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that damage or inferiority is not concealed in any manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This means, for example, that bleaching or coloring of product to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conceal its true nature or condition of wholesomeness is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable.

M. Additional Guidance_FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide Including Specific Guidance on
Smoked Fishery Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an adjunct to its rulemaking to require HACCP procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the seafood industry, FDA is drafting an extensive guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to use in understanding and implementing HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles for their operations. This guidance will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that processors and importers can use in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of their HACCP plans. This information consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largely of an identification of hazards that can affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of seafood and a review of control measures that can keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards from actually occurring, or that can at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the likelihood of their occurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has included selected portions of the draft HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance as Appendix 1 to this proposal, so as to better inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public about how this guidance will be structured and about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the kinds of assistance that will be available to processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers who implement HACCP. The agency emphasizes, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this guidance is a work-in-progress and still being developed by FDA. Nonetheless, the agency seeks comment
on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for this guidance and the usefulness of the format the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency proposes to adopt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA is including in Appendix 1 specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on time-temperature and salinity parameters and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matters for use in the HACCP plans of processors of smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fishery products. While FDA is seeking comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guidance generally, it particularly seeks comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to the safe processing of smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products is found in various sections of the HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance because this general guidance is primarily organized by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard rather than by commodity type. However, the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathered the materials relating to smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products into a single section of the guidance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate use of this guidance by this industry, and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate obtaining public comment on it. As stated above, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance, on their validity as guidelines, and on whether they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made mandatory by incorporating them into any final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation that results from this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While no known outbreaks of botulism attributed to smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish have been reported since 1963, FDA believes that the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by manufacturers to obtain information about the composition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot- and cold-process products represents a potential health hazard. Without analytical results from the testing
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt and sodium nitrite levels, a manufacturer cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the fish have been adequately processed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spore outgrowth and toxin production. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's concerns are underscored by the diversity of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures and salt levels used in the manufacture of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, particularly the lower range temperatures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt levels (Ref. 24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as stated above, the use of modified atmosphere and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum packaging with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also a source of concern. These types of packaging provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anaerobic environment in which
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores can grow out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and produce botulin, the causative agent in botulism. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed, the toxin attacks the central nervous system and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause death if untreated within 3 to 6 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all these reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some type of guidance that defines the procedures for the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fish is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, fish have been smoked in order to preserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. Today, the primary reason for smoking is to impart certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taste and texture qualities to the fish. There are essentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two types of smoked fish: (1) Those that are subjected to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``cold process'' that leaves the fish soft and moist, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delicate smoke flavor, such as lox, and (2) those that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjected to a ``hot process'' that produces a less moist, firmer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product with heavier smoke flavor, such as smoked whitefish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The processing of these fish basically involves: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleaning and gutting followed by (2) immersion in a brine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution or dry salt in order to salt them, (3) drying in a cool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature to avoid bacterial growth, (4) smoking in a smoking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber at a temperature and for a time necessary to achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desired ``cold process'' or ``hot process'' effect, and (5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging and cooling. The taste and texture qualities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to ``cold process'' smoked fish require much lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures during the smoking phase of the process than those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to ``hot process.'' Salted fish may not be smoked at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with virtually all fish, the species used to make smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are exposed during their lives to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a spore- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming bacterium that is ubiquitous in the marine and freshwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. Type E is the predominant type of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in fish, other aquatic animals, water, and sediment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although other types such as A, proteolytic and nonproteolytic B, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C, D, and F also have been found in fish (Refs. 148 through 152). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concentration of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores that may be expected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and on a naturally contaminated fish is unknown, although it is reported to vary from one spore per 16 g of fish to one
spore per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
200 g (Refs. 153 and 180). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under certain conditions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can produce a toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that causes botulism, a disease that attacks the central nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system of humans and can cause death within 3 to 6 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion if not properly treated (Ref. 193). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum's
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to form spores means that in a dormant state, it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive environments that are otherwise hostile to it. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is ``anaerobic,'' meaning that air constitutes a hostile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. When conditions become favorable, that is, when no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air is present, the spores experience ``outgrowth'' during which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin can be produced. In fish, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intestines and can also adhere to the surface of fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment of most any fish processor and cannot be totally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated using reasonable means. Moreover, even though a fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be cleaned, gutted, and air packaged, some risk will still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores can find their way into muscle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissue during processing. Muscle tissue below the surface of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish can provide an anaerobic environment where outgrowth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin production can occur if time and temperature permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the processing procedures in Appendix 1 are based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on studies of the time-temperature and salinity conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to prevent the outgrowth of botulinum spores, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices are also effective in the elimination of risk from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other pathogenic bacteria such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a pathogenic bacterium that is widespread in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and that is commonly isolated from surface waters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other environmental samples. Thus the likelihood of finding this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogen on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been linked to the consumption of contaminated foods (Refs. 130, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
131, and 132), thereby demonstrating the etiologic importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foodborne transmission of this disease in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although listeriosis is a relatively rare illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(approximately 2,000 reported cases per year in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States), the exceptionally high mortality rate, as high as 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases in the United States. The highest incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listeriosis generally occurs in neonates, the elderly, pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women, and individuals suffering from compromised immune systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there are instances in which apparently healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals have contracted listeriosis (Refs. 130 and 133). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of

Listeria

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species (including

L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in frozen raw and cooked seafood products is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reportedly as high as 61 percent (Ref. 136). Indeed, numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood products have been shown to support growth of

of prolific growth on smoked salmon stored at 4

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test inocula as low as 6 organisms per gram (g) are applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surface of fish samples (Ref. 139). Seafoods other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoked or smoke-flavored fish have been epidemiologically linked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to two outbreaks and one sporadic case of listeriosis (Ref. 140). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, several cooked seafood products have been recalled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the market in North America because of contamination with

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recent survey of smoked fish and smoked fish products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iceland has shown that 29 percent of samples tested were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 141). Another survey revealed that 8.9 percent and 13.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of hot- and cold-smoked fish, respectively, were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 142). Cold-smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may pose a significant health risk, particularly when stored for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended periods. When raw salmon was inoculated with known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and smoked at 78.8 to 86 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (26 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 30 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 6 hours, and the finished product stored at 39.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 and 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for up to 30 days, investigators observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial increases in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 populations at both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incubation temperatures (Ref. 143). No known cases of listeriosis have been linked to smoked seafood consumption
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, studies have shown that properly controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot-smoking processes effectively eliminate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination (Ref. 144). In raw trout inoculated with high doses of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, stored for 12 hours in a marinade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing 10 percent NaCl, and then subjected to a hot-smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process (dried for 30 minutes at 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), cooked at 230 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(110 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) until an internal temperature of 149 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (65 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained for 20 minutes, and finally smoked for 45 minutes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 did not survive the smoking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, when fish were inoculated after smoking and stored at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46.4 to 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (8 to 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 populations was observed after up to 20 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. These findings further emphasize the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing the contamination of processed fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have also shown the importance of controlling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt concentration in smoked fish. Although 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive in environments containing up to 20 percent NaCl (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
145), it has been demonstrated that the organism becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasingly more sensitive to NaCl when it is exposed to heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing (Ref. 146). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the prevalence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, it may be impossible to completely eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism from all foods. However, use of the sanitary practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and processing practices proposed in this document should prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-contamination and growth of the organism in smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored seafoods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smoking fish is a delicate process, involving a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interrelated variables including times, temperatures, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to smoke, salt, and sodium nitrite, when used. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that, by its very nature, this process involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain inherent risks, risks that, if not attended to, can have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very significant consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the times/temperatures involved in the ``hot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process'' can injure but not kill
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killing spoilage microorganisms. Thus, during the period when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spoilage microorganisms are becoming reestablished, surviving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores would be presented with an optimum growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment because of the lack of competition. Yet, because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the absence of spoilage microorganisms, spoilage odors that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warn consumers away from potentially dangerous products would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be present. Botulism toxin alone is not detectable by sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because of the number and types of steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved, the processing of smoked fish involves an unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of handling of the product relative to other seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing procedures. Increased handling presents increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities for contamination during the process than would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise be the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The finished product also is inherently more risky than most other seafood products because it is a ready-to-eat product
that is generally not cooked before eating. However, the present evidence indicates that smoked fish has caused no
more cases of botulism in the United States than any other type of seafood product. In contrast, fresh fillets that
are not smoked are intended to be cooked before consumption. Cooking is lethal to bacteria and will deactivate botulism
toxin. Thus, smoked fish products usually do not get the benefit of an additional processing step that protects against
most bacteriological risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these inherent characteristics, FDA believes that smoked fish present special risks because both
domestic and foreign processors are now using vacuum packaging to a substantial extent_much more so than are other
segments of the seafood industry. A 1988&hyph;1989 FDA and New York State survey of domestic processing plants, for
example, showed that 45 percent of the firms visited vacuum-packaged smoked fish. However, there is no evidence to
show a linkage between vacuum packaging of smoked fish and illness in the 5 years since this survey was completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An economic incentive for use of vacuum packaging is the extended shelf-life of the product, made possible by the anaerobic
environment in the package that prevents the growth of some spoilage microorganisms and slows the growth of others.
Because this anaerobic environment cannot prevent spoilage altogether, vacuum-packaged products must still be
refrigerated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the anaerobic environment greatly favors the outgrowth of any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores that may be present over the development of telltale spoilage microorganisms. Thus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 outgrowth can occur before spoilage if a vacuum-packaged product is temperature abused, i.e., not refrigerated.
Moreover, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E and nonproteolytic type B is possible even at refrigeration temperatures below 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). FDA believes that strict controls are needed to overcome this risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1970, FDA issued a final rule for smoked fish in response to outbreaks of botulism attributed to vacuum-packaged
smoked fish products (35 FR 17401, November 13, 1970). Among other things, the rule attempted to control the risk of
botulism by setting conservative processing parameters for time, temperature, and salinity that would minimize
the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spore outgrowth. These parameters were based on the relatively limited research that had been conducted up to that
time with one species of fish. Many processors claimed that these parameters would have resulted in a product that
was too salty and too dry in texture to be marketable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule was overturned in court due to procedural problems (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Nova Scotia Food Products Corp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 568 F.2d 240 (2d Cir. 1977)). However, in rethinking this rule after the remand, FDA decided that research was needed
into the relationships among time, temperature, and salinity to develop processing parameters that would provide
safety without producing an undesirable product that consumers would not buy.

This research has been successfully conducted by FDA, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the industry. FDA
has prepared the time, temperature, and salinity parameters in the Hazard Assessment Guide based on the results of
this research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Need for Guidance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA routinely inspects smoked fish processing establishments for sanitary conditions using the guidance in 21 CFR
part 110, ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Human Food'' (Ref. 196) and
in the FDA Inspection Operations Manual, Chapter 5, Establishment Inspection and section 616.6 Smoked Fish inspection
methods (Ref. 197). In addition to the Establishment Inspection Reports (EIR's) discussed in section G, EIR's for
smoked fish processing establishments over the past few years (1985 to the present) show evidence that the use of manufacturing
procedures are not in line with CGMP's. The EIR's also show that processing parameters and controlled processing
and storage techniques, commonly recognized as appropriate in the industry (Ref. 182) are not being used (Ref. 169).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typical observations by FDA officials in these inspections include: (1) Live flies in production areas providing
a vehicle for contamination and recontamination of products; (2) standing water in production rooms providing a
medium for microbial growth and contamination from splashed water; (3) utensils not sanitized prior to use; (4) open
bags of raw materials in storage areas exposing products to flying insects and potential microbial contamination;
(5) smoke racks encrusted with pieces of fish from previous processes, thus providing an opportunity for microbial
growth; (6) refrigerators being used for both raw and finished products, thus providing an environment for microbial
growth through cross-contamination between unprocessed and processed products; (7) overcrowded fish in brine
tanks, whereby some fish are not fully submerged in brine, resulting in lower and uneven levels of salt uptake that
would not be effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth; (8) salinity and microbiologic testing not performed on products;
(9) low minimum water-phase salt levels (0.88 to 1.79 percent) that would not inhibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spore outgrowth and toxin production; and (10) poor employee practices that foster microbial contamination, including
spitting into sinks adjacent to sinks used to thaw product, not washing or sanitizing hands, and street clothes in
contact with product (Ref. 169). (See also Ref. 200.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its Fiscal Year (FY) 91 Domestic Fish and Fishery Products Inspection Assignment, FDA conducted food safety
inspections of smoked fish establishments. These inspections revealed a continuing pattern of problems in these
facilities. In over half of these inspections FDA found violations that required action, ranging from minor violations,
which are normally handled by informing the firm's official during the inspection, to more serious violations that
prompted some form of official agency action (Ref. 200).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several States, working through AFDO, have expressed concern that a potential health hazard exists
with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products and have stated that a Federal regulation is necessary for uniform regulation
of the production and distribution of these foods (Refs. 170 and 189). AFDO is an organization of Federal, State, and
local regulatory officials with membership representing all 50 states, as well as FDA and other Federal agencies.
AFDO's Central States Regional organization held a meeting in 1988, attended by public health officials from 6 states
in which the smoked fish industry is concentrated, Canada, and NMFS, to discuss a Federal regulation governing the
processing, storage, and distribution of smoked and smoke-flavored fish products. In December, 1989, AFDO first
passed a resolution requesting that FDA expedite the rulemaking process to establish uniform Federal regulations
to ensure that safe smoked fish processing methods are utilized for fish products sold in the United States. In December,
1990, AFDO passed resolution 8, which strongly encouraged FDA to ``accelerate the promulgation of smoked fish CGMP's
so that concerned States can move forward with their efforts to ensure the safety of smoked fish'' (Ref. 170). FDA recognizes
the need to address the hazards associated with smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products and therefore is setting
forth the procedures in Appendix 1 in the interest of protecting the public health.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for some type of agency guidance on smoked fish is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also evidenced by several other factors. First, the 1970 final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, which covered only hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish and the processing parameters that they required,
is still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being used as a guideline by some States. These earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters could result in commercially undesirable products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These parameters ought to be updated with the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological understanding and processing flexibility for both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot and cold smoked products. The guidance in this document can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the basis on which such updating can occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the manufacture or sale of cold-processed fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products is not permitted in at least two States because there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no regulations or regulatory guidelines for these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 170). There is some pressure, however, to permit the sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these products. The Canadian Government, for example, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged these States, Minnesota and Michigan, to permit the sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products so that Canadian products may be exported to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States (Ref. 170). Some type of guidance that helps to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define the processing parameters and techniques that reduce human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risks from cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would provide State, as well as federal, public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials with the tools necessary to evaluate the safety of cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed products manufactured in the United States, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in 1988 FDA conducted a survey of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters used by fish smoking plants in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventy five percent of the firms surveyed did not do final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product testing to ascertain whether their products met commonly recognized (Ref. 182) parameters for their products
(Ref. 24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected in this survey augmented information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the New York State Department of Agriculture and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing (Ref. 24), which had conducted a similar survey of fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking establishments in that State at approximately the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. A total of 64 establishments were surveyed by FDA and New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York State, representing over 90 percent of the smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers in the United States. Among the species of fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the survey were chubs, bluefish, trout, carp, salmon, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whitefish, and herring. Processing information was collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from manufacturers, and samples were collected for laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranged from 0.88 to 27.5 percent and in cold-process products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 1.33 to 18.1 percent. Twenty-eight firms (43.7 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum packed cold-process products, but 60.7 percent of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms did not test final products for water-phase salt content or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for residual sodium nitrite. Twenty-five firms (39.1 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum packed hot-process products, but 68 percent of those firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not test final products for water-phase salt content or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual sodium nitrite. Seventy-five percent of the firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed did not test final products for water-phase salt content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or for residual sodium nitrite, where used. Since this survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was conducted, the frequency of FDA inspections of smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments has been increased over 50 percent each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is providing guidance on the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for processing smoked fishery products in Appendix 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance addresses critical control points that apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products as a class and that will typically be identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the HACCP plans of most processors of smoke and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The guidance also addresses ways of controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards at these critical control points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key processing parameters that must be controlled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the safety of these products involve time, temperature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and salinity. While a range of time-temperature-salinity (TTS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values will provide a safe product, there are now known safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimums for these values that have been developed through years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of research. Processors whose TTS values fall below these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimums do not produce a safe product and shift much of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden of preventing botulism toxin outgrowth to those who take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of these products after they leave the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant, including the ultimate consumer. This burden includes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among other things, maintaining strict temperature control at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or lower even though it is known that many commercial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home refrigerators are unable to maintain this temperature (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
201). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These TTS minimums are known to produce a marketable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, because there are processors that operate in conformance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with them. Moreover, because they are minimums, these values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for the production of a variety of products, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different types of lox with varying amounts of saltiness, to suit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different tastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These minimum TTS values provide the only scientifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid way developed to date of ensuring that no botulism toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be produced over the shelf life of the product under proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration conditions or under conditions of moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature abuse. The minimum values, coupled with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation practices proposed in this document, should also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure against the presence of detectable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These minimum TTS values are being issued at this time as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed guidance to ensure maximum flexibility. If these values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reflected in the HACCP plans that are required by proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, and are being effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented by the processor, the agency is likely to find that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan and its implementation are adequate with regard to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits and critical control points. The same holds true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the other types of controls recommended in the guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is requesting comment on this approach, and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following alternatives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Issue all or part of the materials relating to smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 as regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than guidance. Given the public health concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with these products and the scientific basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TTS minimums, it may well be appropriate to issue them as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Such regulations would take into account advances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in knowledge and technology by allowing processors to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative processing parameters so long as these alternatives were scientifically demonstrated to produce an
equivalent level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety. (Section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 contains such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feature.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Issue a performance standard as a regulation, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaving the materials in Appendix 1 as guidelines on how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors could meet the performance standard. The likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standard would be, as suggested above (and included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and smoke- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavored fishery products in Appendix 1): (a) for botulism, zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin production in the product during a time period through_and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slightly beyond_the shelf life of the product, demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through inoculated pack studies under normal and moderate abuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions; and (b) no detectable L. monocytogenes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Maintain the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products in the FDA Fish and Fishery Products

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazards and Controls Guide and control safety through the HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for all seafood in proposed subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA requests comment on which of these alternatives is most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to ensure that smoked fish will be safe and is most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the agency's obligations under the act. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of a regulation or guideline, how can the agency best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the results of the research that it has conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be available for use by the industry? FDA solicits comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these and the matters raised above.

N. Verification Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in section IV.A. of this document, one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACMCF's seven HACCP principles involves verification that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system is working. NACMCF recommends that HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include procedures for verification of the HACCP system (Ref. 34, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 200). FDA advises processors to consider adopting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation, but has not proposed to require it because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency expects verification to occur through: (1) A firm's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency with the controls and limits to be provided by FDA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HACCP guidance described in section VII.C. and M. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document; (2) third-party technical assistance provided through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade associations, universities and government agencies; and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of all HACCP monitoring records by trained individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before distribution of product (see proposed &sect;123.8(b)); the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed corrective action requirements (see proposed &sect;123.7), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially the provision for assessment of HACCP plans as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequence of deviations (&sect;123.7(a)(4)); the recommended use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authorities for cooked, ready-to-eat products (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A); the proposed general training requirements (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.9); and inspector review during routine agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. FDA invites comment on whether this approach is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to ensure that the NACMCF verification principle is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being properly addressed, both for individual firms and for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall HACCP program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For individual firms, NACMCF specifically discourages the sole reliance on end-product sampling for verification
purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 34, p. 201). FDA also has questions concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficacy of end-product sampling as the only way to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success of HACCP. These caveats notwithstanding, FDA invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on what tests should be used to measure success, both in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of individual firms and the program as a whole, and how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently such tests should be administered.

VIII. Other Approaches to HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This preamble has described in great detail the HACCP system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is being proposed and the reasoning behind each proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision. While the agency is inviting comment on the merits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each provision, FDA also invites comment on the overall system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including whether some other approach to HACCP or some variation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed approach might be preferable. Variations on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed approach include, but are not limited to: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring HACCP only for higher risk seafood products; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempting small firms from HACCP requirements; (3) staggering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date for implementation based on size of firm or risk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (4) deleting or altering some of the requirements in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal in order to facilitate implementation and lower costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A brief discussion of each of these variations follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Higher Risk Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An alternative to requiring HACCP for all commercial seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would be to require it for products or processes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been linked to significant numbers reported seafood-borne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses. As section II.B. of this document explains in detail, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many of the reported illnesses from seafood involve raw molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish and certain species of finfish that can accumulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin. Other seafood products cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness but are not as commonly reported. FDA invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether this proposed regulation should apply only to molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish and the species responsible for scombrotoxin and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ciguatoxin poisonings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variation on this approach would be to have the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation apply to those species and processes with a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for harm, even if actual illnesses from them cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented from the foodborne illness reporting system. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described earlier in the preamble, the fact that the system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not recording illnesses from a particular food does not mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses are not occurring. Also, potential for harm need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always be measured in terms of the number of illnesses that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually occurring. For example, some problems, like botulism, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may occur infrequently, but when they do, the consequences can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devastating. Based on the potential for harm, other candidates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for inclusion would be: (1) Hot-process smoked and hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish, cold-process smoked and cold-process smoke- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavored fish, because of the hazards of botulism and listeria; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) cooked, ready-to-eat products, because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological hazards associated with products that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to be cooked by the consumer; (3) low acid canned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods, because of the hazard of botulism and general complexity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the processing operation; (4) raw, ready-to-eat products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the risk of parasites; and (5) species that require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment as to appropriate location of harvest to avoid unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pesticide or industrial contaminant levels.

B. Exempting Small Firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA invites comment on whether small firms should be exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the proposed regulation. Even if exempted, these firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would still be subject to the requirements of current food safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law and to inspection by FDA and State authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier in this preamble, small operations are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
norm in the seafood industry. A significant majority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors have total revenues of under 1 million dollars. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small firms are to be exempted, FDA invites comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria that should be used for exempting them, including how a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small firm should be defined for purposes of an exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of HACCP may be more burdensome for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms than for large firms. Large firms tend to have quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control personnel already in place. In addition, many regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are less burdensome for a large firm in proportion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to output than they are for a small firm. On the other hand, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is taking steps, such as the preparation of its HACCP guidance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to minimize the cost of these regulations for small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, such an exemption may not be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also points out that, because many large firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already have quality control systems, an exemption for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business would appear to result in requiring HACCP for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment of the industry (i.e., large firms) that needs it the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least. Large processors, moreover, tend to process relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low risk products, such as breaded fish and shrimp and raw fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blocks. Many high-risk processors, such as processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products, tend to be small, and processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw molluscan shellfish tend to be very small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, an exemption for small business could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to those small businesses that produce low risk products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and FDA invites comment on this approach. As stated earlier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the criteria for determining low as well as high risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not clear, due largely to the limitations of the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foodborne illness reporting system. Moreover, a case can be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that risk also relates to the margin for error in a processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation and to the consequences of failure as well as to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual occurrence of illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these points in mind, FDA invites comment on how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define ``low risk.'' FDA also invites comment on what the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the exemption should be. Should a firm be exempt from all or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the HACCP requirements? As circumstances change, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP-based analysis of risk by a firm might reveal that the firm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has become a high risk processor rather than a low risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. In addition, FDA invites comment on whether such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption should be obtained by petitioning the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, even if an exemption were to be adopted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule based on the comments received, the agency would still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage voluntary adoption of HACCP systems by exempted firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advantages that HACCP is expected to provide in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer confidence, control of process, and access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international markets warrant adoption of this system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA also invites comment on the effect of a small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption on the regulation of imports. How would HACCP be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to imports under a tiered approach? Would it be possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treat domestic and imported products equally under such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Staggered Phase-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations include an effective date of 1 year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the publication of a final rule. FDA has explained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasoning behind this proposed effective date and has invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on it elsewhere in this preamble. In addition, comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are invited on the merits of a staggered phase-in instead of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single implementation date for all affected entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two most obvious ways of accomplishing a staggered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-in would be to differentiate on the basis of size or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of risk. Differentiating on the basis of size would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumably allow small businesses to have a longer time or times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for implementation than would be allowed for larger firms. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested earlier, large firms are probably much more able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement a HACCP system than are small firms. Theoretically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the longer lead time for small firms would allow the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector to develop an infrastructure that could help small firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement HACCP. Such an infrastructure could include process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities (see the preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products), testing facilities, and consulting services from trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations, academia, and others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional consideration, FDA will likely learn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lessons from its experiences in implementing the regulation that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it could apply to the benefit of those that would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement it at a later date. For example, FDA is considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it should make the first review of HACCP plans by agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators a nonregulatory evaluation to facilitate plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development by the processor (although the overall inspection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant would be regulatory). The agency invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach. Presumably, the more experience the agency has, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the better this evaluation will be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, as noted above, small firms are involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the processing of higher risk products. How does this fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bear on the possibility of longer implementation times for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differentiation solely on the basis of risk appears to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more complex than differentiation on the basis of size. If high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk products were to be phased in first, it would appear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those with the most complex plans to develop and implement would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive the shortest lead time, while those with the simplest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans would receive the longest lead time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the criteria for determining risk would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully considered. FDA asks for comment on whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staggered start should begin with raw molluscan shellfish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain species of finfish that can accumulate scombrotoxin and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ciguatoxin, or whether other criteria should apply, as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA invites comment on all these matters. FDA also invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the effect of a phase-in approach on the regulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imports. How could this approach be applied to imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Deleting or Modifying Aspects of This Proposal, or Taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some Other Step, to Reduce the Burden of Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As has already been explained in this preamble, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed only the basics of HACCP in order to keep the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden to a minimum. Several features of HACCP included within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NACMCF's seven principles, such as flow charts and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of ``HACCP teams,'' are noted in this preamble, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has not proposed to require them. Nonetheless, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges that, theoretically, there are a number of ways in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which this proposal could be scaled back even further. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on whether such scaling back would be desirable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, if so, how it could be done. Possible areas for scale-back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requiring only negative, rather than positive records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negative records note only deviations from critical limits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how they are corrected. If a critical control point is under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, no record is made. Admittedly, FDA has reservations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about such an approach. For example, it is virtually impossible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for firms or for FDA to spot trends that could lead to problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if only negative records are being kept. Nonetheless, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on this approach.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Developing generic plans by FDA that list critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points and contain other information for various industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Deleting some or all of the proposed specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Requiring HACCP only for the domestic industry. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP requirements would become the basis for negotiating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements with other countries relating to the equivalency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Deleting or modifying the proposed training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Requiring HACCP for processing hazards only. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadian HACCP system does not involve species-related safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Exempting warehouses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Although only in guidelines (Appendix B, Scombroid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxin-Forming Species), sanctioning the receipt by a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a harvester of an assurance of good handling practices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than detailed time/temperature records. Such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance, without further verification, would be acceptable only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from harvesters with histories of delivering acceptable products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These four alternative approaches to implementing these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Comments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invited on them in combination as well as on them individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Information and Consumer Awareness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requesting comment on alternative approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to HACCP, FDA is taking the opportunity to invite comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general subject of complementary risk reduction activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily directed toward postprocessing handling. Elsewhere in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document, FDA invited comment on the advisability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying HACCP or alternative regulatory approaches to commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities that are not directly subject to these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, i.e., harvesting vessels, common carriers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail establishments (although not necessarily doing so as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this rulemaking). In addition, FDA seeks comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate education and information that should be directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward consumers and recreational fishermen. The commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of HACCP principles can mitigate somewhat the effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of poor consumer handling practices by helping to ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe product reaches the home, but no such program can prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses caused by improper home handling. Similarly, HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practiced by processors can have no effect on recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishermen who consume their own catch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education has always been an important part of FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive seafood safety program, but the agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that more can be done. Recent FDA education projects include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of a seafood hotline, which has been consulted by over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26,000 individuals on a wide range of seafood safety issues since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it began in October 1992. (The hotline can be reached by calling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toll-free, 1&hyph;800&hyph;FDA&hyph;4010.) FDA also recently developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brochures aimed at advising certain medically compromised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations that they should not eat molluscan shellfish without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate cooking. FDA invites comment on other types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education and information activities that might be useful, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including more information that might be made available through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grocery stores, pharmacies, and other establishments, through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
media, and through other means, including labeling. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering the merits of labeling information for consumers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish, and will address this issue in proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate from these regulations. FDA notes that several states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have already mandated, or are in the process of mandating, point- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of-purchase information for raw molluscan shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also invites comment on whether FDA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider proposing to require handling instructions for consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the labeling of seafood. The Department of Agriculture has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed such requirements for meat and poultry (58 FR 58922, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 4, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has a longstanding program to control the levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms of public health concern in seafood. This program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes compliance policies on such levels, including zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels (i.e., none detectable based upon official methods) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria monocytogenes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in all foods. These proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require control of microbial pathogens through HACCP principles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including specific sanitation controls. Even so, FDA recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no system can reduce all risks to zero. Because all foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the home, including seafood, are subject to mishandling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross contamination from other sources, FDA invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general subject of handling instructions. Should FDA decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to propose handling instructions, it would do so as a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal separate from the proposed HACCP requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This proposed rule contains requirements for information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collections which are subject to review by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980. The title, description, and respondent description of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collection are shown below with an estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information requirements in this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are essentially monitoring and recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompassing critical control points in the production and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection of fish and fishery products as established in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans of processors and importers. The specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collected and the frequency of collection will depend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on such factors as the species and the processing conditions. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will include observations of processing parameters such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and temperature of processing and storage; the condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials; the results of chemical and microbiological tests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitation conditions in a processing facility; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective actions taken in response to processing deviations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc. Records identifying production lot codes and date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture will also be maintained. Records will be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the processing facility or at an importer's place of business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1 year after the date of preparation in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated products and at least 2 years for frozen products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information will be used by FDA investigators during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly scheduled inspections of processing plants, or at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of entry of imports, to determine whether products were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed under sanitary conditions and processed, packaged, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored, and distributed using HACCP control techniques to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards that might cause the products to be adulterated. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information will also be used when necessary to trace and remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially hazardous products from the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records of processing conditions will also provide a means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to monitor the quality of their products and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alert them when a deviation from the critical limits established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the HACCP plan has occurred that may create a potential public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health hazard in the final product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The figures provided below reflect an FDA estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual hours of monitoring and recordkeeping based upon currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data and assumptions about the effects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in proposed part 123. The estimate is based on data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to develop cost estimates for the economic impact analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by Executive Order 12866 and thus is subject to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of uncertainties described elsewhere in this preamble. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the agency has anecdotal evidence that the burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms that are operating under a mandatory HACCP system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the State of Alaska is more nominal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA acknowledges the possibility that the estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided here are conservatively high, indicating recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens that are higher than would customarily be the case. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically invites comments on this point.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 compels agencies to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-benefit analysis as a component of decisionmaking. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act requires regulatory relief for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses where feasible. FDA finds that this proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes a major rule under both Executive Order 12866 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act. A summary of the preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory impact analysis (PRIA), which may be obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dockets Management Branch (address above), is presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 requires Federal agencies to justify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for regulations by demonstrating that the problem that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation is designed to remedy cannot be adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by measures other than Federal regulation. In its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of such alternatives, FDA finds that the current system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(periodic inspection plus sampling of a small proportion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood), coupled with the uncertainty in estimating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses related to seafood, has not adequately ensured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers that a minimum level of safety has been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the tort system is not able to provide remedies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsafe seafood, the price system provides some differentiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between products based on brands and retail reputation. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the price system works in conjunction with current Federal regulation which signals consumers as to a minimum level
of seafood safety. As is argued in the preamble, countless public arguments and attempts at legislation imply that
the minimum levels that some consumers believe they are getting (those that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not search for higher levels) is probably higher than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual levels of seafood safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tort system fails because consumers are often unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trace either the source of their foodborne illness to seafood, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and even where that is possible, it is often difficult to trace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood to a specific company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Regulatory Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has evaluated multiple options to address the compelling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest in further ensuring seafood safety. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options include: (1) Maintaining the existing approach_``snapshot'' inspections and sampling; (2) significantly

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the frequency of both snapshot inspections and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling under the existing approach; (3) beginning a voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP program in addition to the existing approach; (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning mandatory HACCP for high risk products only, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the existing approach; (5) beginning mandatory HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all seafood (the proposed approach); (6) beginning a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive mandatory HACCP program than that proposed, similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP), which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include all CGMP's, quality factors, and economic fraud as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points; and (7) beginning a mandatory water-to-table HACCP program which would include all vessels,
carriers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retail food operators.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The existing approach does not adequately address the compelling public interest in further ensuring seafood safety
because sampling the large volume of seafood with FDA's limited resources cannot detect many violative products.
Increasing the frequency of sampling and inspections is also unlikely to resolve this problem without significant
increases in funding. These options are discussed extensively in the preamble to the proposed regulations and in
the PRIA. The third option, voluntary HACCP, has been in existence at NOAA and has very few participants. The forth
option, risk-based HACCP, has been evaluated in the PRIA in several forms, including HACCP only for the highest risk
products from a historical perspective and HACCP only for those products with the potential for catastrophic risk.
For example, one possibility evaluated under this option would be to implement HACCP solely for molluscan shellfish,
which NAS and other groups have concluded constitute most of the risk from seafood. The sixth option is more costly
than the proposed option and includes more reliance on CGMP's. Finally, the last option involves mandatory HACCP
for nearly 1 million establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The options evaluated in the PRIA have both lower and higher costs than the proposed option. However, the benefits
of all options are not equal to the proposed option. FDA has quantified net benefits of some of the high risk options
and has found them to have been positive net benefits for those costs and benefits which have been quantified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These options are not all equal in terms of costs and benefits. They differ significantly from one another in this regard,
as well as from the option that FDA has selected to propose as new part 123. They are also not equal in their ability to
meet all the regulatory objectives stated in the preamble, including effective treatment of imports and an appropriate
alignment of industry and government responsibilities. FDA seeks comment on the costs and benefits as well as on the
general pros and cons of all the stated options and on any options that the agency may have overlooked. It is extremely
important that FDA's evaluation of regulatory options be as thorough as possible for purposes of developing a final
rule, and that the agency be able to fully articulate the distinctions among them and the significance of those distinctions.

B. Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
There is no single source of data that FDA has found to be entirely satisfactory for developing a preliminary estimate
of the costs of the proposed regulations. Consequently, FDA has considered two sources of information, each with
its own strengths and weaknesses. The results provide a range of possibilities, and FDA invites comment on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first source is U.S. seafood processors that have actually implemented HACCP systems. The number of such firms
may exceed 100. Understandably, many firms are reluctant to make public detailed information about the costs of operation;
consequently, the information available to FDA from this source is incomplete. On the other hand, there is enough
information from which some preliminary conclusions can be drawn that are relevant to an economic assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second source is a study of the costs of implementing a form of HACCP that was developed by the Department of Commerce
for the congressionally mandated MSSP. That study was performed by an independent contractor for the National Fisheries
Education and Research Foundation, Inc., and commissioned under a grant from NMFS. While these data are the most detailed
available, fitting them to the proposed regulations required extensive adjustments and extrapolations. Thus,
these data also fail to eliminate the considerable uncertainty of the results as they relate to these proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Costs: Actual Industry Experience
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has some information relevant to the actual costs of implementing HACCP experienced by a number of seafood firms.
While this information is neither detailed nor complete enough to definitively answer the question of how much the
proposed regulations will cost the industry, it does provide insight into the costs of the proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information includes responses to a 1991 evaluation questionnaire from four of the eight firms that participated
in the FDA/NOAA seafood HACCP pilot in 1990&hyph;1991 (Ref. 40). It also includes information more recently provided
to FDA from seven firms through the assistance of NFPA, and from two trade associations. The trade associations, the
NFI and the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) provided FDA with summary information about member
firms that were implementing HACCP systems. NEFDA has operated a HACCP pilot with member firms through a Federal grant.
The two trade associations provided information on 16 firms. The seven firms that provided information about themselves
through NFPA operate a total of 44 processing plants, so FDA has information on at least 64 plants (Ref. 129).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firms represent a good cross section of processing operation types, including canned, fresh, frozen, smoked/salted,
and cooked, ready-to-eat products as well as molluscan shellfish. The majority of firms were involved in HACCP as
participants in either pilot programs, the NOAA fee-for-service program, or the State of Alaska program, and therefore
have been subject to some form of third party verification of their HACCP systems. Virtually all of them developed
HACCP plans, and the majority of these included critical control points for quality or economic fraud or both in addition
to safety. In this respect, the majority of firms implemented a more extensive form of HACCP than is being proposed
by FDA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Presumably, start-up costs for HACCP are normally higher than operating costs in subsequent years. The majority
of firms that could estimate their own start-up costs indicated costs in the $1,000 to $5,000 range. The remaining
minority appear to be roughly equally divided between lower and higher costs. A few firms indicated costs in the $20,000
or higher range. These may be firms that decided to hire additional personnel in order to install or implement HACCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the cost figures that come from firms that operate more than one plant are for the total costs
of their plants collectively; in order to calculate the average start-up cost per plant for these firms, their costs
would have to be divided by the number of plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly twice as many firms did not hire additional personnel or did not anticipate hiring additional personnel as
a result of operating HACCP systems as those who did or felt the need to do so. The overwhelming majority of firms reported
that they believed that the advantages they derived from HACCP were worth the costs to them in terms of better control
over their operations, better sanitation, and greater efficiencies, such as reduced waste. Virtually all foresaw
long-term benefits from operating under HACCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that there are several uncertainties with this data. The first is that FDA does not know the extent of previous
HACCP-type activities in these firms so that they may have different incremental costs than the industry average.
In addition, these firms may have been relatively larger firms so that they may not be fully representative of the industry.
Also, FDA does not know whether or not these firms would necessarily be in full compliance with the proposed regulations
so that additional costs might have to be expended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Costs: MSSP Study
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The MSSP study provides FDA with survey data from which detailed cost estimates have been made in the PRIA, subject
to numerous uncertainties. As this is the largest and only randomly selected data base available to FDA, the PRIA relied
primarily on estimates based on these data. The contractor in the MSSP study sent teams into 130 processing plants,
none of which were operating under HACCP systems, to project the costs to each plant to implement and operate a form
of HACCP chosen for that study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In areas where FDA had better data than that used in the contractor reports, the agency has used information available
from its field surveys on current practices or conditions in the industry in general, and it has substituted that information
for the information gathered from the sample plants in the contractor reports. Where gaps in the contractor estimates
exist that could not be filled in by information from FDA field surveys, a number of assumptions have been made for the
purposes of this economic assessment. FDA views the cost estimates extrapolated from the contractor reports and
other sources as preliminary and requests comments on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From FDA's 1992 official establishment inventory, FDA has estimated that there are 4,846 domestic seafood manufacturing
plants that will be affected by the proposed rule. Thirty-three percent of the first year costs can be attributed to
expenditures necessary to comply with the HACCP-based sanitation provisions of the proposed rule. Another 36 percent
are attributable to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. In addition, approximately 31 percent of the first
year costs are for equipment such as temperature indicators, temperature recorders, and can seam tear-down machines.
Additional costs are for HACCP training, consulting by processing authorities, writing HACCP plans, instituting
operational changes, responding to critical limit deviations, and analytical testing. The average expected cost
of the proposed rule per domestic manufacturing plant is estimated to be $23,900 in the first year ($24,000 for small
plants, $23,400 for large plants) and $15,000 in the following years ($14,700 for small plants and $15,700 for large
plants). Total costs of the proposed rule for domestic manufacturers are estimated to be $117 million in the first
year and $65 million in the following years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA estimates that 924 importers will bear start-up costs of approximately $8 million, and 1,571 repackers
and warehouses will bear annual recurring costs of $14 million. Therefore, based on these data, FDA estimates domestic
costs for this rule to be $139 million in the first year and $79 million in succeeding years. Discounted domestic costs
are estimated to be $676 million over 10 years (6 percent). FDA also estimates that 8,125 foreign processors will have
initial costs of $96 million and recurring costs of $44 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Should smoked fish products be required to bear refrigeration statements on their labels, the maximum possible cost
to this industry segment would be estimated to be $2.5 million for a label redesign for all products. A label redesign
would be likely only in the case of extensive refrigeration instructions. If a simple statement such as ``keep refrigerated''
were to be required, then the cost to the smoked fish industry would be approximately $168,000 because approximately
75 percent of the products currently bear such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates are considerably higher than the estimates from data submitted to FDA from seafood plants as discussed
above. These differences may be attributable to several factors. For example, the MSSP-based estimates also include
estimated costs of compliance by processors with pre-existing sanitation requirements in part 110 and costs of complying
with guidelines that are appended to these proposed regulations. Although these costs are not inherent to the operation
of a HACCP system, they represent one-third of the total MSSP-based estimates. As indicated earlier in this document,
compliance with CGMP's for sanitation has been a continuing problem across the industry. For this reason, FDA is proposing
specific sanitation requirements in subpart A of part 123.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the estimate of costs associated with complying with guidelines in the appendices may be overstated because,
in actuality, FDA may find industry practices other than those stated in the guidelines to be acceptable. The guidelines
are intended to provide the industry with information on how it could implement HACCP, not how it must do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs to importers and to foreign processors that ship to the United States were also estimated. In the absence of reliable
data for estimating costs to foreign processors, FDA estimated the number of plants that export seafood to the United
States and based their costs of implementing HACCP on MSSP- generated data on the costs to U.S. plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to recognize that many of the United States major seafood trading partners are using, or have opted
for, HACCP programs. For example, the EC will soon require HACCP or an equivalent system from over 100 nations that
export to it. Consequently, with the current trend toward HACCP worldwide, the costs to many foreign processors of
implementing HACCP may be incurred regardless of whether FDA issued these proposed regulations. Moreover, in the
near future, U.S. importers subject to this proposed rule should have little difficulty finding products produced
under HACCP. FDA specifically invites comment on the estimated costs of the proposed regulations to importers and
foreign processors, e.g., whether they are high due to the worldwide move toward HACCP or whether they are low due to
other factors that have not been considered, and the potential effect on U.S. consumers of requiring that imports
be produced under HACCP systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRIA presumes that most of the cost of compliance of the proposed regulations will be passed on to consumers. Estimating
the magnitude of these price increases is difficult. U.S. consumers spent about $16.5 billion on domestically produced
seafood in 1991 (Ref. 42). If the domestic industry passed on all of the estimated annual costs to consumers, prices
for domestically produced seafood would increase by less than 1 percent in the first year and less than one-half of
1 percent in succeeding years. Price changes of such magnitude are unlikely to have a major impact on general seafood
purchases. However, some regional price increases may considerably exceed this. In addition, this estimation of
change in price does not address potential concentration effects. It is worth noting that the contractor that performed
the MSSP study estimated a range of cost increases from negligible to 1.3 percent, depending on the type of product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect on prices of imported products is impossible to estimate. While the PRIA uses MSSP data and a number of assumptions
to estimate possible costs to foreign processors of complying with the proposed regulations, those costs will be
spread among the consumers from all nations to which these processors export. FDA is unable to estimate what percentage
of these costs would be passed on to U.S. consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other side of the ledger, the MSSP-based estimates were not able to include costs associated with some features
of the proposed rules because data were lacking. An inventory of these features is provided in the PRIA, and FDA invites
comment on possible costs associated with them. They include prevention of cross contamination by the separation
of food contact surfaces, storage at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F of cooked, ready-to-eat products and products that are made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species,
and the costs of following the approach presented in the guidelines at Appendix B for scombroid toxin forming species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This proposed action will reduce the amount of illness that derives from consumption of seafood (safety benefits)
and may have significant nutrition benefits that result from increased consumption of seafood. The increased consumption
will result from a decrease in consumer anxiety associated with the consumption of seafood. In addition, there may
be significant cost savings (benefits) in other areas as a result of adoption of this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of a national, mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system for seafood should have a beneficial, although
nonquantifiable effect on both the industry and the Federal government. FDA knows from experience that continuing
concerns about the adequacy of the current Federal regulatory system for seafood place a financial stress on industry,
which must constantly defend itself from criticism, and on regulatory agencies such as FDA, which must divert resources
in order to respond to the Congress and the media. While public interest in food safety is healthy and desirable, the
extreme interest in seafood safety, which has manifested itself in over 10 congressional hearings and over 20 pieces
of legislation in the past 5 years, demonstrates how a system that is less than fully adequate from the public's standpoint
can cause a steady diversion of both public and private resources that is likely to continue in the absence of a system
that overcomes current inefficiencies and shortcomings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there will be an additional benefit to firms wishing to export seafood to those countries which require federally
monitored HACCP. The latter two benefits have not been quantified, and FDA requests comments on how this might be done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency followed three steps to quantify the safety benefits of HACCP for processors: (1) Identify all significant
hazards associated with seafood safety and establish the baseline number of incidents of each hazard in the U.S. population;
(2) estimate the reduction in the number of incidents of each hazard that HACCP is expected to accomplish; and (3) quantify
the benefit of the reduced illnesses and deaths. In all three steps, FDA acknowledges that there is substantial uncertainty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, to establish a baseline number of illnesses, FDA reviewed both reported data to the CDCP, which provides a lower
bound on the actual number of cases, and an earlier FDA risk assessment that estimated an upper-bound number of cases.
Using information about the probable amount of underreporting for each type of illness, FDA constructed a likely
baseline number for each type of illness by inflating these numbers between zero and 1,000 times the amount reported.
Thus, for example, while it is likely that nearly all cases of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) are reported to
CDCP, it is likely that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylobacter jejuni
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is underreported by approximately 100 times the actual number of cases. This approach for estimating cases yielded
an estimated 33,000 cases of illness from seafood per year. However, FDA acknowledges that even a reasonably precise
estimate of the number of illnesses cannot be determined with the existing foodborne disease reporting mechanisms
in this country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second step, FDA used a panel of internal experts to determine the number of illnesses the proposed regulations
are likely to reduce.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For example, it is not likely to reduce any cases of NSP because they are primarily associated with recreational fishing.
On the other hand, it is likely to reduce over 50 percent of scombroid poisoning because most of the mishandling of seafood
comes either at the catch or processing stages. This action will not reduce any cases that are a result of consumer or
retailer mishandling but, as explained earlier in this document, problems at the retail level are addressed through
mechanisms outside of this proposed regulation. FDA has estimated that between 5,000 and 19,000 cases of seafood
illness and death will be reduced by the proposed action annually.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the third step, FDA used economic valuation techniques to quantify the effect of reducing the range of cases of seafood
illness. This technique combines costs of illness, such as hospital costs, with the costs of pain and suffering in
a reduced health state to estimate the cost of each hazard. Thus, for example, NSP, with very mild symptoms, has a low
cost per case ($270), whereas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio vulnificus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with a high probability of death, has a very high cost ($1.3 million per case). Using this methodology, the total safety
benefits of the proposed option are valued between $15 and $75 million per year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has also evaluated the potential health benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with increased consumption of seafood. Because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative publicity concerning water pollution and seafood safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer perception of seafood safety may overestimate actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk. In addition, contamination scares cause drastic short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drops in consumer demand for seafood products and undoubtedly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to the chronic level of consumer concern about seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. Thus, safety concerns about seafood are a likely factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing wider consumer acceptance of seafood as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this proposal is finalized, consumer concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood safety may be reduced which may, in turn, lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased consumption of seafood. FDA has evaluated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility that consumers may switch from higher fat flesh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein, such as meat and poultry, to seafood. The resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced dietary fat in the diet of the general population would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the same methodology employed in an earlier analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA analyzed the benefits of a 1- and 5-pound per capita increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in consumption of seafood. These were estimated to decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deaths by 673 and 2,782, respectively, over a 10-year period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule will have a substantial impact on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood processors as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighty percent of the seafood processors covered by this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation are small, where small is defined for nonshrimp firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as less than $1 million in annual gross revenue and less than $2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million for shrimp firms. The provisions of this rule, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and recordkeeping, are largely fixed costs (costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which do not vary significantly with the amount of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced) which will impose larger per unit costs on small rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than on large businesses. In addition, small firms may have as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many critical control points as large firms because critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points tend to be related to the complexity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, not the size of the business. However, it may be that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller firms are less complex than large firms, although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency does not have sufficient data to determine if this is so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases the increase in cost will be large enough to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause some firms to go out of business. For example, estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of firm failure have been as low as 2 percent (96 firms) of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms (from the Canadian experience) to 334 firms (estimated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with MSSP). However, FDA does not have enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to estimate the number of firms that will close if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several factors that affect the ability of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors to comply with the proposed regulations. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic HACCP requirements proposed in subpart A of part 123 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberately include only the essentials of HACCP in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keep fixed costs to a minimum. Second, FDA is developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable guidance in the form of a hazard guide and model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans to enable small processors to implement an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system at the lowest possible cost. Third, FDA is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware that academia and trade associations are available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist processors to implement HACCP. Finally, for those small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors that have very simple operations requiring few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points, an inherent feature of HACCP is that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusts to the complexity and risks of an operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While any closure is regrettable, the agency strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that firms that are unable to identify the likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards associated with their products and take reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls to prevent those hazards from occurring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be selling food in interstate commerce. As described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the preamble, FDA is keenly interested in keeping the costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing HACCP to a minimum and is issuing guidance documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and model HACCP plans to facilitate such implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is specifically requesting comment in areas where costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and benefit estimates are either very uncertain or potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large. FDA will utilize answers received on these comments along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all other comments to help formulate the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA specifically requests comments on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The expected cost to retrofit plants as necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proper operation of HACCP controls (e.g., enhance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerator capacity, water supply changes, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost of taking corrective actions to respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limit deviations on an annual basis. FDA has estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an average of $1,000 per firm to take such actions as discarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, buying new equipment, and changing the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The cost of training employees. FDA has estimated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there will be a cost per plant of $900 to train an employee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manage HACCP. This will include the cost of training, travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses, and loss of several days of productivity for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee. Not all of these costs may be borne by manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, because some training may be sponsored by academia, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade associations, and others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The cost of ensuring that cooking and pasteurizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and processes are achieving the desired safety results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., destroying microbiological pathogens). This ensurance may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be obtained by having equipment and processes that are equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those found effective by a processing authority. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated that this would cost $1,000 per plant in the first year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, on average, half that amount in the following years as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors change their processes and equipment. This cost may be offset, however, by reliance on literature that
contains the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary information from a processing authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The cost of temperature indicators and thermometers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants who do not now have this equipment. FDA estimated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost would be $1,000 per plant, initially, with replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The cost of creating a HACCP plan from the guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by FDA. FDA estimated that it will take processors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simpler processes 24 hours of managerial time to adapt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance into a HACCP plan. FDA estimated that it will take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors with more complex processes 72 hours of managerial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to adapt the guidance into a HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) FDA requests comment on the recordkeeping burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the proposed sanitation requirements in &sect;123.10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) and (c). If possible, such estimates should be provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of hours spent and translated into dollars if staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation rates are known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA was unable to provide cost estimates of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following provisions and requests specific comments on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Appendix A.6., cooling after cooking; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Appendix B., scombroid toxin forming species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Appendix 1., specifically, the guidance on smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fishery products; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Increased short-term recall potential, if any, due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heightened industry awareness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Increasing time spent escorting Federal inspectors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly in the initial phases; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The cost of restricting catch in certain areas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasons if processors find it necessary.

(1) FDA is reprinting two tables from the PRIA and requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on both the baseline number of illnesses due to seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the likelihood that HACCP for processors will reduce those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses. The baseline number of illnesses reflects an estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all cases (from any source, including recreational harvest, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail, and consumer mishandling). FDA considers the estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in both tables as preliminary estimates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) FDA also specifically requests comments on the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cases of illness included in the baseline estimate (33,035) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may be due to factors outside the processors' control, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as those due to recreational harvests (that are not eventually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sent to processors), those due to restaurants and supermarkets, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and those due to consumer mishandling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) As mentioned above, FDA has also estimated potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits associated with increased seafood consumption. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits will only be realized if the price increase resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from this rule does not offset the effect of increased demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood which will result from reduced consumer anxiety. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests specific comment on the likelihood that seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption will be increased as a result of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) FDA has identified but not quantified benefits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood exporters as well as reduced public anxiety associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the safety of seafood. FDA requests comments on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits (including how to quantify them) as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential benefits such as how HACCP will help firms gain better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control over their operations, better sanitation and greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies such as reduced product waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
E. Tribal Governments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA is aware that some tribal governments are involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of seafood for interstate commerce. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that the proposed regulations will apply to them in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. Executive Order 12875 of October 26, 1993, requires, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among other things, consultation with tribal governments before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formal promulgation of regulations containing unfunded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal mandates. While FDA does not believe that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations would impose an unfunded Federal mandate, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishes to foster consultation on matters that might significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect tribal communities. Consequently, FDA specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the economic effect of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on tribal governments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
F. Availability of PRIA/RFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA acknowledges considerable uncertainty in both cost and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit estimates of the proposed regulations and requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on all aspects of the PRIA and the RFA. The full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRIA/RIA is available at the Dockets Management Branch (address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
XI. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action will not have a significant impact on the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

XII. Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1994, submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in

whether these products have been processed under sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Every processor and importer shall have and implement a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written HACCP plan that is specific to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each location where fish and fishery products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed by that processor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each kind of fish and fishery product processed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. The plan may group kinds of fish and fishery products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together if the hazards, critical control points, critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits, and procedures required to be identified in paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section are identical for all fish and fishery products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so grouped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The HACCP plan shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify the safety hazards that are reasonably likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to occur and that thus must be controlled for each fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery product, including, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Natural toxins; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Microbiological contamination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Chemical contamination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Pesticides; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Drug residues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Decomposition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Parasites; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Unapproved direct and indirect food and color 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Physical hazards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Identify the critical control points for each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified hazards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identify the critical limits that must be met at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the critical control points; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Identify the procedures, and frequency thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the use of consumer complaints received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer, that will be used to control and monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the critical control points to ensure compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits. Such procedures shall include the calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of process control instruments and validation of software for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer control systems as appropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Provide for a recordkeeping system that will document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the monitoring of the critical control points. The records shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain the actual values obtained during monitoring. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records shall also include consumer complaints that relate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of critical control points or possible critical limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, the HACCP plan should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify other consumer hazards not related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of the product, including, but not necessarily limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Decomposition not associated with human illness; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Economic adulteration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide for control of these hazards in the manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Failure of a processor or importer to have and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement an HACCP plan that complies with this section or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate in accordance with the requirements of this part, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
render the products of that processor or importer adulterated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

Corrective actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any critical limit deviation shall require: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Segregation and holding of the affected product, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least until the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section are met; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Immediate review by an individual or individuals who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been trained in accordance with &sect;123.9, to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptability of the lot in question for distribution, based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment as to whether the deviation may have rendered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product in that lot injurious to health or otherwise adulterated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Corrective action, when necessary, with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected product and the critical control point at which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation occurred; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Timely assessment by an individual or individuals who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been trained in accordance with &sect;123.9, to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the process or Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HACCP) plan needs to be modified to reduce the risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurrence of the deviation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Modification when necessary as it applies to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When a processor or importer receives a consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint that may be related to the performance of a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point or that may reflect a critical limit deviation, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall determine whether corrective action as described by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a) of this section is appropriate and, if so, it shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All actions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section shall be documented in records that are subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;123.8.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Other such verification measures as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An importer's obligation under paragraph (c) of this section will be satisfied if the importer imports product
from a country that has an active memorandum of understanding (MOU), or similar agreement, with FDA that documents
the equivalency of the inspection system of the foreign country with the U.S. system. The active MOU will be expected
to accurately reflect the current situation between the signing parties and be functioning and enforceable in its
entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Importers should encourage foreign processors to obtain HACCP training similar to that required by &sect;123.9.

in a final container, or to pasteurization in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final container, or to both. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance involves processing procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are common to most of these products for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the microbiological hazards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they are particularly susceptible. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance does not apply to environmental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hazards that might occur before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor takes possession of the product or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials. (Guidance on these hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be found in a separate guidance document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all fish and fishery products to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by FDA.) This guidance also does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to cooked, ready-to-eat fishery

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Cooking Process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be able to demonstrate to itself and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA that its cooking process ensures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction of vegetative cells of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms of public health concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This may be accomplished by having a cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that is at least equivalent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process established by a process authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To demonstrate equivalence, a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have on file in its Hazard Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical Control Point (HACCP) records a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Describes the results of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific evaluation, conducted by a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, of the adequacy of the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Identifies and establishes values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for key aspects of the process or of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product that may affect the adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction of microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern. At a minimum, these values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include cooking times and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a document may consist of, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be limited to, a letter from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority, articles in scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
journals, or Federal, State, or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government regulations or advisories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to have documentation that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking process will achieve its goal will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violate 21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product produced by the processor will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced under insanitary conditions whereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it may be rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Cooking Equipment Design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The processor must be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking equipment can deliver the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that ensures the destruction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetative cells of microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern. One way to accomplish this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is for the processor to have on file in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP records a document that describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of a scientific evaluation, conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a process authority, of the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the type of equipment and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational procedures used by the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The engineering specifications for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment used by the processor (e.g., pipe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes, flow rates, loading configuration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, whenever a steam process is used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
venting parameters) should meet or exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those for the equipment evaluated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority. Failure to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the cooking equipment will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 123.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will mean that the product produced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor will be produced under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Cooking equipment should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with both a temperature-indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and temperature-recording device. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device should be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference instrument for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformance to the established process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring records made by the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should record both the actual values that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring for those key aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process identified by the process authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 4.a.1. of this Appendix and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual values that are occurring for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational procedures identified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority in section 4.a.2.i. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Special Considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For the cooking of blue crab 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Callinectes sapidus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), dungeness crab (

Cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), or king crab (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Paralithodes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
camtschatica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), the known lethality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking process necessary to make the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally acceptable for human consumption, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to enable further processing, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient so that the adequacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process and the equipment can normally be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Pasteurization Process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must be able to demonstrate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself and to FDA that its pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process ensures the adequate reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers of viable spores of microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern. One way to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is to have a pasteurization process that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is equivalent to a process established by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority. To demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalence, a processor should have on file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its HACCP records a document that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 i. Describes the results of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific evaluation conducted by a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of the adequacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process; and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. Identifies and establishes values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those key aspects of the process, or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, that may affect the adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in numbers of microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern. At a minimum, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values should include pasteurization times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Such document may consist of, but should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be limited to, a letter from a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, articles in scientific journals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Federal, State or local government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations or advisories. Failure to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the pasteurization process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123.8 and will mean that the product produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the processor will be produced under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered injurious to health.

scientific evaluation conducted by a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, of the design and operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of equipment used by the processor. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering specifications for the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by the processor (e.g., pipe sizes, flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, loading configuration) should meet or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed those for the equipment evaluated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process authority. Failure to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment will achieve its goals will violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by the processor will be produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. Pasteurization equipment should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with both a temperature-indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and temperature-recording device. The

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Finished product containers must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected, and the results recorded, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container integrity to assure a consistently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable hermetic seal. FDA recommends that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Visual seam inspection of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container from each seaming head occur every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 minutes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. Testing by qualified personnel of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one container from each seaming head occur at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least every 4 hours. As applicable, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests should be performed in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 CFR 113.60(a)(1) and (a)(2).

a. Temperature-Indicating Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Temperature-indicating devices should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed where they can be easily read and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located to ensure that they accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure the warmest temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration equipment and the coldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the heating equipment, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Temperature-indicating devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be calibrated at the routine operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the refrigeration, cooling, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment against a known accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard thermometer upon installation and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least once a year thereafter, or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently, if necessary, to ensure their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy. Records required to be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 21 CFR 123.8 of accuracy checks for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating devices should specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date, standard used, method used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results, and person performing the test. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided fluid column or that cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted to the standard should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately repaired or replaced.

b. Temperature-Recording Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Temperature-recording devices should be installed where they can be easily read and the sensors for such devices
should be installed to ensure that they accurately measure the warmest temperature of the refrigeration equipment
and the coldest temperature of the heating equipment, as appropriate. Computerized storage of temperature data
may be used in place of recorder thermometer charts if the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to be
substantially equivalent to the use of a temperature-recording device. Each temperature-recording device should
be checked for accuracy at the beginning and end of each production day and adjusted as necessary to agree as nearly
as possible with the reference temperature-indicating device. A record of these accuracy checks should be maintained
that specifies the time, date, temperatures indicated by both devices before adjustment, corrective action taken,
where applicable, and person performing the accuracy check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Corrective Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 21 CFR 123.7, whenever a deviation occurs at a critical control point, the processor shall segregate and hold
the product until a review can be made to determine the effect of that deviation, and shall take corrective action as
necessary. For cooked, ready-to-eat products, when a deviation occurs at a cooking or pasteurization critical control
point, the processor should meet the requirements of &sect;123.7 either by destroying the product; by fully reprocessing,
where possible, that portion of the production involved, keeping full records of the reprocessing conditions; or
by setting aside that portion of the product involved for further evaluation as to any potential public health significance.
Such an evaluation should be made by a process authority and should be in accordance with procedures recognized by
process authorities as being adequate to detect any unacceptable hazard to public health. Unless this evaluation
demonstrates that the product had been given a thermal process that rendered it free of microorganisms of potential
public health significance or, in the case of pasteurization, that resulted in the adequate reduction in numbers
of microorganisms, the product set aside should be either fully reprocessed to correct the deficiency or destroyed.
A record should be made of the evaluation procedures used and the results. Either upon completion of full reprocessing
or after the determination that no significant public health hazard exists, that portion of the product involved
may be shipped in normal distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the product involved should be destroyed.

9. Sanitary Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 123.10, sanitary zones should be established around areas in which cooked
product is handled or stored. In such areas, objects and employees that have come into contact with waste, raw product,
or other insanitary objects are excluded. Packaging material, equipment, employees, and in-process materials
that enter a sanitary zone should be treated in a manner that will minimize the risk of the introduction of microorganisms.
Air handling systems should be designed to minimize the risk of airborne contamination and to provide positive air
pressure in the sanitary zone relative to the surrounding areas.

1. General Guidelines for Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix provides guidance on how to meet the requirements of 21 CFR part 123, subpart A for fish and fishery products
that consist in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species. These include tuna, bluefish, mahi mahi, mackerel,
sardines, herring, kahawai, anchovies, marlin, and other species, whether or not of the family Scombridae, in which
significant levels of histamine may be produced in the fish flesh by decarboxylation of free histidine as a result
of exposure of the fish after capture to temperatures that permit the growth of mesophilic bacteria. The guidance
focuses on preventing the formation of scombrotoxin, which can be harmful to humans, as a consequence of improper
handling after capture, i.e., time and temperature abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Critical Control Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Every processor who engages in processing other than, or in addition to, storing of fish or fishery products that consist
in whole or in part of scombroid forming species, must ensure that neither decomposition leading to histamine formation,
nor histamine formation, has occurred before receipt of such fish or fishery products. Processors must also ensure
that neither decomposition leading to histamine formation, nor histamine formation, occurs as a result of inadequate
handling practices by the processor. In order to prevent these hazards from occurring, Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point (HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with 21 CFR part 123, subpart A will typically identify and address
the receipt of raw materials, as well as processing, as critical control points. In accordance with 21 CFR part 123,
subpart A, processors shall identify in their HACCP plans how they will control hazards at critical control points.
This appendix provides guidance on how to do so with respect to scombroid toxin forming species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
On-board handling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The first processor to take ownership after harvest of fish and fishery products of scombroid toxin forming species
should ensure that vessels supplying such fish have in place measures to ensure that the fish were rapidly brought
to, and maintained at, an internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below, and were not held for a period of time sufficient to allow histamine formation to begin at the temperature
at which they were held. The processor may determine the time and temperature history of the fish by requiring certification
of the fishing method and on-board handling practices, and a time/temperature log from the harvesting vessel. The
time/temperature log should record, for each lot of fish, the date of harvest, fishing method, temperature of the
harvest water, and temperature history of the fish relating to the lowering of the internal temperature. The temperature
history of the fish may be documented by controlling and recording the key aspects of the cooling and storage operation
(e.g., refrigerated brine or seawater temperature, fish size, and container packing). For purposes of this guideline,
a lot of fish is the fish in a vessel storage compartment (i.e., well, tote, or other container). The log should be sufficient
to enable the processor to determine whether the fish were subject to conditions in the water after capture, on the
harvesting vessel, or in storage, that could cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine in
the fish.

Sampling and examination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, as described in section 3.a.1. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Appendix, should subject a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of fish in each lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel to an external organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination for decomposition and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record the results of the examination. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample should provide at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 percent confidence that decomposition does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exist in more than 2.5 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish in the lot. If the number of fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a vessel is small enough to permit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of each fish, e.g., because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight of each fish is typically greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 pounds, the processor is encouraged to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examine each fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Any fish that exhibits decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should either be rejected and not used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food, or reconditioned according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's established procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconditioning should include, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of all parts of the fish that exhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any decomposition, organoleptic reexamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the remaining fish flesh, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of a histamine analysis on the

remaining fish flesh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. If no decomposition in any fish in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lot is detected through organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination, the following should apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unlikely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish, all the fish from that lot may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further processed or enter commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were likely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a lot, or if no adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature log is available, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis should be made on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of fish from that lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. If decomposition is detected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following should apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unlikely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a particular lot, those fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot found to have decomposition should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated in accordance with section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.i. of this Appendix. Other fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot may be further processed or enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were likely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a particular lot, or if no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate time/temperature log is available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor should perform a histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis on a representative sample of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptically acceptable fish from that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot. (However, if the processor elects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform a histamine analysis on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of each lot of fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel before conducting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic analysis for decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, for example, the processor received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a frozen state, the histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis does not have to be repeated based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on results of subsequent organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. If decomposition is detected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular lot, the processor should perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a histamine analysis on a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample of organoleptically acceptable fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that lot.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. If any fish from a particular lot is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to have histamine above a defect action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level or other regulatory level or limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine established by FDA, the fish in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot may not be used for food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. If any fish from a particular lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is found to have histamine below the defect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action level or other regulatory level or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit for histamine established by FDA but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above levels expected of fresh fish, the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that lot should enter commerce only if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first immediately cooked to prevent histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from increasing to unacceptable levels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent processors who take ownership of

fish and fish products of scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species and who engage in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than, or in addition to, storage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should subject a representative sample each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot of such fish and fishery products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic evaluation for decomposition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether decomposition occurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during transfer from the previous processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any fish that exhibits decomposition should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated in accordance with section

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. A finding of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptically detectable decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should result in the organoleptic examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the entire lot. If decomposition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected in more than 2.5 percent of the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the lot, the processor should perform a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis on a representative sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fish from the lot. The results should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated in accordance with section 3.a.3. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Processing Critical Control Point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products that are undergoing processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be exposed to ambient temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative total of 4 hours. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should ensure that this requirement is met by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and recording, at least every 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, the length of time that the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix provides guidance on how a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor can use an HACCP-based approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that all fish and fishery products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in compliance with the economic adulteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and misbranding provisions of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 402(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 403, respectively). This guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies to controlling economic factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the identity of species, weight, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count and size, and the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable constituents. These factors must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately represented on the label and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of a food.

a. Receipt of Raw Material
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor must ensure that the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fishery products that it receives are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly identified as to species at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point of receipt into its processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Methods used for identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon receipt may include, but are not limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided for by section 303(c)(2) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.12 and 7.13).

b. Labeling-Economic Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor must ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product labels, labeling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoices accurately represent the weight, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count, and size of the product, as well as the presence and amount of any valuable constituents. An example would be
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling of shrimp and breading material to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make breaded shrimp. The processor must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the shrimp has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated by the addition of water, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the valuable constituents are present at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels that are consistent with FDA standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of identity (21 CFR part 161) and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy guides. The processor thus should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for monitoring of the level of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable constituents throughout receipt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing, and distribution to ensure that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Identification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The species is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly identified by its common or usual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name and is so represented on the label and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling. Guidance in selecting the correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common or usual name of a species is provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the FDA Fish List. Specific requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are given in 21 CFR 101.18 and 21 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
161. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Valuable constituents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The valuable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents of the product are not omitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or abstracted from the product (e.g., breaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp contains the required weight ratio of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp to breading and, if appropriate, shrimp of the size and weight specified on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label or labeling). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Substitution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 No substance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted wholly or in part for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable constituent (e.g., through added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water or glazing, or substitution of crab 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavored surimi for crab meat in a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled as crab cake). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Damage or inferiority. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Damage or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inferiority is not concealed in any manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., through bleaching or coloring of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to conceal its true nature or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of wholesomeness). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Product adulteration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is added to, or mixed with, the product to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase its bulk or weight or to reduce its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality, or make it appear of better or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater value than it is (e.g., through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding water to a product by chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other means).

FDA is in the process of developing guidance to, among

other things, assist the seafood industry develop and implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP systems. The guidance will be titled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Controls Guide.'' When a draft of the entire Guide is completed in the near future, FDA will publish a notice

One page each from the ``Vertebrate'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Invertebrate Hazard and Control Lists.'' Together, these lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain about 350 species of commercially marketed fish. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list is in the form of a chart that directs the reader to one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more of the 10 numbered hazard and control descriptions elsewhere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Guide for species-related hazards. For purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guide, species-related hazards are those that can occur in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment or during harvest. Processors should find in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate list the species they handle, then turn to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbered hazard and control descriptions that are relevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that species.

HACCP controls such as critical control points, critical limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Example 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
One page from the ``Process-related Hazards and Controls List.'' For purposes of this Guide, process-related hazards
are those that can occur because of the nature of the processing procedures and the finished product form. This list
includes 20 types of finished products (e.g., cooked shrimp) and directs the reader to one or more of the 22 process-related
hazard and control descriptions, which are located in the next part of the Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process-related hazard and control descriptions are numbered. Some of them are further subdivided into lettered
portions. Where the reader need only refer to a portion of a process-related hazard and control description, the list
directs the reader to that portion by referring to a lettered part of the description. See below.

11'' (pathogen survival during pasteurization)). As with the species-related descriptions discussed above, each
process-related description explains a hazard and the measures available to control it, with an emphasis on HACCP
controls. Some of these descriptions are subdivided. For example, ``Process-related Hazard and Control No. 8,''
which is about temperature abuse, is subdivided into ``8a: Histamine,'' ``8b: Pathogens,'' and ``8c: Decomposition.''

II. Smoked Fishery Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Research conducted since FDA proposed the 1970 final rule shows that less stringent processing temperatures and
lower water-phase salt content, with or without use of other inhibiting factors such as sodium nitrite, can provide
an adequate margin of safety for hot-process products held in refrigerated storage (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower). FDA has considered this research, and based on it, the agency is proposing a guidance setting forth
what it tentatively finds are the minimum time, temperature, and salinity requirements to make a safe and marketable
smoked fish product. Proposed TTS parameters are found in example 6 of this appendix.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To minimize microbial growth, fresh fish should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained at refrigerated temperatures close to 38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (3.3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 173 and 175). Although certain strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are capable of growth at temperatures as low as 38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (3.3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favorable growth media are necessary for a significant growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate to occur at this temperature. For example, it has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Type E requires 31 to 35 days before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgrowth and toxin production occurs in a beef stew media held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. However, outgrowth and toxin production in a cooked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meat medium held at 41 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F does not occur until after 56 days, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating that less favorable growth media can significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower the rate of growth. Even in those cases where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does grow and produce toxin, the laboratory conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally more ideally suited to growth than those found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonexperimental situations where less favorable growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments prevail. Thus, while the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not completely inhibited at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), under the less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideal conditions for its growth that are generally encountered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of smoked fish, FDA has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining fresh fish at a maximum temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, only 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degrees above the temperature of complete growth inhibition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before and during processing will provide adequate protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
outgrowth. Moreover, 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the maximum temperature FDA has proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various guidelines, such as the Unicode (now called the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code) (53 FR 16472, May 9, 1988). Therefore, under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(14), all raw fish that is to be smoked must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated until needed for processing (Ref. 175). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, fish that are initially frozen need to remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the frozen state until needed for processing (Refs. 161 and 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When frozen fish are needed for processing, the thawing procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be carried out in a way that minimizes the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial growth (Refs. 161 and 171). The method used to thaw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish must provide an environment that will inhibit the growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and other microorganisms that pose a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health hazard (Refs. 171 and 172). Thus, the fish should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thawed in a way that ensures that the internal temperature at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
core of the fish does not exceed 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (Refs. 171 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
172). Therefore, section 4.a. of Example 6 of this appendix, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency suggests that this procedure be used in the thawing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spore outgrowth and toxin production in smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish relies on the interrelationship of processing time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing temperature, water-phase salt concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loin muscle, and smoke (or constituents of smoke) deposition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined with refrigerated storage (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower) (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.10(a)(14)) (Ref. 173). At one time, smoking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated brining may have been an effective preservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method. With the changes in processing techniques that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred since the advent of refrigeration and in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers' demands for products with certain organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualities, however, smoked fish products, either hot- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process, have become perishable products that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated and cannot be considered preserved foods (Ref. 173). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes that have occurred, both in processing techniques and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in organoleptic qualities, have resulted in products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more moist and contain less salt. As a result, the two critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing factors that affect the overall preservation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of the product have been altered. The processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-temperature parameters have been decreased, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content has been reduced (Ref. 173). Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products need to be maintained at refrigerated temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower) or frozen immediately after processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the overall quality of these products (Ref. 173). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Brining/dry salting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Salt, as a preservative in smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish, is somewhat limited in its effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the variability in salt uptake by fish flesh, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among fish in the same brining tank. Ventral muscle, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thin, absorbs high levels of salt, while the thicker dorsal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
muscles absorb less salt, limiting the effectiveness of salt as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterrent against spore outgrowth in that part of the fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equilibration techniques, such as two-stage brining, reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variation in salt content within a fish and increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservative effect (Ref. 176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that salt-tolerant microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern (such as strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) may grow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during brining or after the dry salting process. Therefore, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is providing in section 5.c. and 5.e. in example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix that the brining and dry salting of fish be carried out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at refrigerated temperatures, i.e., 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Doing so will ensure that the environment in which brining is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done, and in which fish are held after dry-salting, will inhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growth of salt-tolerant microorganisms that can cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential health hazard (Ref. 173). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that when fish are initially added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brine, the temperature of the brine may increase. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential to this process that the brine be returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated temperatures 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity of microbial growth and to ensure the overall quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product during the brining process (Refs. 175 and 182). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is suggesting in section 5.d. of Example 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this appendix that the temperature of the brine not exceed 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (16 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) at the start of brining.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To minimize the variation in salt content of the fish, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is recommending in section 5.f. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix that only fish of the same species and of similar size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and similar weight be brined in the same tank (Refs. 171 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
199). Because reuse of brine solutions is a possible route of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial contamination of raw fish, the agency is providing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5.g. of Example 6 of this appendix that brines not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reused unless they have been processed in some way to return them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a microbiological quality equivalent to the original, unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brine made with potable water and food-grade salt. The agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also providing in section 5.h. of Example 6 of this appendix that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a processor may rinse the brined fish with fresh water to remove

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Drying. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fish that are to be processed as smoked or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish are dried after brining to remove excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water and prevent dripping during smoking. The drying process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually of several hours in duration, provides another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for microbial growth. Therefore, to minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for microbial growth by reducing those conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would provide a favorable environment for such growth, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is providing in section 5.i. of Example 6 of this appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the presmoking drying step should be conducted in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated room (Ref. 46). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Smoking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Smoke deposition, like water-phase salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content, is very difficult to control. Constituents of smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called ``inhibitory compounds'' (such as phenolic compounds) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported to have a bactericidal effect (Ref. 177). Factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the quantity of inhibitory compounds deposited on the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface and the degree of penetration by those compounds into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are the humidity in the smoking chamber, the temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking, and the air flow in the smoking chamber (Ref. 178). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreased levels of inhibitory compounds reduce the preservative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of the smoke and make dependence on these compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvisable (Ref. 178). In general, smoked products are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shelf stable and must be either refrigerated at a temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower or frozen immediately after processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 43, 45, and 178). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To promote uniform deposition of smoke, heat exposure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dehydration, and to ensure that on completion of these processes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish do not contain any raw or wet sections that would create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an environment favorable for microbial growth and spoilage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is providing in section 5.j. of Example 6 of this appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that fish should be arranged in the smokehouse chamber or oven so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they are not overcrowded or touching each other, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only fish of like size and weight should be included in a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batch of fish for smoking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquid smoke, a solution of wood smoke that, when diluted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used to impart a smoke flavor to fish products, is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as an alternative to generated smoke. Liquid smoke has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported to have similar antibacterial properties to, and some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages over, generated smoke (Ref. 26). It is easier to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply uniformly, and the inhibitory compounds penetrate further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the fish flesh (Ref. 26). Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a combination of liquid smoke and generated smoke needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to all surfaces of fish to be smoked. Liquid smoke may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applied to the product before, at the commencement of, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the process, while generated smoke needs to be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish during the first half of the process and longer if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary (Refs. 178 and 179). If a combination of liquid smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and generated smoke is used, the method for use of liquid smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be followed, and the generated smoke may be applied at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of the process (Ref. 26). The agency is providing for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of liquid smoke alone or in combination with generated smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 3.c.2. of Example 6 of this appendix to impart smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor and antibacterial properties to the products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of sodium nitrite.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use of sodium nitrite in smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish products is limited to the species listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;172.175 (21 CFR 172.175) and to chubs in &sect;172.177 (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
172.177). Section 172.175 permits the use of sodium nitrite as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservative and color fixative in cured, smoked sablefish, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon, and shad. However, it requires that the level of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite in the final product not exceed 200 ppm. Use of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite substantially reduces the level of salt necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhibit outgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type A and type E spores, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the levels vary because of the difference in heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance between the two types of spores (Ref. 179). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of sodium nitrite necessary to achieve inhibition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by both the level of contamination and the resistance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spores (Refs. 179 and 180). Refrigeration of the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product at temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain the inhibitory characteristic gained through use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium nitrite (Ref. 179). Therefore, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177, the agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the use of sodium nitrite in the processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging of smoked and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a. and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Vacuum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging and other types of modified atmosphere-packaging (those in which the air in the package or container is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced by one or more gases, in various concentrations, before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the package is sealed) extend the shelf life of foods markedly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the anaerobic environment created in these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging favors the outgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
spores and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent toxin production, and it inhibits growth of aerobic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms that might otherwise serve as organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators of spoilage (Refs. 180 and 182). Consequently, use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging demands strict adherence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to temperature-controlled storage and distribution to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for spore outgrowth and toxin production and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the potential growth of other microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health significance (such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two methods of reducing the potential public health hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged smoked, smoke-flavored, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and salted fish products are: (1) To store and distribute the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products frozen or, alternatively, (2) to use in-package heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing followed by refrigeration. At freezer temperatures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgrowth of spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
types B, E, and F is retarded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 171, 173, and 180). Type A does not grow below 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (Refs. 179 and 180). Storage and distribution in the frozen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state reduces the possibility that temperature abuse will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In-package heat processing, sometimes referred to as ``heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization,'' at temperatures in the range of 185 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (85 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 85 minutes to 198 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (92 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 55 minutes, inhibits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgrowth and toxin production by type E spores (Ref. 185). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Longer exposure to processing temperatures is required for more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat resistant spores, such as types B and A (Ref. 185). In a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study examining this method of packaging, samples of hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon steaks were injected with spores of nonproteolytic strains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
types B and E (Ref. 185). The steaks were vacuum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaged, heat pasteurized, then incubated using different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-temperature combinations. The results of this research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that closely controlled in-package heat processing extends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shelf life of the product, inactivates nonproteolytic

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains product quality attributes. However, this process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more suitable for pieces, fillets, and steaks than for whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eviscerated fish because this process causes the flesh to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate from the backbone (Ref. 185). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Specific Processing Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The various processing techniques used to produce smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish are affected by the interrelationship of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking, the method of smoke application, the time-temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combinations used, and the water-phase salt content. A critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor in determining alternative processing methods is the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of packaging utilized, specifically whether the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air-packaged or vacuum-packaged. The following discussion sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out the various processing procedures that the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concluded will ensure the safety of hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoked and smoke-flavored fish, and cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air-packaged. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Research data and industry practice show that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower minimum water-phase salt content (3.5 percent or lower), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination with lower processing temperatures (lower than 180 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(82 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C)) than cited in the 1970 final rule for hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth and toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production when the products are not vacuum-packaged and are held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at refrigerated temperatures (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower) (Refs. 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
163, and 177). Research studies from the National Marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fisheries Service and testimony presented at a public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on May 3, 1989, to establish a CGMP for the manufacture of smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish products, show that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type E 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is inhibited in air-packaged smoked fish products when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content is at least 3.0 percent, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing internal temperature of the product is maintained at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum of 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for at least 30 minutes (Ref. 180). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light of these findings, FDA is setting forth these processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters in Example 6 of this appendix to provide guidance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safe manufacturing of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is setting forth the following minimum T-T-S 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for air-packed, hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish in section 5.a.1. of Example 6 of this appendix: Heating at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an internal temperature of 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum-packaged products, National Marine Fisheries Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research shows that processing temperatures in the range of 145 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 175
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (63 to 80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for hot-process smoked fish will inhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E when the water-phase salt content is greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 3.5 percent (Refs. 26, 173, and 180). Based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence, New York's CGMP included a procedure for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum-packaged smoked fish that specifies heating the fish to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 30 minutes, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of 3.5 percent (Ref. 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of sodium nitrite in combination with sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride significantly inhibits the outgrowth and toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type E. Research data show that when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water-phase salt content and sodium nitrite content are at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 3.1 percent and 100 ppm, respectively, and the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the fish is not less than 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, the inhibitory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
growth and toxin production greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases (Refs. 173 and 179). At higher processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures, e.g., 180 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (82 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), a water-phase salt content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.0 percent or more inhibits toxin formation by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E (Ref. 163). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this information, the agency is setting forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following T-T-S parameters for vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix: (1) Heating at an internal temperature of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 30 minutes with a minimum water-phase salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of 3.5 percent in the finished product, or (2) heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an internal temperature of at least 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes, with a minimum water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a sodium nitrite content of 100 to 200 ppm (as permitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food additive regulations in &sect;172.175) in the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency points out that these processing parameters for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimums. Unless the comments on Example 6 of this appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convince the agency otherwise, fish that have been processed at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower temperature or with a lower water-phase salt level could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the basis for regulatory action on the grounds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product has been processed under conditions whereby it may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reduced injurious to health and thus could represent a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard for consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish, by virtue of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures used in processing, are not cooked because they are

spores, and because they provide a favorable environment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other food spoilage microorganisms, other inhibitive factors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as higher salt content and sodium nitrite (where permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by food additive regulations in &sect;172.175) need to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time and temperature relationship in the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-smoked and smoke-flavored fish is a critical factor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yielding a microbiologically safe and high quality finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product (Ref. 182). Modern establishments that cold-smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally process between 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) and 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 24 hours (Refs. 171 and 182). Based on the research data that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are available and the requirements in the New York CGMP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing the following requirements for air-packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Air-packaged products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is providing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5.a.3. of Example 6 of this appendix that air-packed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should have a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of: (1) 3.5 percent, or (2) 3.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product, or (3) 2.5 percent in the finished product if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product is frozen immediately after processing and cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is kept frozen throughout holding and distribution. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is providing that the finished product that contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of 2.5 percent should be frozen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately and kept frozen to ensure the microbiological safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product, as well as to maintain the shelf-life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, because these products are not cooked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain a low water-phase salt content, these products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present a potential public health hazard because they provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideal environment for the outgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
spores and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin production. Therefore, based on the discussion above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is suggesting that air-packaged cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish be processed under one of the following sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of conditions: (1) A maximum 20-hour drying and smoking period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(32 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 5.a.3.i. of Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a maximum 24-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the smoking chamber not exceeding 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this appendix) except that sablefish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs to be heated to a temperature not to exceed 120 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (49 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a period not to exceed 6 hours (section 5.a.3.iii. of example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6 of this appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of this appendix that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish to be vacuum- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified atmosphere-packaged should have a minimum water-phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt content of: (1) 3.0 percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium nitrite in the finished product, or (2) 3.5 percent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the finished product when no sodium nitrite is used. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also providing that vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should be processed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under one of the following sets of conditions: (1) A maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking chamber not exceeding 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (32 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 5.a.3.i. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) a maximum 24-hour drying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency again points out that these processing parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish are minimums. Failure to adhere to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters could provide the basis for regulatory action because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product that results may be injurious to health and thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could represent a hazard to consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that the proposed processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air-packed and vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a safe and commercially acceptable product. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because less data and information are available for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products than for hot-process products, the agency is requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific comments, data, and information about these processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters and any alternative processing parameters that should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in the guideline.

 Rapid cooling

and storage at temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4

&cir;C) or below are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential for all smoked, smoke-flavored, and salted fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to minimize microbial growth. The exceptions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process air-packaged products that contain a water-phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt content of 2.5 percent, which should be frozen immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after processing and remain frozen throughout distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the lower water-phase salt content and lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing temperatures that may provide an opportunity for food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spoilage microorganisms to flourish during storage (see section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At section 6 of Example 6 of the appendix, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending specific time/temperature controls for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after smoking. These proposed controls are the same as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for after cooking in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document (Appendix A, section 6). A full discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls is provided in section VII.J.3. of this document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative processing parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As this preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates, FDA has tentatively concluded that the TTS processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters reflected in this appendix are the minimum necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that these products are free from botulinum toxin over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their shelf life. FDA has also tentatively concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T-T-S parameters, coupled with good sanitation practices, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also render these products listeria free. Nonetheless, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency does not wish to discourage the development and use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative procedures that are capable of achieving the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, section 11 of Example 6 of this appendix calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the use of alternative processing parameters when the user 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can demonstrate the following: (1) For botulism, zero toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production slightly beyond the expected shelf life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, demonstrated through inoculated pack studies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal and moderate abuse conditions and (2) for listeria, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detectable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the final product. The data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating these outcomes would have to be available to FDA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the agency to determine whether they have been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 6 of this appendix states that those data should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of a processor's HACCP records. FDA asks for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a third-party scientific expert, or processing authority, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be involved in the development of the data that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate the effectiveness of the alternative procedure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained above, vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged smoked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored, and salted fish products represent an increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health hazard over conventionally packaged products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these types of packaging provide the ideal environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for spore outgrowth and toxin production. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion above, the agency states in section 3 of Example 6 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this appendix that these types of packaging should be used only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when: (1) As provided in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix the product is a hot-process smoked or smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere-packed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the finished product (section 4.a.1. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix); (2) as provided in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this appendix, the product is a cold-process smoked or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packed, and contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is providing in Appendix C, section 8.a. that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging should be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the processing plant where the product is manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 180). FDA considers this limitation appropriate to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any postprocessing contamination of the product from bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens and to ensure that the fish will be packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately after processing to protect its overall quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Process monitoring.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 7 of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix, the agency is recommending specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature indicating and recording devices where they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended elsewhere in this appendix. These proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications are the same as those proposed in Appendix A for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products (Appendix A, section 7). A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full discussion of these controls is provided in section VII.J.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the preamble to this document. Temperature indicating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording devices are specifically recommended in section 5.j. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 5.k. of Example 6 of this appendix for the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending specific controls to ensure that the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt and sodium nitrate levels are achieved. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance of these attributes has already been discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document. In section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency recommends that a processor perform or obtain a study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that shows that under certain processing conditions the desired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water phase salt or sodium nitrite level will reliably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved. The processor should monitor those processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions identified by the study as having an impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the product to achieve the desired level. The study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should provide critical limits for each of the relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing conditions (e.g. maximum fish size, minimum soak time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum salt to product ratio). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the existence of numerous variables that affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of fish to uniformly take up salt and sodium nitrite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it may be appropriate for a processor to perform periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product water phase salt or sodium nitrite analyses as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification step. The purpose of such analyses would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify any variables that have an impact on salt or nitrite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorption that were not identified by the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrective actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 At section 9 of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix, the agency is recommending corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. These proposed procedures are the same as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix A, section 8). A full discussion of the procedures is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in section VII.J.5 of the preamble to this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sanitary zones.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 At section 10 of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix, the agency is recommending the institution of sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zones. This proposed control procedure is the same as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix A, section 9). A full discussion of the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure is provided in section VII.J.6 of the preamble to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further ensure the safety of the product during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution and storage, FDA is considering adopting specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
package labeling requirements for smoked and smoke-flavored fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to reduce the opportunity of temperature abuse of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product. The agency requests comments on whether it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should require that the label of all shipping containers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail packages state that the product is perishable, and, more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically, that the product must be kept refrigerated. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively finds that such labeling is extremely important to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring the safe handling of these products, and, therefore, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers it likely that it will require this labeling in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule. The agency requests comment on whether it should do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so. The agency also requests comment on whether, if it decides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require such a label statement, the statement should specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature at which the product should be refrigerated (e.g. 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below). The agency is also considering requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the label of all frozen smoked products state that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product must remain frozen, that if the product needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thawed, it must be thawed at refrigerated temperatures, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product must not be refrozen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has authority to adopt these labeling requirements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 201(n), 403(a), and 701(a) of the act because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections require the inclusion of facts on the food label that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are material with respect to consequences that may result from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the product under conditions of use prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label or that are otherwise customary or usual. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether it is necessary to do so.

Hazard Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fish and molluscan shellfish may be harvested from waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are exposed to varying amounts of environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants. Industrial chemicals, pesticides, and many toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements may accumulate in fish at levels that can cause public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health problems. Concern for these contaminants primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focuses on fish and shellfish harvested from fresh water, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estuaries, and near-coastal waters rather than from the open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ocean. Pesticides and herbicides used near aquaculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations or for other purposes may contaminate fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal tolerances or action levels are established for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the most toxic and persistent contaminants that are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products shipped in interstate commerce. (These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants and their corresponding limits are listed below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When products exceed these limits, FDA can seize the contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States often use the limits for deciding whether to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption advisories or to close or classify waters for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting. Molluscan shellfish waters are controlled by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Shellfish Control Agency (SSCA) or the equivalent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign countries that have Memoranda of Understanding with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States that permit them to export molluscan shellfish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this country. If local or regional contaminants are not covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by federal limits, contact local health departments to decide if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant levels in fish and fishery products are of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control measures provided in this section are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for the control of methyl mercury contamination in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish, where such contamination is the result of industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination in a harvest area. Recommended controls for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem of open ocean species, such as swordfish and shark, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrating methyl mercury from their diet and its diffuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence in the environment are provided in the ``Mercury'' hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section.

Critical Control Point: Receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are five options for control at this critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the firm receives wild caught fish, other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish, directly from the fisher or from a supplier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tender or related company that pools fish from various fishers), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following applies:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the fisher upon receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Find out whether the harvest area is closed to fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by foreign, Federal, State or local health authorities due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known instances of chemical contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Reject fish that have been caught in a closed area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ABC Fish Co. has contacted the State Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health and learned that the Long River is closed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial harvest above Lookout Point, including its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tributaries, due to the presence of chlordecone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Kepone
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). The species affected are croaker, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bluefish, and striped bass. ABC Fish Co., which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes these species, will reject any of the listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species originating from the area.

Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A record for each lot or batch that shows the harvest area for the fish. Record may be the receipt from the fisher, if it
shows the harvest area, or it may be a notation on another record of the location of harvest for each lot or batch. The
description of the location should be clear enough to show that the fish were harvested from an area that is open to harvesting.
Longitude and latitude may be necessary (e.g., for open ocean harvesting).

Option 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the firm receives raw fish, other than molluscan shellfish, directly from the aquacultural or maricultural
producer or from a supplier that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a tender or related company
that pools fish from various aquaculturists), the following applies:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch of aquacultured fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Find out the potential for chemical contamination before receipt of the product. This can be done by obtaining or
reviewing the results of analysis of soil, water, and raw fish samples, as needed. Monitor agricultural and industrial
practices in the aquacultural or maricultural production area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Reject fish that have been grown in an area where uses of agricultural or industrial chemicals are likely to have
caused contamination of the growing and harvesting environment or where soil, water, or fish sample results show
chemical contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Example
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ABC Fish Co., which receives pond-raised catfish from the Long River delta area, screens potential pond sites either
directly or by obtaining results of the aquaculturists' analyses of soil and water samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The samples are analyzed for pesticides, PCB's, dioxins, and petrochemicals. Either ABC Fish Co. representatives
visit each pond to assess the potential for ongoing chemical contamination, or information is obtained from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Extension Service about the use of pesticides and herbicides near each pond. Where there
is a potential for pond contamination, annual samples are collected and analyzed for the same contaminants. Fish
that come from contaminated or suspect ponds are rejected.

Option 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the firm receives fish, other than molluscan shellfish, from someone other than the fisher, aquacultural producer,
or a supplier that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a transportation company that pools
fish from various fishers or aquaculturists), the following applies:

Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Periodically monitor the incoming fish for environmentally persistent organochlorine pesticides which have
the potential to be present in the fish. These should include, but are not limited to: DDT and its degradation products
(DDE, TDE), chlordane, and heptachlor, also similar chlorinated industrial chemicals, such as PCB's and dioxins.
Sampling should represent all suppliers (i.e., three samples per supplier per year).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Reject all shipments from suppliers that provide fish that exceed the critical limits unless convincing evidence
can be obtained that only acceptable harvest or growing areas are now being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Example
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
ABC Fish Co. receives brown shrimp from an interstate seafood transportation company. The carrier, which buys the
shrimp directly from the fishers, makes no effort to learn the harvest location. ABC Fish Co. collects three samples
per supplier per year and sends them to a contract laboratory for pesticide screening. When positive test results
are obtained, the firm stops using that supplier.

1. Find out the harvest area location from the harvester's tag on the containers of shellfish for each lot or batch of
shellfish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Check the harvester's state commercial fishing license or compare the dealer's certification number to those
listed in the most current edition of the ``Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List (ICSSL).'' If the dealer
is not listed, check for certification with the SSCA or equivalent.

and certification number of the last processor. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is compared to the ICSSL to confirm that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product is from a certified processor. Containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process is a food safety hazard for cooked, ready-to-eat products packed in hermetically sealed
containers and held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated. Pasteurization is a process applied to a fish or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery product after that fish or fishery product has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in a final, hermetically sealed package. The process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves the application of sufficient heat (or other processes) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a sufficient time to cause the reduction of microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern to levels that, under normal conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, are unlikely to cause disease. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

a pathogenic microorganism that may be found in fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Botulism is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum. C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E can grow and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce toxin at temperatures as low as 3.3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F), and must, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, be eliminated from the hermetically sealed container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the pasteurization process. Pasteurized products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored, distributed, and displayed in the frozen state, and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so labeled, are not similarly at risk, and need not be subjected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the constraints of these control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For there to be assurance that the pasteurization step 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively eliminates the microorganisms of public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E), a minimum acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process should be scientifically established. This requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expert knowledge of thermal process calculations. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in establishing the minimum thermal process should be those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are generally recognized and accepted. Sometimes, thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death time, heat penetration, and inoculated pack studies will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to establish the minimum process. In other instances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing literature is sufficient to provide the processor with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In either case, characteristics of the process and/or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product will necessarily affect the ability of the cook step to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively eliminate the microorganisms of public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance. Such factors should be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of the process. Where control of those factors is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to consistently achieve that goal, the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority should specify these to the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is necessary that the pasteurizing equipment be designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and operated so that every unit of product receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established minimum process. This will require that a competent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority, who is thoroughly familiar with the dynamics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of heat transfer in processing equipment, evaluate the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the type of equipment used by the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sometimes temperature distribution studies will be necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing literature will be sufficient to establish the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the equipment.

Critical Control Point: Pasteurization Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Make sure that the pasteurization process that is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used was designed to ensure an appropriate reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers of viable microorganisms of public health concern. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the pasteurization process should be established by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority. The pasteurization process that is being used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should meet any factors of the process or of the product that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified by the process authority as critical to achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogen destruction. At a minimum, these critical factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include pasteurizing times and temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Make sure that the pasteurization equipment being used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is properly designed and operated to deliver the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the process authority. The engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications of the equipment being used (e.g., pipe sizes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rates, loading pattern) should meet or exceed that of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment evaluated by a process authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Deliver the pasteurization process in a way that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no deviation from the minimum established pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Monitor the pasteurization temperature with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recording device (i.e., temperature recorder). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recorder should be installed where it can be easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read and the sensor for the device should be installed to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it accurately measures the coldest temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurizing equipment. The temperature recorder must show a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous record of the process. Computerized storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature data may be used for a temperature recorder chart if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be equivalent to the use of a temperature recorder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Check the accuracy of each temperature recorder at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning and end of each production day and adjust it as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to agree as nearly as possible with a temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating device (mercury-in-glass thermometer or equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device). The thermometer should be installed where it can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily read and placed to ensure that it accurately measures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coldest temperature of the pasteurizing equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Calibrate the thermometer at the pasteurizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature against an accurate standard thermometer. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be done when the thermometer is installed and at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once a year after that, or more frequently, if necessary, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure its accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Monitor the length of the pasteurization cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Monitor other critical factors (e.g., initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, container size, product formulation) at the start of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each shift or when the product changes during a shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The ABC Crab Co. produces pasteurized crabmeat. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process being used has been established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the university extension service (a process authority). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process provided by the extension service includes limits on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to stack the canned product into the pasteurizer, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process temperature, and the length of time needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve proper pasteurization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pasteurization equipment being used by ABC Crab Co. is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least equivalent to that described by the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from the extension service. It is equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a mercury-in-glass thermometer and a recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermometer. The recording thermometer is compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercury-in-glass thermometer during each pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle. It is adjusted as necessary to meet the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit. The mercury-in-glass thermometer is calibrated at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent laboratory every 6 months. The temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each pasteurization cycle is controlled to meet the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits using the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each cycle is controlled using a wall clock. The loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cans is checked before starting each batch.

temperature, time, or other critical factors of the process or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, within the critical limits, the affected product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;destroyed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;reprocessed to eliminate the hazard, keeping full

&bull;segregated and held until an evaluation can be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the effect of a deviation. The evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made by a process authority following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized procedures. Unless the evaluation shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the product has received adequate pasteurization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product should be destroyed or reprocessed to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides consolidated guidance on how to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance involves processing procedures for the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological hazards to which these products are particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible. The guidance does not apply to finnan haddie, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoked cod fillets, smoked scotch kippers, or other smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are cooked before being consumed, because these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be heated to destroy any potential toxins or pathogens. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance also does not apply to smoked fishery products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaged in hermetically sealed containers, processed to destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spores of nonproteolytic 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

types B, E, and F, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored and distributed refrigerated, in the same container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These products are covered by Appendix A relating to Cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ready-to-Eat fishery products. In addition, the guidance does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not cover environmental or other hazards that might occur before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor takes possession of its product or raw materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Products covered by this guidance should be subjected to one of the following processes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoke-flavored fish to be air packaged needs to be heated to a continuous internal
temperature of at least 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) throughout each fish for a minimum of 30 minutes, and brined to contain not less than 3.0 percent water-phase
salt in the finished product (except that smoked chub containing sodium nitrite as provided for in &sect;172.177
of this chapter must be processed as described in that section); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoked-flavored fish to be vacuum packaged, modified atmosphere packaged,
or controlled atmosphere packaged, needs to be heated to a continuous internal temperature of at least 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) throughout each fish for a minimum of 30 minutes. It also needs to be brined to contain not less than 3.5 percent
water-phase salt in the finished product. However, where sodium nitrite is present at not less than 100 parts per million
(as permitted by &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177 of this chapter) the water-phase salt content in the finished product
should not be less than 3.0 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cold-process smoked fish and cold-process smoke-flavored fish to be air-packaged should be brined or dry salted
to contain at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished product. However, when such fish contains not less
than 100 parts per million sodium nitrite, it should contain not less than 3.0 percent water-phase salt in the finished
product. When cold-process smoked fish or cold-process smoked-flavored fish to be air-packaged is frozen immediately
after smoking and cooling, and remains frozen throughout subsequent storage and distribution, it should contain
not less than 2.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished product. Cold smoked and cold smoke-flavored fish to be
air packaged should be processed under one of the following sets of conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The temperature in the smoking chamber does not exceed 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (32 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) during a drying and smoking period that does not exceed 20 hours, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The temperature in the smoking chamber does not exceed 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) during a drying and smoking period that does not exceed 24 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For sablefish, the temperature in the smoking chamber does not exceed 120 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (49 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) during a drying and smoking period that does not exceed 6 hours; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Cold-process smoked fish and cold-process smoke-flavored fish, to be vacuum packaged, modified atmosphere
packaged, or controlled atmosphere packaged should be brined to contain at least 3.0 percent water-phase salt in
the finished product and not less than 100 parts per million of sodium nitrite (where permitted by &sect;&sect;172.175
and 172.177 of this chapter) and should be processed as described in section 5(a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this Appendix.
If sodium nitrite is not used, the water-phase salt content in the finished product should be at least 3.5 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Brining and dry salting operations should be conducted in a manner that will consistently result in the water phase
salt content or sodium nitrite level (where permitted by &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177 of this chapter) recommended
by section 5.a. of this Appendix. This should be achieved by conducting or obtaining a study that establishes that
the appropriate salt content or sodium nitrite level is always met under prescribed processing conditions. The study
should establish the limits of significant variables that could affect the ability of the product to reach the appropriate
levels. These variables may include product size, product condition, soak time, soak temperature, salt-to-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water ratio, and product-to-brine ratio. An adequate study should consist of at least three processing runs under
the prescribed processing conditions. In this case, the processor should monitor and record the prescribed processing
conditions identified by the study at least every 2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The brining of all fish should take place in a refrigerated area at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The temperature of the brine should not exceed 60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (15.6 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) at the start of brining. The temperature of the brine at the start of the each brining process should be determined
and recorded.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. For dry salting, the fish should be returned to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated area of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower immediately after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application of the salt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Different species of fish and fish of dissimilar size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and weight should not be mixed in the same brining tank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Brines should not be reused unless they are subject to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that effectively returns them to a microbiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition equivalent to the original, unused brine made with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potable water and food-grade salt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Fish may be rinsed with potable water after brining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Drying of a product to be cold-smoked should be carried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out in a refrigerated area at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Smoking operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fish should be arranged without overcrowding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without touching each other within the smokehouse oven or chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to permit uniform smoke absorption, heat exposure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dehydration. Fish smoked in the same smoke chamber load should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be of relatively uniform size and weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid smoke and generated smoke needs to be applied to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces of the product. Liquid smoke may be applied to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product before, at the beginning, or during the process. If only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated smoke is to be used, it needs to be applied to the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the first half of the process. If a combination of liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke and generated smoke is used, the generated smoke may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied at any stage of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Each smoking chamber should be equipped with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recording device to indicate the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air and of the fish within the smoking chamber. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each chamber should be equipped with a temperature indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device to indicate the temperature of the air within the smoking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. During hot-smoking or cold-smoking, a temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording device should be used to monitor both the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the fish and the ambient temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking chamber. The internal temperature readings should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained by inserting probes from the temperature recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device into the thickest flesh portion of three or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest fish in the smoking chamber. The temperature from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slowest heating fish should be considered the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Cooling after smoking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After smoking, the product needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be rapidly cooled to minimize recontamination. Continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling from 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to achieve an internal temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below within 2 hours and an internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below within an additional 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, unless processing after smoking as described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.b. of this Appendix, occurs during either of these time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods, will effectively minimize recontamination. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature parameters may also be effective. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should ensure that the cooling parameters are met by either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Conducting or obtaining a study that establishes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate cooling temperatures are always met under prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing conditions. The study should establish the limits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant variables that could affect the rate of cooling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These variables may include product size, ambient air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, and amount of product in the cooler. An adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study should consist of at least three processing runs under the prescribed processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Monitoring and recording the prescribed processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions as identified by the study in section 6.a.2.i. of this

Appendix at least every 2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Processing after smoking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Products that will receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing after smoking should not be exposed to ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for longer than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative total of 4 hours after smoking. If they are exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to such temperatures for more than 4 hours, unacceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recontamination is the likely result. Processors are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly monitor and record the length of time that the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is exposed to temperatures above 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) under 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123.8. FDA recommends that such monitoring and recording be done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least every 2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Final product cooling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To avoid microbiological hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for perishable finished products, the internal temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product should be 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below within 4 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of placement in a finished product container. Processors should

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Where reference is made in this Appendix to temperature-indicating devices and temperature-recording devices,
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following conditions should apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Temperature-indicating devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Temperature-indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices should be installed where they can be easily read and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located to ensure that they accurately measure the warmest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the refrigeration equipment and the coldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the smoking equipment, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temperature-indicating devices should be calibrated at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine operating temperature of the refrigeration, cooling, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking equipment against a known accurate standard thermometer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon installation and at least once a year thereafter, or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently, if necessary, to ensure their accuracy. Records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy checks for temperature-indicating devices required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained under 21 CFR 123.8 should specify the date, standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, method used, results, and person performing the test. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device that has a divided fluid column or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that cannot be adjusted to the standard should be immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired or replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Temperature-recording devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Temperature-recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices should be installed where they can be easily read and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensors for such devices should be installed to ensure that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately measure the warmest temperature of the refrigeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and the coldest temperature of the smoking equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate. Computerized storage of temperature data may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in place of recorder thermometer charts if the use of such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system has been validated and can be shown to be substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to the use of a temperature-recording device. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device should be checked for accuracy at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beginning and end of each production day and adjusted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to agree as nearly as possible with the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device. A record of these accuracy checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be maintained that specifies the time, date, temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by both devices before adjustment, corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken, where applicable, and person performing the accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted only within the facilities in which the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Permanently legible code marks should be placed on each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product package and shipping container. These marks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should identify the plant where the product was packed and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of packing.

9. Corrective Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 21 CFR 123.7, whenever a deviation occurs at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control point, the processor is required to segregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hold the product until a review can be made to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of that deviation and take corrective action as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products, when a deviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs at a brining or smoking critical control point, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor should meet the requirements of &sect;123.7 either by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroying the product; by fully reprocessing, where possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the production involved, keeping full records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reprocessing conditions; or by setting aside that portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product involved for further evaluation as to any potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health significance. Such an evaluation should be made by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a process authority and should be in accordance with procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized by process authorities as being adequate to detect any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable hazard to public health. Unless this evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that the product had been rendered safe for its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended use, the product set aside should be either fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reprocessed to correct the deficiency or destroyed. A record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made of the evaluation procedures used and the results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Either upon completion of full reprocessing or after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that no significant public health hazard exists, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the product involved may be shipped in normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the product involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be destroyed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 123.10, sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zones should be established around areas in which a smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is handled or stored. In such areas, objects and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees that have come into contact with waste, raw product, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other insanitary objects are excluded. Packaging material, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, employees, and in-process materials that enter a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitary zone should be treated in a manner that will minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of the introduction of microorganisms. Air handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems should be designed to minimize the risk of airborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination into sanitary zones and to provide positive air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure in the sanitary zone relative to the surrounding areas.

A processor of smoked or smoke-flavored fishery products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use parameters other than those provided in Appendix C, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.a., if those parameters will achieve the following, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by adequate scientific studies: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For botulism, zero toxin production in the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a time period slightly beyond the shelf life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, demonstrated through inoculated pack studies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal and moderate abuse conditions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For listeria, no detectable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria monocytogenes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final product. A processor using alternative parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have on file, subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123.8(d), a description, including the results of, the scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies.
