 This interim final rule authorizes expenses and establishes assessment rates for the Florida Lime Administrative
Committee and the Avocado Administrative Committee (Committees) under Marketing Orders 911 and 915 for the 1994&hyph;95
fiscal year. The Committees are responsible for local administration of the marketing orders which regulate the
handling of Florida limes and avocados. Authorization of these budgets enables the Committees to incur expenses
that are reasonable and necessary to administer their respective programs. Funds to administer these programs are
derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 911 [7 CFR part 911], as amended, regulating
the handling of limes grown in Florida; and Marketing Agreement and Order No. 915 [7 CFR part 915] regulating the handling
of avocados grown in Florida. These agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, limes and avocados grown in Florida are subject to assessments. It is intended that
the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable Florida limes and avocados handled during
the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, beginning April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 45 handlers of limes grown in Florida, and approximately 40 producers in the regulated area
who are subject to regulation under the lime marketing order. Also, there are approximately 65 handlers of avocados
grown in Florida, and approximately 95 producers in the regulated area who are subject to regulation under the avocado
marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of lime and avocado producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lime and avocado marketing orders, administered by the Department, require that the assessment rates for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable limes and avocados handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses
are prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible for local administration of their respective marketing
orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. Each Committee consists of producers, handlers and a non-industry
public member. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel
in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The Committees' budgets are formulated
and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide
input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rates recommended by the Committees are derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of limes and avocados (in bushels). Because those rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established
at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. The recommended budgets
and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred
on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committees
will have funds to pay their expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Lime Administrative Committee met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing
order expenditures of $89,697 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 55-pound bushel of limes. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94
marketing year budgeted expenditures were $113,846, which is $24,149 more than the $89,697 recommended for this
fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.16 per bushel remains the same as last year's assessment rate of $0.16. The major
budget categories for 1994&hyph;95 are $28,000 for administrative staff salaries and $10,100 for employee benefits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $64,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 400,000 55-pound bushels of limes. Interest on savings is expected to add an additional $2,000 to income. The assessment
and interest income will have to be augmented by $23,697 from the Committee's reserves to provide adequate funds to
cover budgeted expenses. Sufficient reserve funds are available to cover the projected deficit. Funds in the reserve
at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $250,000. These reserve funds will be within the maximum
permitted by the order of three fiscal years' expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Avocado Administrative Committee also met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing
order expenditures of $97,000 and an assessment rate of $0.16 per 55-pound bushel of avocados. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 marketing year budgeted expenditures were $113,846, which is $16,846 more than the
$97,000 recommended for this fiscal year. The assessment rate of $0.16 per bushel remains the same as last year's assessment
rate of $0.16. The major budget categories for 1994&hyph;95 are $28,000 for administrative staff salaries, $15,600
for compliance, and $10,100 for employee benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $96,000 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 600,000 55-pound bushels of avocados. Interest on savings is expected to add an additional $1,000 to income. Sufficient
reserve funds are available to cover any unexpected shortfall in projected income. Funds in the reserve at the end
of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $100,000. These reserve funds will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of three fiscal years' expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committees' recommendations, and other
available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause

 because: (1) The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year begins on April 1, 1994, and the marketing orders require that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable limes and avocados handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware
of this action which was recommended by the Committees at public meetings; and (4) this interim final rule provides
a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes.
This action requires inspections of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes;
inspections of certain MLG bushings; installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect; inspection and
modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel; repair or replacement of discrepant parts; and revision
of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), as necessary. This amendment is prompted by numerous reports of brake failure
during landing and during a low energy rejected takeoff. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure
of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FAA has received reports from Boeing that certain Model 767 series airplanes, equipped with carbon brakes, have
experienced vibratory conditions, which resulted in damage or failure of the brake torque rod cross bolts and pins.
Recently, one operator experienced a two-brake failure on a low energy rejected takeoff, whereas previously, there
had been reports of two-brake failures occurring only during landings. To date, there have been 13 reported incidents
of one-brake failure and 5 incidents of a two-brake failure, all due to the vibratory phenomenon. This type of failure
could result in the loss of one or two brakes (out of eight total brakes), depending upon the location of the failure.
The possibility exists that more than one brake-couple pair could experience simultaneous failure of the cross bolts
or pins, which could result in the loss of more than two brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Boeing has advised the FAA that heat damage resulting from high vibrational loads could lead to fracture of the brake
rod inner cylinder bolts. If this should occur, the adjacent brake rods would disconnect from the inner cylinder,
causing the brakes not to operate at two MLG wheels. As a result, secondary damage to the hydraulic lines and damage
to wiring and the airframe could occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing has also advised the FAA that vibrations during braking can lead to separation of the brake disconnect. Separation
of brake hoses from the brakes would increase braking distances, which is of greatest concern if this should happen
during a rejected takeoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Boeing has advised the FAA that the development of a fracture in a cross bolt in the brake rod pin assembly
could cause the brake not to operate at that MLG wheel. The brake rod could separate from the brake housing, permitting
the brake housing to turn on the axle. Under such conditions, while the wheel turns and brake pressure is applied, rotation
of the brake housing would cut the hydraulic line and electrical wires attached to the brake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions, if not corrected, could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0116, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994,
that describes procedures for repetitive surface temper etch inspections and fluorescent magnetic particle inspections
to detect cracks or thermal damage of the existing brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the MLG wheels and brakes, and replacement
of cracked or damaged bolts with new or serviceable bolts. The service bulletin also describes procedures for performing
repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings, and the brake rod bushings
at the inner cylinder fork lug end, and repair of cracked bushings. Accomplishment of the repetitive inspections,
and replacement or repair as necessary, will help prevent the possibility of a fracture developing in the brake rod
inner cylinder bolts. (The service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon
brakes.)

The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0125, dated November 11, 1993,
that describes procedures for installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect. The alert service bulletin
also describes procedures for adjustment of the torque of the ``B''-nut on the hydraulic line connection to the disconnect
fitting. Accomplishment of the installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect will provide an improved
installation of the brake disconnect, which keeps the brake hose connected to the brake. (The alert service bulletin
limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes, line positions 132 through 518,
inclusive.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994,
that describes procedures for performing a visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel to detect
cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion, chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; replacement of any
damaged brake rod pin assembly; modification of the brake rod pin assembly; installation of the modified brake rod
pin into the brake housing and brake rod; and installation of a new brake attach pin retainer configuration. The service
bulletin also describes a visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or missing pieces of material
in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod; and repair or replacement as necessary. Accomplishment
of this inspection and modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel, inspection of certain MLG bushings,
and replacement or repair as necessary, will help prevent the possibility of a fracture developing in a cross bolt.
The manufacturer has installed this modification on airplanes (equipped with carbon brakes) in production, starting
at line number 519 and subsequent. (The service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped
with carbon brakes, line positions 132 through 518, inclusive.)

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model 767 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect
the stopping performance of the airplane. This AD requires the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

thermal damage of the existing brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the MLG wheels and brakes, and replacement of cracked
or damaged bolts with new or serviceable bolts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings and the brake rod bushings
at the inner cylinder fork lug end; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect and adjustment of the torque of the ``B''-nut on the
hydraulic line connection to the disconnect fitting; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A one-time visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel to detect cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion,
chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; replacement of any damaged brake rod pin assembly with a
new or serviceable assembly; modification of the brake rod pin assembly; installation of the modified brake rod pin
into the brake housing and brake rod; and installation of a new brake attach pin retainer configuration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A one-time visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or missing pieces in the bushings in the brake
housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Subsequent repair or replacement of any cracked and/or deformed bushings, and/or any bushings having missing
pieces of material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This AD allows operation with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked or broken bushings, for
operators who comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD within the acceptable compliance
timeframe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD allows operation with two-brake-deactivated performance decrements, for operators who have not accomplished
the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD within the acceptable compliance timeframe. For those
operators, this AD requires revising the Limitations and Flight Performance Sections of the Airplane Flight Manual
(AFM) to include two-brake-deactivated performance decrements. Three options are provided: the first and second
options are simple, conservative corrections; the third option, while more complicated, can provide a less penalizing
correction, depending upon the conditions. The effect of this AD is to ensure that flight crews are advised of the potential
hazard and of the procedures to address it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicability of this AD is limited to only Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382, 382B,
382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners
in the upper truss mounts of certain engines, inspections to detect cracking in the associated tangs, and replacement
of damaged parts with new or serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of fatigue cracking of the upper
tang of the truss mounts. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent multiple failures of the upper truss
mounts due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking, which could adversely affect the integrity of the engine
mount structure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the operator of Lockheed Model C&hyph;130 (military) series airplanes reported that, during routine
maintenance inspections, the truss mounts on the upper tangs on the outboard engines of several airplanes were found
to be cracked. These airplanes had accumulated between 9,000 and 14,000 total hours time-in-service. Since these
military airplanes are typically subjected to more rigorous flight operations (such as low level penetration, air
drop, and soft landings during training missions) than their civilian aircraft counterparts, the fatigue life of
the components on these military airplanes are affected more adversely. These findings of cracking, which have been
attributed to fatigue, were found in the upper attach fittings between the engine truss mounts and the front wing spars.
This cracking occurred in the tangs that penetrate the front wing spars and progressed to the point of overload failure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar cracking was also found on a civilian Model 382G series airplane that had accumulated approximately 23,000
total hours time-in-service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Complete fracture of a single upper truss mount would not adversely affect the fail-safe structure of the airplane;
however, the effect on the fatigue life of the remaining upper truss mount is unknown at this time. Additional failures
of the upper truss mount, if not corrected, could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The engine mountings on the military Model C&hyph;130 and the civilian Model 382G series airplanes are identical
in design to the mountings on civilian Model 382, 382B, 382E, and 382F series airplanes on which the outer wings have
been replaced in accordance with Manufacturing End Product (MEP) 12R/13R or MEP 9T/10T. Although cracking has not
been found on these specific civilian airplanes, the FAA has determined that those airplanes could be subject to the
same type of fatigue cracking in the subject engine mounts that was found in the military airplanes and in the civilian
Model 382G series airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, although cracking has been detected only on the engine mounts of the number one engine, the FAA has determined
that fatigue could similarly stress the engine mountings of both outboard (number one and number four) engines, and
that consequent fatigue cracking is likely to occur on the mountings of both engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed Alert Service Bulletin A382&hyph;71&hyph;19&hyph;A82&hyph;687, dated
December 23, 1993, that describes procedures for inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners, and
cracking of the upper tangs of the truss mounts on the outboard engines.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Lockheed Model 382, 382B,
382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent multiple failures
of the upper truss mounts, which could adversely affect the integrity of the engine mount structure. This AD requires
repetitive general visual inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners on the inboard and outboard
upper truss mounts of the number one and number four (left and right outboard) engines, and repetitive general visual
inspections to detect cracking in the upper tangs of the truss mounts of these engines. The actions are required to
be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD also requires replacement of loose, missing, or deformed fasteners with new or serviceable fasteners, and
replacement of cracked truss mount upper tangs with new or serviceable tangs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions
is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking
action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;04&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

 on September 10, 1993. That final rule removed Boise, ID, from the description of J&hyph;54 to improve existing air
traffic control (ATC) route continuity on frequently used high altitude routes. However, during recent flight checks
of J&hyph;54, it was determined that Boise, ID, should be reinstated and the jet route segment from Cherokee, WY, to
Laramie, WY, should be removed due to lack of frequency protection in the extended service volume. This action reflects
the restoration of Boise, ID, and the removal of the jet route segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie, WY, in the description
of J&hyph;54.

On September 10, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that alters several jet routes
located in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, and Oregon to coincide with the scheduled
opening date of the new Denver International Airport (58 FR 47633). However, during recent flight checks of jet route
J&hyph;54, it was determined that Boise, ID, should be reinstated and the jet route segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie,
WY, should be removed due to lack of frequency protection in the extended service volume. This action reflects the
reinstatement of Boise, ID, and the removal of the segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie, WY, in the description of

This amendment adopts miscellaneous amendments to the required IFR (instrument flight rules) altitudes and changeover
points for certain Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes for which a minimum or maximum en route authorized
IFR altitude is prescribed. This regulatory action is needed because of changes occurring in the National Airspace
System. These changes are designed to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace under instrument
conditions in the affected areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to Part 95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 95) amends, suspends, or revokes IFR altitudes
governing the operation of all aircraft in flight over a specified route or any portion of that route, as well as the
changeover points (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes as prescribed in Part 95. The specified
IFR altitudes, when used in conjunction with the prescribed changeover points for those routes, ensure navigation
aid coverage that is adequate for safe flight operations and free of frequency interference. The reasons and circumstances
that create the need for this amendment involve matters of flight safety and operational efficiency in the National
Airspace System, are related to published aeronautical charts that are essential to the user, and provide for the
safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In addition, those various reasons or circumstances require making
this amendment effective before the next scheduled charting and publication date of the flight information to assure
its timely availability to the user. The effective date of this amendment reflects those considerations. In view
of the close and immediate relationship between these regulatory changes and safety in air commerce, I find that notice
and public procedure before adopting this amendment are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public
interest and that good cause exists for making the amendment effective in less than 30 days. The FAA has determined
that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments
are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order
12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979);
and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same
reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 437 (December 8, 1993)).

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 110) on January 3, 1994, contains the interim regulations that represent fulfillment of the obligations of
the United States under Paragraph 1 of Annex 311 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as implemented
under the North American Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 437 (December
8, 1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94&hyph;4, which did not represent a proper transcription from
the final version of edited drafts of the rules. Accordingly, some changes are made to remedy these transcription
errors. (An example of a transcription error was the inadvertent omission of many tariff shift rules in &sect;102.20(f)).
Other changes, also, are necessary to correct typographical errors, which if left uncorrected can have the effect
of changing the meaning of a specific provision. None of these corrections, however, represent a change of position
by Customs with respect to any of the rules published in T.D. 94&hyph;4.

&sect;102.20. Of special note is the definition of ``material'', another term that is used throughout this part.
Under paragraph (l), the term, ``material'' is defined as including ``parts'', ``ingredients'', ``subassemblies'',

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is amending its rules of practice and procedure to conform with the North American Free Trade Agreement
Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (December 8, 1993) (``NAFTA Implementation Act''). In
particular, these interim regulations implement title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for special
safeguard investigations and determinations with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles during the transition
period for tariff elimination under the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''), provide for certain findings
with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles in the course of an investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of
1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252), make certain conforming changes to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to treatment
of confidential business information, and direct the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules and regulations
as are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.'' These interim regulations
also implement title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act, which provides for issuance of administrative protective
orders for information required to be released in review by a binational panel of United States antidumping and countervailing
duty final determinations involving products from Canada or Mexico.

A. Part 206 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 8 of the NAFTA sets out the procedures and remedies available to domestic industries that have sustained,
or are threatened by, serious economic injury due to increased imports. Chapter 8 covers two different situations_actions
that can be taken against increased imports from a single NAFTA country due to injury caused by the phase-out of tariffs
under the NAFTA (``bilateral'' actions) and those that can be taken against imports from all sources (``global''
actions). In general, such bilateral actions may be taken during specified ``transition periods'' during which
duties on NAFTA-origin goods are being phased out. When taking global actions, NAFTA countries are called upon to
exclude goods originating in other NAFTA countries from the action when they are not a significant cause of the problem.
However, NAFTA imports initially excluded may be subsequently included if a surge in such imports is found to undermine
the effectiveness of the relief action. In several respects, the chapter tracks the emergency action provisions
in Chapter 11 of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``CFTA'') for both bilateral and global actions,
while adding Mexico to, and making certain changes in, the CFTA rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 8 of the NAFTA goes beyond Chapter 11 of the CFTA in several respects. The chapter establishes procedural rules
similar to those in current U.S. law and practice that each government will be required to follow in conducting investigations
leading to bilateral and global safeguard actions against goods from other NAFTA countries. These rules require,
among other things, the publication of notice of an investigation and its scope, the holding of a public hearing, protection
of confidential information, and publication of findings and the basis for those findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title III of the NAFTA Implementation Act (1) provides for special safeguard investigations and determinations
by the Commission with respect to Canadian and Mexican articles during the transition period of the Agreement; (2)
provides for Commission findings in the context of a global action safeguard investigation under section 202 of the
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252) to assist the President in determining whether imports from Canada or Mexico should
be excluded from the relief action; and (3), if imports from Canada and/or Mexico are excluded from the action, provides
for Commission investigations and findings with respect to whether there has been a surge in such excluded imports
which undermines the effectiveness of the relief action. Title III also makes certain conforming changes to section
202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2252) with respect to treatment of confidential business information. Section
317 of the NAFTA Implementation Act directs the Commission to ``adopt such procedures and rules and regulations as
are necessary to bring its procedures into conformity with chapter 8 of the Agreement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since August 29, 1988, the Commission has had in effect interim rules governing the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under sections 201&hyph;204 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2251&hyph;2254,
2436). See 53 FR 33036, Aug. 29, 1988. The amendments to these rules provide procedures for Commission investigations
and determinations with respect to imports from Canada or Mexico during the transition period of the Agreement; for
Commission findings in the context of a global action safeguard investigation under sections 201&hyph;202 of the
Trade Act of 1974 to assist the President in determining whether imports from Canada or Mexico should be excluded from
the relief action; and, if imports from Canada and/or Mexico are excluded from the action, for Commission investigations
and findings with respect to whether there has been a surge in such excluded imports which undermines the effectiveness
of the relief action. The amendments also set out Commission procedures regarding the protection of confidential
business information, and make certain technical changes to bring the rules into conformity with chapter 8 of NAFTA.
No changes except with respect to numbering were made to rules specifically relating to the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under sections 204 and 406 of the Trade Act. These amended interim rules are intended to replace
the existing rules as of January 1, 1994.

B. Subpart G of Part 207 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 19 of the NAFTA establishes a mechanism for resolving disputes between any two of the NAFTA countries with
respect to antidumping and countervailing duty cases. The central feature of the mechanism is the replacement of
domestic judicial review of determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from
another NAFTA country with review by binational panels. The NAFTA countries will continue to apply their own national
antidumping and countervailing duty laws to goods imported from the other country. In such cases, binational panels,
consisting of five panelists chosen by the countries involved in the dispute, will expeditiously review final determinations
under these laws to decide whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country
that made the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAFTA also provides for review of a panel decision by an extraordinary challenge committee (``Committee'') when
the government of one of the NAFTA countries alleges that a panelist materially violated the rules of conduct, or that
the panel seriously departed from a fundamental procedural rule or exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction.
The NAFTA requires that the NAFTA countries protect sensitive business information against unlawful disclosure
in both the panel review and extraordinary challenge processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends U.S. law to implement chapter 19 of the NAFTA by limiting judicial review
in cases involving Canadian or Mexican merchandise, establishing procedures whereby private parties may appeal
for binational panel review, providing organizational structure for administering U.S. responsibilities under
chapter 19 and making other conforming amendments to U.S. law. More specifically, section 402(g) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act authorizes the Commission to issue regulations to implement chapter 19 of the NAFTA, including extraordinary
challenge committee proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are intended to implement certain administrative procedures required by chapter 19 of the Agreement
involving administrative responsibilities of the Commission that continue during and after panel review. The regulations
address release of business proprietary and privileged information under administrative protective order during
a panel review, and sanctions for violations of the provisions of such protective orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since January 1, 1989, the Commission has had in effect either interim or final rules governing the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under the U.S.-Canada Free-Trade Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;449 (September
28, 1988) (``CFTA Implementation Act''). See 53 FR 53248, Dec. 30, 1988 (interim); 54 FR 36295, Sept. 1, 1989 (interim);
and 57 FR 34825, Aug. 6, 1992 (final). The amended interim rules issued herein, which govern the Commission's administrative
responsibilities under the NAFTA Implementation Act, for the most part track the existing rules applicable under
the CFTA Implementation Act. Unless otherwise noted, these rules are technical in nature, for example, replacing
references to Canada with references to the NAFTA country or references to the CFTA Agreement with references to the
NAFTA agreement. These amended interim rules are intended to replace the existing rules as of January 1, 1994.

of public comment on the proposed rules; (3) Commission review of such comments prior to developing final rules; and
(4) publication of the final rules thirty days prior to their effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553. That procedure could
not be utilized in this instance because the new legislation was enacted on December 8, 1993, and became effective
on January 1, 1994. Thus, it was not possible to complete the standard procedure prior to that date. The Commission
thus determined to adopt interim rules that go into effect as of January 1, 1994 and will remain in effect until the Commission
can adopt final rules promulgated in accordance with the usual notice, comment, and advance publication procedure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the requirement in the NAFTA Implementation Act that Commission rules be amended by the effective date
of the legislation, the Commission's authority to adopt interim rules without following all steps listed in section
553 of the APA is derived from two sources: (1) Section 335 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1335) and (2) provisions
of section 553 of the APA which allow an agency to dispense with various steps in the prescribed rule making procedures
under certain circumstances. The Commission has determined that the statutory requirement to have rules in place
by the effective date of the NAFTA constitutes appropriate circumstances to forego the steps listed in section 553
of the APA. Specifically, the Commission has determined that the requirement that amended rules take effect as of
January 1, 1994 makes the notice, comment and advance publication procedure impracticable in this instance and that
the amended interim rules constitute agency rules of procedure and practice for which notice of proposed rule making
is not required. Further, the Commission has determined that the requirement that amended rules be in place by the
enactment date of the legislation constitutes good cause to publish interim rules without providing thirty days
notice prior to their effective date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has also determined that these rules do not constitute major rules for the purposes of Executive Order
12291 (46 FR 13193, Feb. 17, 1981), because they do not meet the criteria described in section 1(b) of the EO. Finally,
the amendments, as interim rules, are not subject to the filing requirement of section 3(c)(3) of the EO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to these rules because they do not affect a large number of small entities,
and because the rules were not required by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act or by any other law to be promulgated
as a proposed rule before issuance as a final rule.

Explanation of Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to Part 206 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The title of part 206 is changed to refer to, among other things, ``global and bilateral safeguard actions,'' reflecting
the use of the term ``safeguards'' in the NAFTA Implementation Act and to distinguish between actions with respect
to imports from all countries (proceedings under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974) and actions with respect to imports
from a NAFTA country (proceedings under section 302(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act). The current title of this
part refers to, among other things, ``investigations relating to import injury to industries.'' The current title,
which historically has been used to refer to section 201-type proceedings, can be confusing to those not familiar
with Commission trade law terminology and has been misconstrued as describing proceedings under other statutory
provisions that the Commission administers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.1 is amended to state that part 206 applies to functions and duties of the Commission under sections 301&hyph;318
of the NAFTA Implementation Act and to state that subparts C and D of the rules apply to requests/petitions and investigations
under sections 312(c) and 302 of that Act, respectively. Former subparts C and D (relating to market disruption investigations
under section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2436) and monitoring and advice under section 204 of the Trade Act
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2254), respectively) are redesignated as subparts E and F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.2, which provides for the identification of petitions, is amended to include references to sections
312(c) and 302 of the NAFTA Implementation Act in the list of statutory provisions under which petitions under this
part may be filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.3 is divided into three subsections and amended to describe the information that the Commission is to
include in a notice when it institutes an investigation, and to state that the Commission will promptly make the petition
or request available for public inspection (with the exception of confidential business information). This latter
amendment conforms the Commission rules to paragraphs 4 and 5 of NAFTA Annex 803.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.4 is amended to state that the Commission will also transmit copies of requests (relating to a surge in
imports from a NAFTA country) to the USTR and certain other agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.5, concerning public hearings, is divided into three subsections and amended to distinguish between
investigations under subpart B, in which the Commission is required to hold separate hearings on injury and remedy,
and investigations under subparts C, D, and E, in which the Commission holds only one hearing on both issues, to the
extent appropriate. Additional language states that interested parties and consumers, including any association
representing the interests of consumer, may appear and may cross-question interested parties making presentations
at a hearing; this latter amendment conforms the rule to section 7(b) of NAFTA Annex 803.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.6, concerning the Commission's report to the President, simplifies the existing description and also
states that the Commission will include, in the case of a report containing a determination under section 302(b) of
the NAFTA Implementation Act, certain findings with respect to factors other than imports that may be a cause of serious
injury or threat thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.7, states that the Commission, in the case of an investigation under subparts B, C, or D of this part, will
not release information considered to be confidential business information unless the party submitting the information
had notice, at the time of submission, that such information would be released by the Commission, or such party subsequently
consents to the release of the information. This rule reflects an amendment made by section 317(b) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act to section 202(a) of the Trade Act. Paragraph 8 of NAFTA Annex 803.3 requires that the investigating authority
in a NAFTA country adopt or maintain procedures for the treatment of confidential information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B, which relates to investigations filed under section 201 of the Trade Act, is retitled ``Investigations
Relating to Global Safeguard Actions'', reflecting in part the change in the title of part 206.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;206.12, the definition of perishable agricultural product is simplified to take into account the fact that
certain monitoring is required by statute (section 316 of the NAFTA Implementation Act). Also, reference is made
to citrus products to reflect the amendment made by section 315 of the NAFTA Implementation Act to section 202(d) of
the Trade Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.14, concerning the contents of petitions, is amended in several minor respects. The introductory paragraph
is amended at the end to provide that the petition is to include certain information ``to the extent that such information
is publicly available from governmental or other sources, or best estimates and the basis therefor if such information
is not available''. This amendment conforms &sect;206.14 with paragraph 3 of NAFTA Annex 803.3. A new paragraph (3)
is added to subsection (e) to state that the petition is to contain data relating to changes in the level of prices, production,
and productivity, also conforming &sect;206.14 with paragraph 3(e) of NAFTA Annex 803.3 regarding the contents
of petitions. Also, a new subsection (i) is added to state that petitions are to include data indicating the share of
imports accounted for by imports from each NAFTA country, and petitioner's view concerning the extent to which such
imports are contributing importantly to the serious injury or threat thereof. This conforms &sect;206.14 with paragraph
3(g) of NAFTA Annex 803.3. Finally, a new subsection (j) is added to set out the dates by which any allegations of critical
circumstances must be included within the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart C is new, and the title states that it pertains to investigations relating to a surge in imports from a NAFTA
country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.21 states that subpart C applies to investigations under section 312(c) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act, which provides for Commission investigations and determinations when there has been a surge in imports of an
article from Canada or Mexico that has been excluded from a U.S. global safeguard action with respect to such article.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.22 defines the term ``surge'' to mean a significant increase in imports over the trend for a recent representative
base period. This definition tracks the definition in section 312(c)(3) of the NAFTA Implementation Act and Article
805 of the NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.23 states that a request for an investigation under this Subpart may be filed by any entity that is representative
of the industry for which the global action is being taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.24 describes the information that a request for an investigation is to contain, including the identity
of the requestor, the article and its tariff provision, the name of the country or countries from which the surge is
coming, information with respect to representativeness, and data and information supporting the allegation that
a surge in imports has occurred and that such surge undermines the effectiveness of the relief action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.25 states that the Commission will submit its findings to the President no later than 30 days after receiving
the request for an investigation, as required by section 312(c)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.26 states that the Commission will make its report to the President available to the public (with the exception
of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart D is new, and the title states that it pertains to investigations relating to bilateral safeguard actions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.31 states that subpart D applies to investigations under section 302(b) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.32 defines the terms ``critical circumstances'' and ``perishable agricultural product'' in the same
manner as in &sect;206.12 of the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.33 states who may file a petition. Subsection (a) states that a request for an investigation under this
Subpart may be filed by any entity that is representative of a domestic industry producing an article like or directly
competitive with a Canadian or Mexican article that is allegedly, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty
provided for under the NAFTA, being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions so that imports
of the article alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to such industry. Subsection
(b) states who may file a petition with respect to imports from Canada or Mexico of a perishable agricultural product.
Subsection (c) makes reference to the fact that the President is authorized to take a bilateral action with respect
to an article from Canada or Mexico during the appropriate period provided for in section 305(a) of the NAFTA Implementation
Act, or thereafter but only if the Government of Canada or Mexico, as the case may be, consents to such provision (see
section 305(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act). The periods set out in section 305(a) are the transition periods
for tariff elimination in the U.S. schedules in the CFTA and NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.34 describes the information that is to be included in a petition for an investigation. This section generally
tracks &sect;206.14 of these rules concerning contents of petitions, except that the introductory paragraph tracks
the wording of the standard applicable in a bilateral safeguard investigation involving a NAFTA country, the import
data section requires data concerning Canadian or Mexican imports as appropriate, and the statement called for in
&sect;206.14(i) concerning imports from NAFTA countries is not included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.35 implements the time requirements for Commission determinations and reports in section 303(a) and
(c) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, and states that the Commission will make its injury determination within 120
days of the initiation of an investigation, and submit its report to the President no later than 30 days thereafter.
Time requirements for determinations in investigations involving imports of perishable agricultural products
or allegations of critical circumstances are also specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206.36 states that the Commission will make its report to the President available to the public (with the exception
of confidential business information) and cause a summary thereof to be published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subparts E and F, relating to investigations for relief from market disruption, and monitoring and advice as to effect
of extension, reduction, modification, or termination of relief, respectively, are unchanged from previous subparts
C and D. However, the various rule sections have been renumbered to reflect the revised order in part 206.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to Subpart G to Part 207 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 207.90 currently indicates that subpart G implements Article 1904 of the CFTA Implementation Act. The amendment
to this section expands the scope of subpart G to cover procedures and regulations for implementation of Article 1904
of the NAFTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.91 provides definitions of terms used in subpart G. The definitions of ``Agreement'', ``Article 1904
Rules'' and ``FTA'' have been amended to reflect the change from the CFTA to the NAFTA. The amended definitions also
reflect that, in the event that the United States or Canada withdraws from the NAFTA, the CFTA would still apply to the
United States and Canada, and that these rules would apply to binational panel reviews between those two countries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A definition has been added for ``ECC Rules'', and references to these rules have been added to the definition of ``counsel''
and to the general provision incorporating definitions set forth in the Article 1904 and ECC Rules. Definitions have
been added for ``Free Trade Area Country,'' ``Mexican Secretary,'' and ``Relevant FTA Secretary,'' reflecting
the provisions of the NAFTA and the implementing legislation. Specific cross-references to 1904 Panel and ECC Rules
have been deleted from the definition of ``Notice of Appearance'' to avoid confusion that may result from subsequent
renumbering of the 1904 Panel and ECC Rules. Finally, the definition of the term ``Persons'' has been changed to ``Person''
for reasons of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.93 covers the protection of proprietary information during panel and committee proceedings. Subsections
(b)(4), (b)(6), (c)(2)(ii)(E), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(v) have been amended to include references to the Mexican Government,
government officials or Secretary where appropriate. Subsection (c)(4)(B) has been amended to reference the ECC
Rules as well as the Article 1904 Rules. Specific cross-references have been deleted, however, to avoid confusion
that might result from subsequent renumbering of these rules. Subsections (c)(4), (c)(5), (f)(1) and (f)(2) have
been amended to change the number of copies of documents filed with the Commission Secretary from six (or seven in the
case of subsection (c)(5)(ii)(B)) to three. Subsection (d) has been corrected to indicate that only panel members
in reviews conducted under the CFTA should send a countersigned copy of their administrative protective orders to
the United States Secretary to notify the Secretary that he or she may transmit documents containing proprietary
information. Annex 1901.2(7)(a) of the NAFTA requires that panelists sign an application for a protective order,
but unlike Annex 1901.2(7)(a) of the CFTA, does not require panelists to sign a copy of the protective order itself.
Subsection (d)(2)(ii) has been amended to make explicit that the Secretary may deny an application for a protective
order by informing the applicant of the reasons for such denial within fourteen days of the Secretary's receipt of
an application therefor. Subsection (f)(5) has also been revised to indicate that the Commission Secretary is required
to provide the United States Secretary with a copy of any amendment, modification, or revocation of a protective order
issued during panel proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.94 addresses the protection of privileged information during Panel and Committee proceedings. The
text has been corrected to specifically reference Committees as well as Panels. The term ``Secretary'' has been modified
to ``Commission Secretary'' for clarity purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 207.100 covers sanctions for prohibited acts under these regulations. The Tariff Act, as amended by section
403(c) of the CFTA Implementation Act, authorized the Commission to impose sanctions against any person who is found
by the Commission to have violated, or induced violation of, the terms of a protective order issued by the Commission
for CFTA purposes. 19 U.S.C. 1677f(f)(4). Section 412(b)(8) of the NAFTA Implementation Act amends this provision
to exclude from its coverage judges sitting on courts created under article III of the United States Constitution
who are appointed to NAFTA binational panels or committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules contained in &sect;&sect;207.100&hyph;207.120 address the Commission's procedures for imposing sanctions
under the statutory provision added by the CFTA Implementation Act. The same procedures will apply with respect to
the imposition of sanctions for violations of the terms of protective orders issued by the Commission for NAFTA purposes.
Subsection 207.100(a) has been amended, however, to reflect the statutory exclusion of federal judges from the persons
who may be subject to sanctions under the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 207.102(b) addresses Commission determinations on recommendations made by the Office of Unfair Import
Investigations on the initiation of sanction proceedings. A reference to ``OUII'' in this subsection has been changed
to the ``Office of Unfair Import Investigations'' because ``OUII'' is not a defined term in these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 207.102(d) currently addresses, among other matters, the situations in which it may be appropriate to
request the authorized agency of Canada to initiate proceedings under Canadian law on the basis of an alleged violation
of the protective order. By changing the references to ``Canada'' to ``another Free Trade Agreement country,'' this
provision now will provide for the referral of an investigation to Mexico or to Canada, as may be appropriate in the
circumstances. Section 207.120, which provides for public notice of sanctions has been amended to provide for notice
to appropriate Mexican, as well as United States and Canadian, agencies.

for other reasons an authorized agency of another Free Trade Area country would be the more appropriate forum for initiation
of a proceeding, the Commission shall take the necessary steps for issuance of a letter requesting the authorized

act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Commission may make any determination regarding notification about the alleged prohibited act and the relevant
underlying facts to the persons who submitted the proprietary information that allegedly has been disclosed. A determination

 Suspension. Each milliliter contains 25 milligrams (mg) of neomycin sulfate, 10,000 international units (IU's)
of penicillin G procaine, 5,000 IU's of polymyxin B sulfate, 2 mg of hydrocortisone acetate, and 1.25 mg of hydrocortisone
sodium succinate for the topical treatment of dogs for summer eczema, atopic dermatitis, interdigital eczema, and
otitis externa caused by bacteria susceptible to neomycin, penicillin, and polymyxin B. The product was originally
approved on September 15, 1959. Accordingly, the regulations in 21 CFR 524.1484h are amended to reflect approval
of the NADA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

this application is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31&blank;CFR part
550 (the ``LSR''), to revoke &sect;550.516, which unblocked, by general license, deposits in currencies other than
U.S. dollars held by U.S. persons abroad, if otherwise blocked under the LSR. FAC's amendment is consistent with action
by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 883 of November 11, 1993. The Security Council determined in
that resolution that the continued failure of the Government of Libya (``GOL'') to demonstrate by concrete actions
its renunciation of terrorism, and in particular the GOL's continued failure to respond fully and effectively to
the requests and decisions of the Security Council in Resolutions 731 and 748, concerning the bombing of the Pan Am
103 and UTA 772 flights, constituted a threat to international peace and security. Accordingly, Resolution 883 called
upon member states, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to freeze certain GOL financial assets in their territories, and to ensure that their nationals did not make such
funds or any other funds or financial resources available to the GOL or any entity owned or controlled by the GOL. In
light of this resolution, FAC is revoking &sect;550.516 to eliminate an exception that had existed to the comprehensive
blocking of GOL property required by Executive Order 12544 of January 8, 1986 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 183) and by the LSR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the LSR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service
connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This amendment is necessary
to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of
1991 that there is an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The intended effect of
this amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions based on herbicide exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a), 3.309(e), and 3.311a to establish presumptive service connection
for Hodgkin's disease and PCT based on exposure to herbicides in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50528&hyph;30). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections concerning the proposal on or before October 28, 1993. Since no comments were received, the proposed
amendments are adopted without change.

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

 (i) For the purposes of this section, the term ``herbicide agent'' means a chemical in an herbicide used in support
of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, specifically:
2,4&hyph;D; 2,4,5&hyph;T and its contaminant TCDD; cacodylic acid; and picloram.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The diseases listed at &sect;3.309(e) shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after
service, except that chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne and porphyria cutanea tarda
shall have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was
exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and has a disease listed at &sect;3.309(e) shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide
agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during
that service. The last date on which such a veteran shall be presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent shall
be the last date on which he or she served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. ``Service in the Republic
of Vietnam'' includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved
duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.

 This action amends 40 CFR part 60, subpart O, Standards of Performance for Sewage Treatment Plants. Specifically,
provisions requiring metals analysis of air samples and sludge samples are deleted. This deletion is occasioned
by the promulgation of final regulations under section 405(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) on February 19, 1993, which
eliminates the reason for metals testing under this subpart.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart O of 40 CFR part 60 establishes New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), pursuant to section 111 of the Clean
Air Act (Act) for new, modified or reconstructed sewage sludge incinerators. The NSPS limits emissions of particulate
matter (PM) discharged to the atmosphere to 0.65 g/kg dry sludge input (1.30 lb/ton dry sludge input) and the opacity
of any gases discharged to 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the NSPS presents test methods and procedures for compliance demonstration. Among these is paragraph
60.154(d) (3)&hyph;(5) which calls for the analysis of air emissions samples collected by EPA method 5 and composite
samples of sludge for ten metals. This requirement was added to the October 6, 1988 regulation because, ``*&blank;*&blank;*
EPA's intention (is) to consolidate existing waste management authorities with the broad authorities provided
under section 405 of the CWA. Section 405(d) of the CWA requires EPA to develop regulations for the use and disposal
of sewage sludge. The measurement of metals will assist the Agency in establishing guidelines for State and local
sludge management programs. Also, this will assist the Agency in determining if future regulatory action is warranted.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As EPA has promulgated the final sewage sludge regulations pursuant to section 405(d) of the CWA (published February
19, 1993 (58 FR 9248)), with requirements for testing and control of metals from sewage sludge incinerators that supersede
the provisions of &sect;60.154(d)(3) through (5), there is no longer a need to collect data on metals emissions and
the metals content of sludge for the development of the CWA regulations pursuant to &sect;60.154(d)(3) through (5).
Therefore, 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) shall be deleted from
&sect;60.154. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA hereby publishes this amendment to Subpart O to delete paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) to eliminate duplicate
and conflicting metal testing requirements for sewage sludge incinerators that are regulated under the Act and the
CWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective April 4, 1994 unless, within 30 days of publication,
notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publication of a further notice.
That notice will withdraw the final action and begin a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment
period.

 In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54355), EPA issued a notice announcing that E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., had submitted
a food/feed additive petition (FAP 3H5659) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR parts 185 and 186, under section 409 of the
FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 348, by establishing a tolerance in or on citrus oil and increasing tolerances in or on dried citrus
pulp, dried apple pomace, and raisin waste for the combined residues of hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane
and its organotin metabolites calculated as hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane. The Agency has determined
that citrus oil may be a human food, and a tolerance in or on citrus oil must be included in 40 CFR 185.3550. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tolerances exist for residues in citrus fruits, apples, and grapes (40 CFR 180.362). Studies submitted in support
of the reregistration of hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane showed that it concentrates during the
processing of these commodities. The Agency requested that Du Pont submit a food additive petition that proposed
tolerances that would be adequate for the increased concentrations of residues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful
for the purpose for which the tolerances are sought and capable of achieving its intended physical or technical effect.
The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A subchronic rat feeding study (data requirements satisfied by the chronic rat study) with a no-observed-effect
level (NOEL) of 50 parts per million (ppm) and a lowest-effect level (LEL) of 100 ppm, based on increased BUN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 21-day rabbit dermal toxicity study with systemic NOEL greater than 5 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) of body weight/day
and dermal NOEL of 0.05 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on erythema and edema.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A chronic rat feeding/carcinogenicity study with NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg of body weight/day) and
LEL of 600 ppm (equivalent to 30 mg/kg of body weight/day), based on increased alkaline phosphatase and testes weight.
Under the study conditions carcinogenic potential was not demonstrated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A chronic dog feeding study with NOEL of 5 mg/kg of body weight/day and LEL of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on
vomiting and diarrhea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A mouse carcinogenicity study with NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 15 mg/kg of body weight/day) and LEL of 300 ppm (equivalent
to 45 mg/kg of body weight/day) based on decreased body weights. Under the study conditions carcinogenic potential
was not demonstrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A rat developmental toxicity study with maternal NOEL of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day and maternal LEL of 30 mg/kg
of body weight/day, based on postimplantation loss and decreased body weight. The developmental NOEL was 30 mg/kg
of body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A rabbit developmental toxicity study with a maternal/developmental NOEL of 1 mg/kg of body weight/day and a maternal/developmental
LEL of 5 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on slightly decreased maternal body weight/intrauterine mortality. Maternal
death resulted at 10 mg/kg of body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A two-generation rat reproduction study with maternal/reproductive NOEL of 75 ppm (5.2 mg/kg of body weight/day
in males and 5.98 mg/kg of body weight/day in females) and maternal/reproductive LEL of 250 ppm (17.4 mg/kg of body
weight/day in males and 20.3 mg/kg of body weight/day in females), based on decreased maternal body weight and food
consumption and decreased pup body weight during lactation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Ames gene mutation assay was negative up to cytotoxic levels. 10. Several other mutagenicity studies that were
all negative. These include a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutation assay, a human lymphocyte assay for chromosomal
aberration, and an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. A general metabolism study in rats shows that bioaccumulation is low, with the highest levels found in the liver,
heart, and kidneys. Most is excreted unchanged within 72 hours in the feces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) based on the two-generation rat reproduction study (NOEL of 5.2 mg/kg of body weight/day
for reduced body weight and food consumption in both sexes of pups of the first and second generations) and using a 100-fold
uncertainty factor is calculated to be 0.05 mg/kg of body weight/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution
(TMRC) from existing tolerances is calculated to be 0.068104 mg/kg of body weight/day. The current action will not
increase the TMRC, and no dietary risk exposure analysis was conducted. Published tolerances for meat and milk will
cover any secondary residues that may result from use as feed items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate gas chromatographic analytical methods are available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM
II), for enforcement purposes. There are currently no actions pending against continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR 185.3550 and
186.3550 would protect the public health and use of the pesticide would be safe. Therefore, the tolerances are established
as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted
must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25.
Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections
must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each
such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial
issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established,
resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the
contrary; the resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify
the action requested. 40 CFR 178.32.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the Monroe Township Landfill Superfund
site in Middlesex County, New Jersey from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300,
the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to section
105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended.
EPA and the State of New Jersey have determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been
implemented and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New
Jersey have determined that remedial actions conducted at the site to date remain protective of public health, welfare,
and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of itent to delete for this site was published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63551). The closing date for comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the notice of intent to delete was January 3, 1994. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received no comments and therefore has not prepared a Responsiveness Summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment
and it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Hazardous Substance Response
Trust Fund (Fund)&hyph;financed remedial actions. Section 300.425(e)(3) of the NCP states that Fund-financed
actions may be taken at sites deleted from the NPL in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action.
Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs
associated with response efforts.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is eliminating the Uniform System of Accounts for common and contract motor carriers of property.
In addition, the Commission is revising the report form designations for class I and class II motor carriers of property
and is changing the classification threshold levels for classes I, II, and III motor carriers. The intent of these
changes is to reduce regulatory and accounting burdens for these carriers and to create a simplified report form for
those carriers earning between $3 and $10 million in annual operating revenues. Use of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), in lieu of the Uniform System of Accounts, and simplified annual reports for class II carriers
permit the Commission to carry out fully its regulatory oversight functions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 28, 1992 at 57 FR 33314. Based on comments received in response to that notice, the Commission is revising the
Code of Federal Regulations by eliminating 49 CFR part 1207 and modifying 49 CFR part 1249. Also, annual reports for
motor carriers of property are being modified, with two annual report forms being designated; Form M&hyph;1 (essentially
identical to the old Form M) for class I carriers, and a simplified Form M&hyph;2 for class II carriers. Additional
information is contained in the Commission's decision. To receive a copy of the full decision, write to, call, or pick
up in person from: Dynamic Concepts, Inc., room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building, Washington, DC 20423.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. No new regulatory requirements are imposed, directly or indirectly, on
such entities. The purpose of our regulation is to reduce regulatory burden for the motor carriers. The economic impact
on small entities, if any, will be to reduce the cost of maintaining and preparing reports to the Commission, and is
not likely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Class I.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of $10 million or more
after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Class I.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of at least $3 million
but less than $10 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of less than
$3 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by annual carrier operating revenues (excluding
revenues from private carriage, compensated intercorporate hauling, and leasing vehicles with drivers to private
carriers) after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A. Upward and downward classification will be effected
as of January 1 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year of revenue qualification.

(4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in classification and any change in annual operating revenues
that causes them to exceed the class I limit by writing to the Office of Economics, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423. In unusual or extraordinary extenuating circumstances, where the classification process
will unduly burden the carrier, such as partial liquidation, or curtailment or elimination of contracted services,
the carrier may request from the Commission a waiver or an exception from these regulations. This request shall be
in writing, specifying the conditions justifying the waiver or exception. The Commission shall notify the carriers
of any change in classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Carriers not required to file an Annual Report (Form M&hyph;1 or Form M&hyph;2) may be required to file the Annual
Carrier Classification Survey Form. All carriers will be notified of any classification changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 annually an index number which shall be used to adjust gross annual operating revenues. This index number (deflator)
shall be based on the Producers Price Index of Finished Goods. Its intended use is to eliminate the effects of inflation
from the classification process. See Note A that follows:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS, upon application from the U.S. Department of the Navy (Navy), issues regulations to govern the unintentional
take of a small number of marine mammals incidental to a wide variety of proposed Navy projects involving the underwater
detonation of conventional explosives in the offshore waters of the Outer Sea Test Range (OSTR) of the Naval Air Warfare
Center (NAWC), Pt. Mugu, Ventura County, CA, over the next 5 years. Issuance of regulations governing unintentional
incidental takes in connection with particular activities is required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)
when the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), after notice and opportunity for comment, finds as here, that such takes
will have a negligible impact on the species and stocks and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability
of them for subsistence uses. These regulations do not authorize the Navy's proposed activities, such authorization
is provided by the National Defense Authorization Act and is not within the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Rather,
these regulations authorize the unintentional incidental take of marine mammals in connection with such activities
and prescribe methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the species and
its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses.

.) directs the Secretary to allow, upon request by U.S. citizens engaged in a specific activity (other than commercial
fishing) in a specified geographical region, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine
mammals, if certain findings are made and regulations are issued. Under the MMPA, the term ``taking'' means to harass,
hunt, capture or kill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permission may be granted for periods up to 5 years if the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for public
comment, that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) of marine mammals and will not have
an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses. In addition, the
Secretary must prescribe regulations that include permissible methods of taking and other means effecting the least
practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence
uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds and areas of similar significance. The regulations
must include requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.

In 1986, the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) were amended to allow incidental takings of depleted, endangered, or threatened marine
mammals. Before the 1986 amendments, section 101(a)(5) applied only to non-depleted marine mammals, and the more
restrictive provisions of the MMPA prevailed, which meant that an incidental take of endangered or depleted marine
mammals could not be allowed even if the anticipated take would result in only negligible impacts.

Summary of Request

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 13, 1993, NMFS received an application from the Navy for a Letter of Authorization (LOA) under section 101(a)(5)
of the MMPA and 50 CFR 228.6, that would allow the unintentional take of small numbers of pinnipeds and cetaceans for
a period of 5 years, commencing February 1994, incidental to a wide variety of military projects involving the underwater
detonation of conventional explosives in the offshore waters of the OSTR of the NAWC, off Pt. Mugu, Ventura County,
CA, seaward of the Channel Islands. This application was made available for public review on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 31944).
NMFS requested comments, information and suggestions concerning the request and the structure and content of the
regulations governing the take. The comment period closed on July 7, 1993. The application was subsequently modified
by letter on September 2, 1993 to request an incidental take for two additional species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the Navy describes its proposed activities under the ``Live Fire'' testing program mandated by the National Defense
Authorization Act (10 U.S.C. 139), ships and critical components or systems constructed for the Navy must undergo
shock tests prior to service with the fleet to determine the integrity of the structure and electronic systems that
are vital to the overall function and performance of the vessel and its crew under wartime combat conditions. This
is especially true when a new class of ship is constructed. The new ship must be subjected to a ``near-miss'' underwater
explosion while its crew tracks airborne and waterborne targets in the area. These tests help the Navy identify weaknesses
in the ship's design early in the construction of a new class of ship, which, when corrected, enhance the survivability
of the ship, its systems, and most importantly, its crew. The design corrections and improvements are then applied
to all follow-on ships of that class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shock trial is a complicated combat simulation that requires the participation of several Navy aircraft and ships.
Their purpose is to challenge the shock trial ship's tracking and communications systems after the detonation. To
ensure the safety of commercial aircraft and vessels, the Navy must conduct these trials in an area where they can maintain
control of air and sea space while the trial is being conducted. In addition, the site must be close to the repair facilities,
should the ship become disabled. Under normal conditions, for Navy ships homeported on the west coast, the designated
site is the OSTR, which is under the jurisdiction of the NAWC. The Navy anticipates that on an annual basis, no more than
10 projects involving underwater explosions will be conducted under the requested LOA (Table 1).

The Navy has requested a take of four species of pinnipeds and 17 species (or species groups) of cetaceans by harassment,
injury and death (Table 2). The proposed activities would occur in the Southern California Bight (SCB), an area with
a potentially high density of marine mammals. Potential impacts to marine mammals include both lethal and non-lethal
injuries, as well as physical and acoustic harassment. Injury or death may occur as a direct result of the explosive
blast (concussion) itself. Injury may include damage to internal organs, as well as to the auditory system. Harassment
of marine mammals may occur as a result of non-injurious physiological responses to both the explosion-generated
shockwave, as well as to the acoustic signature of the detonation.

The Navy describes in its application efforts that will be made to minimize project related impacts to marine mammals
(see below_Measures to Reduce Impacts). The Navy strongly believes that impacts can be held to an acceptably low level
by mandating conservative safety zones for marine mammal exclusion and by incorporating an active aerial survey
monitoring effort in the program both prior to, and after, detonation of explosives. The Navy states that tests will
not be conducted if marine mammals, sea turtles, fish schools, or seabirds are detected within the safety zone, or
if weather and sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance. Also, if post-test surveys determine that
an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure and the monitoring methods will be reviewed
by the Navy and NMFS and appropriate changes will be made.

regulations (58 FR 53491) authorizing and governing the unintentional taking of a small number of pinnipeds and cetaceans
incidental to the Navy's underwater explosives detonations program in the OSTR. Public meetings were held on November

Comments and Responses

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 45-day comment period, NMFS received several hundred letters and photocopied form letters from the general
public, all but 4 of which were in opposition either to the detonation of explosives in the SCB or to the proposed regulations.
Most of these comments did not address the contents of the Navy's application, the proposed regulations, or the EA.
Instead, the commenters stated their opposition to the Navy's proposed activities because there would be a loss of
marine life; because they believed aerial surveys were inadequate; and because they believed there would be an adverse
impact on pregnant gray whales. In addition, NMFS received approximately 75 letters or hearing statements within
the comment period that substantially discussed the issues and science upon which the proposed regulations were
based.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navy conducts ship shock tests under the authority of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Navy does not
require NMFS authorization to conduct these tests. However, under the MMPA, the taking of marine mammals is prohibited
unless authorized by exemption or permit. Since there is a possibility that marine mammals may be unintentionally
taken incidental to the ship shock trials, the Navy applied to NMFS for a small take authorization under section 101(a)(5)
of the MMPA. Thus, it is the taking of marine mammals incidental to the Navy's ship shock tests that NMFS is authorizing.

One commenter believed that section 101(a) of the MMPA, under which the Navy is seeking permission for an unintentional
take, is not appropriate for the Navy's purposes, as it was written to allow for indigenous groups to fish for subsistence.
Others believe the MMPA is to protect marine mammals and that no takings under a LOA should be authorized.

NMFS does not agree. Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was enacted in 1981 specifically to provide a means to authorize
incidental takes in connection with legitimate maritime activities other than commercial or subsistence fishing.
Prior to 1981, these incidental takes were prohibited by the MMPA moratorium on taking and any such takings were subject
to prosecution under the MMPA.

Commenters stated that NMFS cannot make a finding of negligible impact unless the impact is small, and of little consequence.
Also, if the potential effects would be significant, NMFS cannot make a finding of negligible impact.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under NMFS' regulatory definition (50 CFR 228.4), a negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity
that cannot reasonably be expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock of marine
mammal through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival. The 1986 amendments to the MMPA altered the previous
standard for determining negligible impact. Prior to the 1986 amendments, the taking from the impact had to be ``so
small, unimportant, or of so little consequence as to warrant little or no attention.'' However, after the 1986 amendment,
NMFS adopted the definition of negligible impact set out in the Senate's Section-by-Section Analysis (132 Cong.
Rec. S16305, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 15, 1986). Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA clearly indicates that some level of adverse effects involving the
take of depleted marine mammals can be authorized so long as the impact is negligible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the taking of 1,917 marine mammals annually does not represent a ``small number.''
Another commenter considered the requested take to not have a ``negligible impact.'' This commenter and several
others also state that an incidental take exceeding 9,600 marine mammals over the 5-year period is not small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the EA, because not all species of marine mammals would be expected to be found within the vicinity of a test
site during any particular test, the take estimates should not be considered additive for the purposes of determining
whether the incidental take is small. The MMPA requires NMFS to authorize incidental takes on a species/stock basis
based upon the best scientific information available. Therefore, even though it is extremely unlikely that more
than a few species/stocks would be present at any one time in the offshore waters of the SCB, authorizations must be
made on a species basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because NMFS and the Navy cannot know in advance which of these species would be within the SCB at the time
of a test, the Navy found it necessary to design its request as though all species/stocks recorded as inhabiting the
offshore waters of the SCB would be within the safety zone, even though the probability of that happening is considered
extremely remote. For that reason, as noted in the EA, NMFS considers the taking request (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1,917 marine mammals) to reflect a ``worst-case scenario.'' This is also true for the total taking over 5 years; the
statutory requirement is for a determination that the total taking (over the 5-year authorization period) would
have a negligible impact (see previous response).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA requires [regulations regarding] the protection of rookeries.
This commenter also believes NMFS failed to consider impacts upon other marine species. For example, the commenter
stated that the EA does not mention impacts upon the migratory routes of gray whales and other migratory species and
that it fails to ``pay particular attention'' to these significant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS does not agree. The EA notes that the underwater explosives detonations will have no impacts on marine mammals
that are ashore at the time of detonation; therefore, without information to the contrary, regulations are unnecessary
to protect onshore rookeries. In addition, the best available scientific information indicates that the requested
taking will have no more than a negligible impact on the populations of marine mammals inhabiting the waters of the
SCB, their mating grounds, migratory routes and other areas of similar significance. The EA discusses fully the impacts
on those marine species believed to frequent the test area, including gray whales, other marine mammals and other
species. The EA indicated that no gray whales were sighted within Area 2 and NMFS therefore concluded that no gray whales
will be killed and that only three would incur non-lethal injuries. For the same reasons the migratory routes of gray
whales will be unaffected by the short-term impacts from the detonation itself. Moreover, gray whales are resilient
to human activities and will reoccupy areas once the activity ceases (see 58 FR 3121, January 7, 1993), further limiting
expected impacts.

One commenter stated that the MMPA requires NMFS to prescribe regulations that restrict, among other things, ``the
season or the period of time within which animals may be taken'' and the ``manner and locations in which animals may
be taken.''

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the provisions of section 103 of the MMPA do not apply for small takes under section 101(a)(5), seasonal restrictions
are viewed by NMFS as one method of reducing takes. However, there is no scientific evidence at this time to indicate
that there is any one period of the year when marine mammals are not within the OSTR. Although population assessment
research in the SCB, currently underway, will be reviewed to determine if seasonal restrictions would result in lower
incidental takes, because the marine environment of the SCB is dynamic and significantly influenced by oceanographic
factors such as El Ni&ntilde;o, this might not be practical on a long-term basis. However, the Navy will be required
to locate the areas within the OSTR that have the lowest numbers of marine mammals and to conduct its tests within those
areas.

Several commenters noted the number of species requested for taking that are either depleted under the MMPA or threatened
or endangered under the ESA (and should not be taken).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, both the MMPA and the ESA were amended to allow incidental takings of depleted, endangered, or threatened
marine mammals. Before the 1986 amendments, section 101(a)(5) applied only to non-depleted marine mammals, which
meant that an incidental take of endangered or depleted marine mammals could not be authorized even if the anticipated
take would result in only negligible impacts. However, both the MMPA and ESA now specifically provide for authorization
of such takes, so long as the requisite findings can be made. As required by the ESA, NMFS has consulted with the Navy
under section 7 (refer to response under ``Endangered Species Act Concerns'' below for additional information on
section 7 consultation). A copy of the Biological Opinion resulting from that consultation is available upon request

One commenter opposed the project because, among other things, estimated takes presented by the Navy are calculated
from models that may be based on invalid assumptions. The commenter continues that even though NMFS believes the takes
will have a proportionally minor impact on the large local populations of marine mammals, hundreds, if not thousands,
of animals will be harassed by the detonations, while a sizable number will potentially be injured and killed.

The two assumptions that may not be valid were discussed fully in the application and the EA. These are (1) that species
are distributed uniformly in space and time, and (2) that pinniped species are in the water all year. The first assumption
is discussed in the following response and under ``Population Assessment Methodology,'' below. The latter assumption
is misleading because many of these animals will be on the beach for 1&hyph;3 months during breeding and/or molting
cycles; use of this assumption (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that all pinnipeds are in the water all the time) leads to a higher incidental take estimate, not a lower one. The negligible
impact determination under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA was discussed above.

Two commenters were concerned that the distribution of marine mammals was difficult to predict because marine mammals
exhibit associative, or clumped distributions. This, one of the commenters believes, could cause the incidental
take number to be lower or higher than requested.

Response:

NMFS agrees. Those marine mammal species that tend towards group association could be subjected to a higher incidental
take on a single detonation, provided their behavior also includes all individuals in the school diving at the same
time, thereby making the entire pod or school invisible to observers. It is also just as likely that, because of grouping
or clumping behavior, during the 4-week period for a ship shock trial, random distribution of the school(s) would
mean that this species would not be within the safety zone at the time of testing, and therefore not subject to take.
However, should the annual taking authorization for any species be reached, then any future takings would be considered
to be in violation of the LOA, the implementing regulations and the MMPA.

On a related issue, one commenter questioned whether it was a ``conservative approach'' to estimate mysticete (baleen
whales) abundance (from which incidental take estimates are calculated), by using ``California-wide estimates
and `scaling' them to the focal area.'' This commenter also questioned the incidental take calculations for California
sea lions, since the females and young apparently remain in the area year-round.

NMFS believes the calculations for mysticete abundance is a conservative approach. As noted in the EA, during aerial
surveys in the winter/spring period, blue whales were the only mysticete species observed within Area 2 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the OSTR). Based upon this observation, an incidental take authorization for mysticetes should include only blue
whales. However, because of the migratory nature of mysticetes, a conservative approach was taken, which was to request
additional mysticete species based upon the method mentioned by the commenter.

While California sea lions are the most abundant pinniped species in the SCB, because they are more likely to remain
closer to islands and the coastline, fewer are expected to be in the area of the test. Therefore, fewer animals are anticipated
to be incidentally taken.

One commenter was concerned that takes by physical harassment is not defined, that harassment parameters are based
upon tests on humans in an air environment, and the relationship between avoidance behavior caused by aircraft and
that of the detonation. This commenter (and others) was also concerned that marine mammals would not be detectable
from the air, making the incidental take tables suspect.

 in order to determine the parameters for physical harassment. Physical harassment of cetaceans due to tactile ``stings''
from the shockwave accompanying detonations has been inferred from studies with humans. This inference seems plausible
given studies on dolphin skin sensitivity where the authors

 concluded that ``the most sensitive areas of the dolphin skin (mouth, eyes, snout, melon and blowhole) are about as
sensitive as the skin of human lips and fingers.'' Skin sensitivity on pinnipeds and large whales has not been tested.
Therefore, until tests can be conducted to determine the overall sensitivity of the skin of marine mammals, NMFS and
the Navy have made the assumption that both humans and marine mammals have similar tactile sensitivity in the water.

In another rulemaking, NMFS has proposed a new definition of ``harass'' (58 FR 53320, October 14, 1993) at 50 CFR 216.3.
Harass is proposed to mean, under the definition of ``take'' in the MMPA, ``an intentional or negligent act or omission
that results in, an injury to a marine mammal, a disruption in the behavior that a marine mammal was exhibiting prior
to the act or omission, or a significant effect on the normal behavioral patterns of a marine mammal, including, but
not limited to, breeding, feeding, sheltering, or migration patterns.'' This definition, if implemented in that
rulemaking, will apply also to these small take regulations.

As stated in the application, for reasons of safety, aircraft cannot be airborne at the time of detonation and will
need to leave the area approximately 3 minutes prior to detonation. Therefore, ``avoidance behavior'' by marine
mammals, unfortunately, will not be directly observable from the air. Harassment takes will be calculated indirectly
as those animals detected within the 3-nm post-test search zone, but outside the area wherein the test is considered
to have resulted in death or injury.

NMFS and the Navy recognize that some marine mammal species will be difficult to detect from the air and that some injurious
and/or lethal takes may occur even with the mitigative measures being implemented to reduce takes. The ability of
aerial observers to detect these species has been taken into account when calculating incidental take levels (refer
to Table 14 and accompanying text in the EA; also see ``Mitigation'' responses below).

Marine mammal scientists will categorize marine mammals detected within a search area of approximately 3-nm radius
of a 10,000-lb charge detonation according to whether they are: (1) deceased, or severely injured and likely to die;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``injured'' but not likely to die; and (3) harassed. If the marine mammal is believed to have been within approximately
1 nm of the test site at the time of detonation, it will be listed as either dead or seriously injured; ``injured, but
not seriously, if outside 1 nm but within approximately 13/4 nm, and ``harassed'' if outside 13/4 nm but within the
3-nm search area. NMFS notes that counting all marine mammals observed within 3 nm of a test site should account for
all incidental takes, since outside the monitoring area, the 160 dB level for the onset of harassment takes will be
found only at a significant depth. The LOA will specify the conditions for categorizing marine mammals, and, among
other things, the size of the safety zone for each detonation weight. The final rule has been written to clarify terms.

One commenter noted that provision is made in the proposed regulations for altering the test procedure if marine mammal
fatalities or injuries are detected. The commenter feels that if the consensus among marine biologists is that harassment
occurs beyond the bounds of the safety zone *&blank;*&blank;*, this should also be justification for altering the
test procedure.

Theoretically, physical and acoustic harassment may occur outside the 2-nm safety zone (refer to the Navy application
for information). However, because of shot geometries, the amount of ``safe water'' at the water surface is closer
to the detonation point than the perimeter of the safety zone. For this reason, NMFS believes that the 3-nm post-test
survey zone will include all marine mammals ``harassed'' by the shot. NMFS will continue to monitor ship shock tests
to determine whether modifications to the procedure, the regulations or the monitoring program will result in a decrease
in marine mammal take, including takes by harassment.

One commenter noted that the application presents test data versus model predictions for lung injury (Table 7) and
because marine mammals vary greatly in size and volume of air spaces, fat content, and other things, fixed models are
problematic in describing lethal or injurious effects to marine mammals.

Absent data from experimental testing on live marine mammals (or other proxy animals) for the larger explosive charges,
the model predictions are the best scientific data available and have been used by NMFS and the Navy for their calculations
of incidental take. However, it should be noted that figures 11 through 15 in the application show the calculated range
for the onset of slight lung injury as a function of both the marine mammal weight and the explosive charge weight. Figure
11 shows that the larger the mammal, the closer to the detonation site the animal needed to be in order to incur injury.
The Navy used a marine mammal weighing 110 lb (50 kilograms (kg)) to calculate the safety range necessary to preclude
injury to marine mammals.

The low frequency (below 300 Hz) of the detonation acoustic signal has been determined as being too low to harass any
odontocetes (i.e., toothed whales). The commenter stated that only limited data are available on the effect of low
frequency sound on odontocetes, and because the data available are for one or two species (to the commenter's knowledge),
can NMFS therefore make such a sweeping assumption?

The best scientific information available indicates that odontocete cetaceans cannot hear well in the frequencies
emitted by the explosive detonation. Additional evidence indicates that they also may not be able to hear the pulse
generated from underwater detonations of even the largest charges because it is very brief (ca. 0.05 sec). However,
because odontocetes and pinnipeds are considered to be ``taken'' by physical harassment already, whether they also
hear (and are thereby acoustically harassed) the explosion would not add significantly to the take estimates.

The number of Navy vessels and aircraft that would be involved in the exercise will depend upon their specific requirements
for the ship shock trial. The effect of these vessels on marine life, including marine mammals, would be expected to
be negligible and likely no more intrusive than that caused by commercial and other vessels using the nearby Route
2 ship traffic lane into Los Angeles/Long Beach (approximately 4.6 percent of the approximately 19,800 round trips
annually by non-commercial fishing marine vessels into Los Angeles/Long Beach use Route 2).

There may be some inadvertent harassment of marine mammals by marine mammal surveillance aircraft during the various
surveys for mammal-free areas for the detonation site. However, because these search efforts are under the direction
and control of NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) and are for the purpose of avoiding injury or death
to marine mammals, this activity is being covered under their scientific research permit (Permit Number 873; P77

50). In addition, there might be some harassment takes during the post-survey monitoring and recovery efforts. This
latter program is authorized by the regulations (50 CFR 228.55(d)(2)) and does not require a separate permit under

One commenter wanted the Navy to recalculate its incidental take request by using the upper 95th percentile of the
population abundance estimates instead of the mean of those estimates. This, the commenter believes, would avoid
the possibility of the Navy exceeding its authorized take limits and needing to cease operations in order to request
the additional takes.

Such an amendment to the Navy's application would inordinately delay the scheduled ship shock trial. In addition,
because of the very conservative approach to estimating the number of incidental takes, it is considered extremely
unlikely that explosives detonations in the OSTR will result in incidental take levels approaching the requested
level.

NMFS uses both the MMPA and the ESA standard of ``the best available scientific and commercial data'' to determine
the impacts of activities on marine mammals. Although NMFS would like to have more baseline data on marine mammals
within the SCB and more information on the effects of large-charge detonations on marine life, in particular on marine
mammals, NMFS based its decision on the best information available, including NMFS marine mammal assessment surveys
conducted in 1991 and 1992 and Defense Department research on the effects of explosions on marine life. NMFS is not
aware of any more recent scientific evidence that would be contrary to its findings and two commenters did not provide
citations or references to any new information. Also, without knowledge of scientific evidence contrary to research
used in its determination, NMFS is confident that it used the best scientific and commercial data available in making
its determination. However, monitoring is a requirement of the regulations and for a continuation of the LOA. The
results from the monitoring will be used to verify (or refute) the findings made by NMFS, and if new evidence or data
indicate that the impact on marine mammals is more than negligible, NMFS will reassess its findings and take appropriate
action as mandated by section 101(a)(5)(B)(ii) of the MMPA.

The EA, upon which the proposed regulations rely, fails to meet the standards mandated by the MMPA because NMFS failed
not only in obtaining the best scientific evidence available, but failed in using even the limited evidence available
as a basis for a reasoned conclusion. For instance, the Navy has indicated to NMFS that tests will not be conducted if
marine mammals are detected within the testing zone *&blank;*&blank;* and NMFS concluded *&blank;*&blank;* that
such efforts will minimize impacts to marine mammals, despite knowing that many marine mammals will not be visible
by aerial survey. The commenter continues that the Navy, given its years of experience under the seas, should be able
to detect marine mammals.

NMFS used the best scientific information available in making its assessments and determinations (see previous
response). As stated in the EA, the evidence indicates that some marine mammal species may not be observed by aerial
surveillance during pre-test overflights (because they are submerged at the time). Since detonation of the explosive
charge will not take place if even a single marine mammal (or sea turtle, fish school or seabird flock) is observed within
the safety zone, it is the possibility that some marine mammals would be missed during pre-test surveys which makes
a small take authorization necessary. The scientific basis for assessing the likelihood of marine mammals being
taken was fully discussed and documented in both the EA and the Navy application.

NMFS shares the concern of the commenter, but obviously, conducting tests on the effects of explosives on live marine
mammals would be controversial and an authorization may be difficult for a scientific research applicant to obtain
under the MMPA. For that reason, the Navy bases its impact assessments on theoretical calculations, supported by
test data using small charges on alternative test animals. NMFS will closely monitor ship shock tests and review the
reports required under these regulations and the LOA to determine whether the basis for the finding of negligible
impact continues to exist. If a negligible finding can no longer be made, NMFS is required under sections 101(a)(5)
(B) and (C) of the MMPA to withdraw or suspend the authorization to take marine mammals.

Several commenters criticized the survey effort claiming that some experts consider 800 ft (266 m) to be too high for
aerial surveys to observe marine mammals and that vessel surveys are potentially an unnecessary use of funds. One
commenter wants to see the survey effort placed in context with the surrounding area.

The aerial and vessel surveys were conducted by NMFS as part of its marine mammal assessment program under section
114 of the MMPA. Since these surveys were for the entire California coast and not restricted to the SCB, they were ``in
context.'' The data from these surveys were used by the Navy in its application. The survey design methodology uses
an aircraft height of 700 to 800 ft (233 to 266 m) which is the height commonly used for marine mammal surveys.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Without evidence to the contrary, NMFS continues to believe that a height of 700 to 800 ft (233 to 266 m) is appropriate,
as lower altitudes may result in missed animals due to the reduced time for observation from being closer to the water
(higher ground speed). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveys to determine areas of low marine mammal abundance and pre- and post-detonation surveys do not need to extend

One commenter considered NMFS' determination of impacts upon affected species to be ``arbitrary and capricious''
because NMFS ``admitted'' that the density of many species is unknown. Another believed the impact of the action is
unknown because the density of the species in the area is unknown. The first commenter also stated that density studies
are necessary before NMFS may proceed.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is unclear how these commenters arrived at this conclusion, as Table 14 in the EA gives the calculated density for
each species in the SCB. Population estimates for the SCB were made from aerial and vessel surveys of the California
coast in 1991 and 1992. Additional surveys were conducted in 1993 in the SCB and are currently being analyzed. However,
marine mammal density is not static, it can vary due to school size, environmental conditions, migratory patterns
and food source distribution, making it difficult to predict where in space or time an individual or a group of animals
will occur. For those reasons, when calculating the number of animals expected in the test range, an assumption is
made that distribution is uniform, which it is not. This has been discussed previously in a related comment under ``Incidental
Take'' above. (Also, refer to similar comment under ``National Environmental Policy Act Concerns'' below). The
assumptions specific to each marine mammal group is given in the EA.

Aerial and ship marine mammal surveys, upon which incidental take estimates are based, were conducted in 1991 and
1992. Additional survey work to determine areas of low marine mammal abundance for the ship shock tests were conducted
during 1993. Distribution and abundance estimates from these studies, in general, agree with previous studies,
with some exceptions, which were noted and fully discussed in the EA.

NMFS believes the mitigation measures required by the rule are adequate to protect marine mammals and reduce incidental
take to the lowest level practicable. While aerial surveys will have difficulty detecting those marine mammal species
that spend a significant portion of the time submerged, the regulations prohibit detonations if even a single marine
mammal (or sea turtle, sea bird flock or fish school) is sighted within the safety zone by aerial survey. The small take
authorization is for the unintentional take of marine mammals not sighted by aerial survey. Refer to the EA for a detailed

Some commenters suggested additional (or alternative) methods for detecting marine mammals during surveys, especially
for deep-diving species, such as sonobuoys and hydrophone arrays. One commenter also suggested, if possible, using
sound to cause some species to surface so they can be seen or to leave or avoid the test area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Navy proposes to employ hydrophone arrays at several locations to record the impulse pressure wave resulting
from the ship shock trial, these hydrophones will not be capable of recording marine mammal vocalizations. Also,
because the shock trial is a mobile exercise, and because it would be necessary to triangulate on vocalizing marine
mammals in order to determine whether or not they are within the vicinity of the shock trial, this suggestion is not
viewed as being practicable at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practicality of using ``scare charges'' (smaller explosive charges) or high decibel noise devices in order to
scare marine mammals from the area of testing is equivocal at best. There is insufficient evidence to give assurance
that marine mammals would leave the area and not be attracted to the site.

distances greater than 2 nm. The commenter also considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Area 1'' and ``Area 2'' to be artificial and anthropocentric. Other commenters were concerned that the effects
could extend to great distances, for example physical harassment could occur 22,000 ft (6,706 m) from the detonation
and acoustic harassment up to 121,000 ft (37,039 m) for a 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) charge. One commenter was concerned
that these distances would cause an impact very close to the nearest islands.

NMFS considers the 2-nm safety zone to be adequate to protect marine mammals from injury and death. As indicated in
the EA (Table 12) for the 10,000-lb (4,536 kg) charge, the 2-nm (i.e., 12,150-ft (3,704 m)) safety zone is greater than
the calculated limit for minimum eardrum injury (9,400 ft (2,865 m)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in Table 12, while physical harassment could occur up to 22,000 ft (4.2 nm) from the detonation, as indicated
in the application, the safety zone exceeds the maximum horizontal ranges for physical harassment for mammals at
the shallow depths; however, for mammals at depths greater than 200 ft (67 m), there is a possibility for physical harassment
beyond the safety zones, since the surface reflected relief wave arrives later at these depths for these ranges. Refer
to the application for a detailed description of sound source levels in the marine environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For acoustic harassment, based upon the best available information, pinnipeds and odontocetes are unlikely to be
subjected to acoustic harassment due to the very low frequency and extreme brevity of the sound associated with detonations.
For mysticetes, the range for the 160 dB re 1 uPa (the level above which avoidance behavior is believed to occur) increases
from 86,000 ft (14.2 nm) at a water depth of 50 ft (15 m) to 121,520 ft (20 nm) at a depth of 1,000 ft (305 m). Therefore, while
some mysticete cetaceans may be acoustically harassed if at these depths, it is unlikely that any impacts will accrue
to the coastal zone of the SCB because of the distance from the detonation site, the shallow depths of the coastal zone
and the masking effect of ambient noise (

One commenter was concerned because there was no method indicated that would assess the extent and/or severity of
acoustic (and other) injury incurred by marine mammals in the test area. The commenter states that these types of injury
would be very difficult to assess from aerial or shipboard reconnaissance. For many of the mammals that would be affected,
acoustic injury could have a profound impact on their ability to navigate and on their ability to interact with other
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the possibility that acoustic injury could have significant impact, the commenter believes that there
should be a more comprehensive plan for assessing the extent of acoustic injury and its impact on marine life as a result
of this project.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While generally agreeing with the comment, NMFS disagrees that a more comprehensive plan is necessary. Three types
of injuries have been identified for marine mammals from ship shock trials. These are: (1) Lung injuries; (2) gastro
intestinal injuries; and (3) eardrum (rupture) injuries. As determining the type and extent of these injuries would
require capturing and either sacrificing the animal or subjecting the animal to long-term captive observation,
and as both of these are unacceptable to NMFS unless the animal requires euthanization or immediate veterinary care,
the Navy and NMFS will utilize less intrusive methods for determining incidental takes, including, but not necessarily
limited to, photo-identifying ``injured'' marine mammals, and necropsies on stranded and other dead marine mammals
to determine the probable cause of death and its relationship if any, to the trial. However, because even minimal eardrum

Commenters were concerned that the post-test surveys would not be able to detect all marine mammals (and fish) that
are killed or seriously injured during ship shock trials, because animals might sink and not rise immediately to the
surface. One commenter suggested post-detonation surveys continue for up to 1 week after the trial to search for these
animals and to assess oceanographic current patterns to determine search effort. One commenter recommended that
monitoring should be conducted over the long-term to document whether there is a chronic effect from the ship shock
trials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS agrees with these concerns, noting that a ship shock trial is a series of one to six (usually four) charges set off
approximately one week apart. Therefore, a project and its monitoring program are likely to continue for up to six
weeks between the first and last detonations. As explained in detail in the application (refer particularly to Figure
31), post-detonation surveys will begin approximately 30 minutes after each detonation. The survey effort will
be repeated for each scheduled test until the shock trial is completed. The 48-hour advance pre-detonation marine
mammal search survey will also serve as a final post-test follow-up survey for the previous test. A post-trial follow-up
survey will be conducted approximately 1 week after the last test of the shock trial. In addition, the Marine Animal
Recovery Team (MART) will be required to make every effort to document and examine those injured or dead marine mammals
(if any) that are moved outside the test area by currents subsequent to a detonation. Finally, NMFS will monitor the
stranding records for evidence that the ship shock trials are having more than a negligible impact on the marine mammal
species and stocks in the SCB. The monitoring requirements for marine mammals will be specified in the LOA.

Although deceased marine mammals that sink will return to the surface within a few days of the detonation, it is unlikely
that subsurface fish species would be detectable during post-test monitoring and would likely be consumed by predators
before surfacing. Sea turtles will also be difficult to detect once they sink.

As the NMFS and the Navy expect few marine mammals to be killed during ship shock trials, each lethal take will be reviewed
by NMFS scientists, MART personnel and the U.S. Navy to determine whether similar takes can be prevented in future
tests. However, until ship shock tests take place and incidental lethal takes are documented, the actions NMFS and
the Navy will take to reduce potential future lethal takes cannot be determined.

NMFS believes that this recommendation is neither practical nor warranted. The ship shock test is a complicated combat
simulation that requires the participation of several Navy aircraft and ships. Therefore, the Navy cannot be prohibited
from the test area, although it will likely have moved away from the detonation site by the time the post-test monitoring
begins. Moreover, it is not entirely clear from the comment the purpose behind the requested prohibition, since the
Navy will have an authorization for incidentally taking marine mammals during the exercise.

The preamble to the proposed rule noted that NMFS will be consulting with the Navy under section 7 of the ESA. The Navy
is required to consult under section 7, and it generally is NMFS policy that formal consultation should be initiated
at the earliest opportunity, in this case, since NMFS would be conducting formal consultation with both the Navy and
itself (because the proposed issuance of a small take authorization is a Federal action), consultation was not initiated
until after the proposed rule was issued on October 15, 1993. That consultation has been completed. A copy of NMFS'
Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement is available upon request (see

Since NMFS must analyze a request for a small take authorization to determine whether the proposed marine mammal taking
has only a negligible impact on species or stocks of marine mammals and does not have an unmitigable adverse impact
on the availability for subsistence uses, NMFS assessed many of the potential environmental impacts that are also
assessed under NEPA. Through this process, and during preparation of an EA, NMFS determined that the proposed activity
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
issuance of regulations and an LOA) will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and made a ``finding
of no significant impact.'' If an EA results in this finding, no additional documents are required by NEPA. The detonation
of the explosives by itself does not necessarily invoke a ``significant'' impact finding. However, the Navy must
also satisfy NEPA prior to undertaking any action that might impact the human environment.

The following 8 comments relate specifically to NEPA concerns raised by one or two commenters (but may also have been
mentioned by others). One of these commenters submitted detailed comments to support its position that the proposed
action will have a ``significant'' impact under NEPA and therefore requires a DEIS. However, NMFS does not concur
with the commenter's interpretation that CEQ regulations state that certain factors (which follow and are evaluated
below) are ``critical'' for making a determination relating to the ``intensity'' of the action. CEQ regulations
(40 CFR 1508.27) require these factors ``to be considered'' in evaluating the intensity of the proposed action. As
discussed below, these factors were given consideration by NMFS.

According to the Navy, ship shock testing, while possibly having a short-term impact on the marine environment, also
has a beneficial impact in ensuring the health and safety of seamen onboard the Nation's naval vessels. In its EA, NMFS
found that the proposed activity (

Comment:

The EA fails to address the degree to which the proposed action affects the public health and welfare. The commenter
was concerned that, because a variety of potentially harmful compounds from the explosive could persist in surface
pools for 30&hyph;60 minutes after detonation, this could result in subtle and long-term effects on marine mammals
and birds (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS disagrees. First, as stated in the EA (page 47), and as provided for under CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.21), NMFS
has incorporated by reference the Navy EA written in 1990
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. While identifying that document more clearly on that page may have improved the EA, the Navy EA was cited in the references.
That document described in some detail the potential impacts on the human environment from explosives detonation.
NMFS incorporated this information by reference but did not include discussion in its EA, that part of the Navy EA that
discussed impacts on humans, because NMFS was of the opinion that the proposed small take authorization would not
have an impact on public health or safety, and was therefore not relevant. However, because NMFS' proposed action
may affect the environment that marine mammals inhabit, NMFS' EA does note that while 100 percent of the solid material
and approximately 10 percent of the gases would be contained in the water pool created by the explosion (an area 10.8
X 107 ft3 (3.06 X 106 m3) for the 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) charge), the concentrations shown are below the levels considered
harmful for fish and would not be expected to pose a threat to marine mammals after the stabilization times (53 minutes
for 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) charge). The commenter's concern however, is apparently on the impact to marine mammals and
other marine life entering the surface pool before stabilization (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
less than 53 minutes after detonation). Assuming these marine mammals were not within the 2-nm safety zone at the time
of detonation, NMFS believes that the likelihood of this occurring is remote and if it happens there will be little
or no effect, either singly or cumulatively, from the chemical components of the surface pool. As noted in the Navy
EA, the chemical components (primarily composed of gases) would be thoroughly dispersed, with no possible buildup
or cumulative effect, and become indistinguishable from other trace level constituents of the ocean shortly after
detonation. The only solid particles are carbon and aluminum oxide. Carbon particles will tend to float on the surface
and move with the pool while aluminum oxide particles, a naturally occurring component of seawater due to the weathering
of rock, will probably settle to the bottom over a large area.

While the SCB can be considered an ecologically important area that contains ``unique characteristics'' including
the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary, because the area surrounding the detonation site will be in an area of low marine
mammal abundance (and presumably other marine life); off the continental shelf (on or near the Patton Escarpment);
approximately 50 nm from the nearest boundary of the sanctuary; and, although in productive waters, not in a major
upwelling (nutrient-rich) or commercial fishing area, NMFS believes that the small take authorization will not
have an impact on the SCB and its resources (including the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary) significant
enough to require a DEIS.

 As required by CEQ regulations, NMFS considered ``the degree to which the effects (of the proposed action) on the quality
of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial'' as a factor in determining whether the intensity
of the proposed action would make it ``significant.'' Because NMFS' review of the best available scientific information
led to the conclusion in the EA that the proposed detonations will have a negligible impact on marine mammals and other
marine resources, the fact that the commenters did not provide any new or contradictory scientific information regarding
such impacts reaffirms NMFS' conclusion that there is no real scientifically-based controversy about the effects
of the proposed action sufficient to change NMFS' conclusion that the proposed action would not have a significant
impact on the human environment such that preparation of a DEIS would be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Navy's ship shock testing may be opposed by many members of the public, much of that objection is due to philosophical
differences of opinion rather than objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically- or factually-based controversy over what will be the effects of such testing on the environment.
NMFS believes that the rulemaking shows that the issuance of a small take authorization to the Navy would not have effects
(intensity) that are ``highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks'' significant enough to require a DEIS.
In the EA and in the Navy's small take application, the level of scientific uncertainty has been substantially lessened
by incorporating scientifically acceptable environmental prediction methods as necessary. In addition, mitigation
and monitoring measures incorporated into the LOA and regulations substantially moderate potential impacts from
ship shock testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter states that ``among those who are criticizing the proposed detonations are knowledgeable scientists
with years of experience studying affected species.'' However, other than those scientists submitting comments
that have been addressed in this section, because independent scientists neither submitted significant comments
addressing the science upon which the small take authorization is based when information was requested during the
June 1993 comment period, nor as a result of the EA and proposed rule, NMFS is unaware of either the reasons for their
purported criticism or contrary scientific evidence to support their position.

: The same commenter, noted that by granting the Navy's permit application, NMFS will establish a (dangerous) precedent
for future action with significant effects. The commenter was concerned that future applications would require
no more than was done for this application even though mitigation efforts are highly questionable as to effectiveness
and that there would be no incentive for the Navy to develop more accurate detection methods (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(6)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: NMFS disagrees with this assessment. The mitigation measures (survey for low animal abundance areas, aerial surveys,
go/no-go determination, post-detonation surveys etc.) required under these regulations are considered adequate
to detect marine mammals and other marine life and limit incidental takings to the lowest possible number. In addition,
the ship shock test small take authorization will be reviewed at least annually to make a determination that the taking
continues to comply with section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA. While the mitigation measures in these regulations may seem
``questionable'' to some commenters, practical alternative methods for detecting marine mammals have not been
recommended (see response under ``Mitigation''). Moreover, future Navy applications for a small take authorization
under the MMPA will be judged on the adequacy of the documentation submitted, not on previous actions, such as this
one.

Certain impacts, while insignificant individually, are significant when considered cumulatively (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(7)).

NMFS did not review the proposed action as a 1-year authorization; it reviewed it as a 5-year authorization period,
and therefore evaluated the cumulative impacts of the proposed activity over 5 years. As stated in the EA, the cumulative
impact on marine mammals from ship shock tests over the 5-year authorization period of the regulations will be negligible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, ship shock testing (in combination with other military explosives detonation projects) would not have a significant
impact, either singly or cumulatively, on the marine environment of the SCB over the 5-year authorization period.
The infrequency of the large-charge tests and the minimal impact of the small charges are two additional reasons for
this determination.

NMFS does not concur. While ship shock testing may result in the non-lethal injury or harassment of endangered marine
mammals, this level of incidental take will not result in the mortality of listed marine mammals or result in jeopardizing
the continued existence of these species. (Refer to the Biological Opinion for additional information). The estimated
numbers of incidental takes are given and assessed in the EA. Although sperm whales, because of their abundance and
deep-diving behavior, may be subject to a ``high incidental take,'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
six non-lethal injuries and 20 harassment takes if they are in the area on each and every test) there will not be a ``high
incidental killing'' of sperm whales as the commenter states. With a California population size of 857 and a North
Pacific population size of 930,000, these takes are considered ``small'' and will not be a significant impact on the
stock. Moreover, the OSTR has not been designated ``critical habitat'' for any listed species. Individual injured
animals would be expected to recover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is less information available on sea turtles in the SCB than marine mammals, as discussed in the EA. Due to the
less effective ability of aerial overflights to detect some species of sea turtles, the Navy admits that some sea turtles
may be injured or possibly killed during explosives detonation. However, based upon mortalities observed in other
tests in an area of presumably higher sea turtle abundance than the SCB, and because recent research (cited in the EA)
indicates that sea turtles are less susceptible to injury from explosives than marine mammals, few sea turtles are
likely to be killed or seriously injured. Although post-test monitoring efforts may not be totally effective in determining
impacts to sea turtles, the monitoring program will try to determine whether sea turtles are in fact incidentally
killed and, if so, whether practical modifications are available to improve detection and/or to reduce impacts.
Also, because of the great depth of the water at the test location, several species, such as coastal inhabiting, bottom-feeding
and coral-feeding species, would be expected to be uncommon or rarely seen in the area. (Contrary to one commenter's
observation, even though sea turtle species are listed as endangered or threatened, some species are sufficiently
abundant in certain areas and times to be considered more than ``rare,'' (

area.'' This same commenter and another commenter stated that ``NEPA and the MMPA require public participation and
hearings.'' One commenter also noted that ``the marine scientific community should have provided a greater role
in assessing the impacts of the proposed action.'' Another listed the names of several scientists, who were unaware
of the public hearings or that the Navy proposed to begin ship shock trials in February 1994.

southern California newspapers. A press release noting the proposed rule and the meeting times and locations was
also issued. NMFS believes that it has complied with both the spirit and the letter of NEPA, NOAA Directives implementing

The location for the Long Beach public meeting was chosen because it was considered central to the affected area (i.e.,
the SCB). Those unable to attend the meeting were invited to submit written comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible for NMFS to have advance knowledge of all individuals interested in its activities, although it
is noted that none of the individuals listed in one commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 8, 1993, testimony contacted NMFS to obtain the documentation for review or submitted comments after being
informed by the commenter of the proposed action. In addition, at least one of these individuals received a copy of
the Navy application in June. The marine scientific community has had sufficient opportunity to become involved
in this process.

Many commenters believe that NMFS should have made more of an effort to locate alternative sites as required by NEPA.
One commenter believed that NMFS must evaluate the proposed site in concert with other possible sites. One commenter
asserts that NMFS has not considered previously used sites. Another commenter believed that the MMPA required NMFS
to evaluate alternate sites to ensure the least practicable adverse impact upon affected species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the EA was to evaluate the impact of the proposed issuance of a small take authorization to the Navy to
incidentally take marine mammals within the OSTR. Under that Federal action, NMFS identified two alternatives,
in addition to the proposal. The alternatives to the proposal were to issue the LOA without mitigation requirements
and to not issue a small take authorization, the no action alternative. Alternatives such as alternative sites or
methods were identified as being beyond the scope of the proposed action. Because NMFS is not authorizing the detonation
of explosives, only the proposed taking of marine mammals incidental to such detonations, NMFS is of the opinion that
the site determination and method of operation is the responsibility of the Navy (provided NMFS is assured that there
was not a practicable alternative to ship shock testing that would result in not taking marine mammals). As stated
in the EA, if a Small Take LOA is not given to the Navy (no action alternative), because the take was either not small or
would result in more than a negligible impact to the species, then the Navy could elect to relocate the test site or take
some other action. Refer to the response under the ``Outer Sea Test Range'' below for additional discussion on this
topic.

The Navy will be utilizing survey data collected in 1993 to limit the test site within the OSTR to an area with few or no
marine mammals. Current aerial survey data will be used to ``reduce'' the test area to a site that will minimize potential
impacts to marine mammals. Arbitrarily limiting the test area to a particular corner or area of the OSTR at this stage
would be premature, and may not result in reduced impacts to marine mammals and other marine life.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS should consider such alternatives such as a reduction in the number of detonations; the sizes of detonations;
and, the period in which detonations are allowed. Additionally, NMFS must give due consideration to alternative
forms of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the Navy's application, the estimated number of large detonations is extremely conservative, and based
on an extreme worst case scenario. To ensure conservatism, the Navy multiplied its worst case scenario by 5 (years)
to determine the absolute maximum take during the 5-year term of the LOA. It is highly unlikely that the Navy will detonate
60 large charges during the 5-year period. However, there is justification, although remote, for requiring up to
12 detonations on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four shots of gradually increasing severity maximizes safety, technical benefits, and economics. Small increases
in severity between shots raises confidence in predicting the potential for unforeseen hazards from one shot to the
next. Experience, careful planning, and examination of objectives and constraints resolved that 4 shots is the optimum
procedure for conducting a shock trial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a ship the size of an AEGIS-class destroyer, a 10,000 lb. (4,536 kg) charge is necessary to produce a nearly planar
shock wave. A plane wave generates nearly uniform loading on each shot, which is required when measuring responses
from thousands of reaction points around the ship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time there is no scientific evidence to indicate that there is any one period of the year when marine mammals
are not within the OSTR. Population assessment research in the SCB will be reviewed to determine if seasonal restrictions
would result in lower incidental takes. If so, then NMFS would likely take actions necessary to ensure the greatest
protection to these marine mammals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where feasible, the Navy conducts underwater explosives tests using computer modeling and land-based test facilities.
Two contractor-operated quarries in Virginia are used for some of the test work. In addition, a test pond has been constructed
at the Army Combat Systems Test Activity in Aberdeen, MD. These facilities are limited to testing small and medium
size components on floating platforms. Ponds, like those at Aberdeen and in Virginia reduce the need for testing in
the ocean. It is impossible, however, to eliminate the need for open-water testing for programs such as full-scale
ship shock trials.

One commenter believed that it would be ``better and wiser to wait, if at all possible, until the [computer-model]
technology is perfected than to gamble so much on the current imperfections of the [ship shock trial] technology.''

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the EA, the ``no action'' alternative is unacceptable to the Navy as the ``Live Fire'' testing program
is required by the National Defense Authorization Act (10 U.S.C. 139). By law, ships and critical components or systems
constructed for the Navy must undergo shock tests prior to service with the fleet to determine the integrity of the
structure and electronic systems that are vital to the overall function and performance of the vessel and crew under
wartime combat conditions. While full-scale testing is minimized by the use of laboratory tests and calculations,
the Navy believes that it is essential to have large-scale tests at sea to determine total system response. The alternative
of not testing at all would expose the ship and its crew to its first real test under hostile fire. It is the Navy's judgement
that this is not the appropriate time nor place to determine that a component or system fails a test. While alternatives
are theoretically possible, they have not been developed to the point of practical application.

There is no evidence that the offshore SCB area is an especially important area for feeding, although it is known that
some of the larger whales tend to prefer the Patton Escarpment area and may migrate along it. NMFS review of the best
available scientific information indicates that impacts on food sources and migratory routes however, would be
minimal and would not result in a long-term impact.

Several commenters were concerned about the potential for taking California sea otters and that the Navy has not applied
to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for an incidental take authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the EA accompanying the proposed rule, an incidental take of sea otters has not been requested because sea
otters are coastal animals found north of San Luis Obispo, CA, that prefer to remain within a few kilometers of the coast.
Those sea otters inhabiting San Nicolas Island as a result of the USFWS' translocation efforts are unlikely to be within
the OSTR. The Navy will be consulting with USFWS on their activity under section 7 of the ESA.

via aerial surveys and that most gray whales (78 percent of cow-calf pairs and 94 percent of all other whales) were within
3 nm (5.6 km) of the islands. Animals classified by researchers as ``calves of the season'' comprised nearly 12 percent
of the raw counts. Ninety-four percent of the cow-calf pairs were seen east of Santa Rosa Island. It should also be noted
that pregnant gray whales are in the vanguard of the south-bound migration and, because they give birth from January
to mid-February in and near the lagoons in Baja California, should have migrated south through the SCB by February,
the time of the proposed testing.

Response:

The Navy made a determination not to request an incidental take authorization for Guadalupe fur seals and Steller
sea lions because their population sizes in the SCB (one to five fur seals and 100 sea lions) were low and that mitigation
measures would likely detect these species if an individual was there. In the event a Guadalupe fur seal or a Steller
sea lion is taken, such taking would be in violation of the MMPA (and the LOA). Alternatively, if one is seen in the area
prior to the test but not taken because the test is delayed until the animal leaves, then the Navy may elect to request
an amendment to its LOA and the authorizing regulations for future tests.

The EA listed the criteria that the Navy established for locating ship shock trials. Refer to that document for a list
of these criteria. However, it should be recognized that the Pacific Missile Range is an oceanic area designated for
military activities since it was established by the Department of Defense in 1946. According to the Navy, the OSTR
has been used for ship shock trials since 1990. The only other West Coast site where ship shock trials of this magnitude
have been conducted is within a military operations area east of San Clemente Island. However, since 1990, environmental
concerns and the large number of fleet operations (greater than 200,000 per year), preclude the use of this area for
ship shock trials. Thus, this alternative was eliminated from further consideration by the Navy. For a discussion
on utilizing portions of the OSTR, refer to similar concerns under ``National Environmental Policy Act Concerns''
above and ``Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Concerns'' below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the San Juan Seamount is approximately 12 nm west of the western boundary of the OSTR. Because
the 2-nm safety zone will be within the OSTR, at a minimum, the test site will be 14 nm from the eastern slope of the seamount.
The Navy believes, and NMFS concurs, that there will be little or no impact on the resources of the seamount.

For the ship shock trials, the explosive is not allowed to free fall through the water column but is towed to the site,
armed, buoyed at the appropriate depth (125 ft (38 m) or 200 ft (61 m) depending upon the charge weight) and detonated.
Unexploded ordnance is towed to a deep-water site for safe disposal.

Many reviewers commented on the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the impacts that they believe the ship
shock testing will have on the marine life within the sanctuary. One commenter stated that the contiguous line drawn
between the two territorial sea limits was only 6 miles (9.6 km) from the sanctuary at Santa Barbara. This commenter
believed the shock tests could have a negative effect on the marine mammals and seabirds that inhabit the Sanctuary.
The commenter goes on to state that both noise and concussions generated from the test could, at the least, startle
and disrupt pinnipeds, cetaceans and seabirds within the Sanctuary, and at the worst, the concussions could injure
or kill these creatures. This commenter recommended that NMFS require the Navy to conduct ship shock trials south
of latitude 33
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

Response:

There is no evidence that ship shock tests, conducted within the OSTR will impact the resources of the Channel Islands
National Marine Sanctuary, and commenters have not offered contrary documentation (refer to related comment under
``Mitigation and Monitoring'' above). While the actual ship shock test site will likely be upwards of 50 nm from the
outer boundary of the Sanctuary (in the southwestern portion of the OSTR), the northeastern boundary of the OSTR is
located no closer than 6 nm (11.1 km) from the outer perimeter of the Sanctuary, a distance greater than calculated
for onset of all types of take except acoustic harassment at significant water depths. As mentioned previously, the
Navy will be utilizing NMFS' 1993 marine mammal survey data to limit the test site within the OSTR to an area with few
or no marine mammals. This current aerial survey data will be used to ``reduce'' the test area to a site that will minimize
potential impacts to marine mammals. Arbitrarily limiting the test area to a particular area of the OSTR at this stage
would be premature, and may not result in reduced impacts to marine mammals and other marine life.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations and LOA authorizing the incidental taking require the Navy to allow NMFS personnel onboard vessels
and aircraft during ship shock trials and other operations using explosives within the OSTR. NMFS authority does
not extend to requiring the Navy to be subject to an oversight committee of citizens. The comment has been forwarded
to the Navy for consideration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asserted that if the LOA is issued, ``a financial bonus will accrue to the Southwest Fisheries Science
Center in La Jolla. This represents a clear conflict of interest on the part of NMFS. The appearance of a conflict could
have been mitigated had other entities with marine mammal monitoring experience been requested to bid; that would
also have resulted in the lowest cost estimate by SWFSC, which had no incentive to trim its cost estimate and which will
have no incentive to limit actual costs to an amount less than the estimated costs.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS does not concur with this assessment. The Navy, in 1992, made preliminary inquiries regarding the cost of conducting
marine mammal surveys with private entities experienced in marine mammal surveys, in addition to the NMFS' SWFSC.
The Navy independently determined that NMFS would be able to conduct the surveys at approximately one-third the cost
of the other groups contacted. With that determination made, the Navy made an inter-agency transfer of funds to NMFS
to conduct the surveys and post-test monitoring. The SWFSC proposal was included in the application of the Navy for
a small take authorization and available therefor for review and comment at that time. No comments were received on
the proposal.

Description of Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subject regulations govern the incidental taking of marine mammals during the detonation of conventional explosives
in the OSTR off Pt. Mugu, CA. The regulations are based on the entire rulemaking record including evidence submitted
in an application from the Navy that the detonation of conventional explosives off the Channel Islands, CA, over the
next 5 years may involve the incidental taking (harassment, injury or death) of marine mammals. NMFS has determined
that the total taking will involve small numbers of marine mammals and will have a negligible impact on the species
for which the take is requested, their habitat, and the availability of these species for subsistence uses. Although
two of the species of pinnipeds on the Channel Islands, the northern fur seal and the harbor seal, are taken for subsistence
in Alaska, an incidental take from the populations in the Channel Islands would not reduce the availability of these
species for subsistence in Alaska. Therefore, NMFS has determined that this incidental taking will not have an unmitigable
adverse impact on the availability of marine mammals for subsistence by Alaska natives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations apply only to Navy projects involving the underwater detonation of conventional explosives in the
offshore waters of the OSTR of the NAWC, off Pt. Mugu, Ventura County, CA. All activities must be conducted in a manner
that minimizes adverse effects on marine mammals authorized to be taken and their habitat and in conformance with
any requirements in a LOA issued under these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these regulations NMFS is issuing the Navy a 1-year LOA. This LOA is the official document allowing the incidental
taking of marine mammals. It will be renewed annually upon receipt of a report detailing activities conducted during
the previous 12 months, including levels of taking of marine mammals, provided the required mitigation measures
are undertaken and the annual taking authorizations are not exceeded. If a species' annual authorization is exceeded,
NMFS will review the documentation submitted with the annual report to ensure that the taking continues to have no
more than a negligible impact on the species or stock involved.

The annual report must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), at least 120 days prior
to the date of expiration of the annual LOA in order for issuance of a LOA for the following year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any substantive changes to the conditions contained within the annual LOA, including suspension or withdrawal,
over the 5-year period the regulations are in effect will be subject to public review and comment unless NMFS determines
that an emergency exists that necessitates immediate action. Whether changes are ``substantive'' will be determined
by the AA. The regulations require the holder of the LOA to cooperate with NMFS and any other Federal, state or local
agency monitoring impacts resulting from this activity on these species. At its discretion, NMFS will place observers
onboard either the fleet tug or the target vessel, or both, and on any ship or aircraft involved in marine mammal reconnaissance
and monitoring either prior to, during, or after explosives detonation.

Effects of Military Testing Activities on Marine Mammals

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential impacts to marine mammals from explosives detonation include exposure to chemical by-products, lethal
and injurious incidental take, as well as physical and acoustic harassment. Injury or death could occur as a direct
result of the explosive blast (concussion) and resultant cavitation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Injury could include damage to internal organs and/or the auditory system. Non-injurious harassment of marine
mammals could occur as a result of physiological response to both the explosion-generated shockwave as well as to
the acoustic signature of the detonation. Based upon information provided by the Navy, NMFS believes it is unlikely
that injury will occur from exposure to the chemical by-products released into the surface waters.

 The area of cavitation is where the water pressure becomes extremely low with the passage of the negative shock wave
that moves down from the surface. The water separates, producing a region of cavitation bubbles for a brief time. This
region of cavitation bubbles then collapses and generates a weak positive pressure wave.

Measures to Reduce Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the highly mobile nature of ship shock tests, successful avoidance of, or reduction in, the incidental
taking of marine mammals is dependent upon the detection of marine mammals. Extensive pre-test surveys in the test
area are being conducted to document on-range marine mammal seasonal abundance and to detect areas of high mammal
density. Three 80-nm2 (275-km2) areas for ship shock tests will be identified prior to each test based on an analysis
of the 1993 NMFS 12-month aerial survey results and historical marine mammal survey data. Intensive aerial surveys
will be flown in the three targeted areas 1 month prior to the first scheduled shock test and the areas will subsequently
be ranked from low to high with respect to marine mammal density. An intensive survey will be conducted in the primary
test area 2 days prior to each scheduled shock test. If scientists determine that marine mammal density is higher than
previously predicted, the alternate secondary and tertiary areas will be surveyed to determine their short-term
suitability for shock tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On test days, extensive aerial and surface surveillance will be conducted to monitor for the presence, behavior and
condition of marine mammals before and after each detonation. Pre- and post-detonation aerial reconnaissance surveys
will be conducted from a fixed-wing aircraft, Navy helicopters, and from the test vessel. If marine mammals, sea turtles,
or endangered or threatened seabirds are seen within the 2-nm (3.7-km)-radius safety zone (for the 10,000-lb. (4,536-kg)
charge), detonation of the charge will be delayed until the animals exit the safety zone. Tests will not be conducted
if marine mammals, sea turtles, seabird flocks or fish schools are detected within the safety zone. Also, tests will
not be conducted when weather or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance. No detonations will be permitted
without the concurrence of the NAWC Ecologist assigned to the program as the Environmental Coordinator. Any dead
marine mammals and turtles seen by aerial survey observers during the pre-test (48 hours prior to test) aerial survey
of one or more of the three 80-nm2 (275-km2) will be documented and marked/tagged by MART, onboard an independent recovery
vessel, so that those animals that were dead prior to the ship shock test will not be included in incidental take numbers
reported to NMFS after the trial. Full necropsies will not be performed on these animals, although tissues may be collected
if time permits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After each detonation, an aerial reconnaissance survey of the ship shock test zone, to 3 nm (5.6 km) radial distance
from the detonation, will be conducted by NMFS SWFSC scientists who will notify the MART personnel if any dead or injured
marine animals are seen. The occurrence of live marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles will also be documented by
aerial and vessel survey personnel. Under the direction of a Navy marine mammal veterinarian, examination and recovery
of any dead or injured animals will be undertaken by MART. Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken by
MART's veterinary staff from any dead marine mammals or sea turtles. Activities related to the monitoring of the Navy
ship shock program will be authorized under these regulations and will not require a separate permit under section
104 of the MMPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure
and the monitoring methods will be reviewed by the Navy and NMFS and appropriate changes may be made. Inter-agency
coordination between the Navy and NMFS/SWFSC will ensure that the tests will proceed by the safest possible means.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 90 days after any detonation project, the Navy will have to submit a summary report to NMFS. This report must
include the following information: (1) Date and time of the test; (2) a summary of the pre-test and post-test activities
related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives detonation on marine mammal populations; and (3)
the results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or
killed as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An annual report must be submitted by the Navy to NMFS at least 120 days prior to the date of expiration of the annual LOA
in order for issuance of a LOA for the following year. This annual report must contain: (1) The date and time of all tests
conducted during the previous calendar year; (2) a description of all pre-test and post-test activities related
to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives detonation on marine mammal populations; (3) the results
of the post-test monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or killed
as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone; and (4)
the results of population assessment studies conducted by Navy or contract scientists, if any, made on marine mammals

NMFS will renew the LOA annually upon timely receipt of the summary and annual reports, a determination that the maximum
incidental take authorizations were not exceeded, and that the mitigation measures were undertaken. If one or more
species' lethal or serious injury take levels were reached or exceeded during the previous year, NMFS will require
the holder of the LOA to provide additional documentation, as may be requested, on the taking, including the results
of the required reviews of the ship shock test procedure and the monitoring methods and any measures that will be undertaken
in the following year to prevent exceeding the authorized incidental take levels in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While NMFS believes that detonation of the larger (i.e., 1,200- and 10,000-lb. (544- and 4,536-kg)) charges may affect
some marine mammals, the latest abundance and distribution estimates, based on the best available scientific information,
indicate that the taking will have no more than a negligible impact on the populations of marine mammals inhabiting
the waters of the SCB. NMFS concurs with the Navy that impacts can be mitigated by mandating conservative safety zones
for marine mammal exclusion, incorporating an active aerial survey monitoring effort in the program both prior to,
and after detonation of explosives, and provided tests are not conducted whenever marine mammals are detected within
the testing zone, or if weather and sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance.

zone of the State of California, a State with an approved coastal zone management program under the Coastal Zone Management
Act (CZMA). However, aerial monitoring and other mitigation measures that will be employed by the Navy prior to, and
during, testing will result in a negligible impact on marine mammals and other marine life. The Navy will be submitting
a consistency determination for this activity to the State of California's Division of Governmental Coordination
for review pursuant to the CZMA section 307(c)(1) and 15 CFR part 930, subpart C. The Navy, under 15 CFR 930.40 (multiple
Federal agency participation), will be the lead Federal agency for CZMA Federal consistency purposes.

(4) 10 detonations of 10 lbs (4.5 kg); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 20 detonations of 1 lb (0.45 kg), provided all terms, conditions, and requirements of these regulations and such
Letter of Authorization are complied with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The activity identified in paragraph (a) of this section must be conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest
extent possible, adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitat. When detonating explosives, the following
mitigation measures must be utilized: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If marine mammals are observed within the designated safety zone prescribed in the Letter of Authorization, or
on a course that will put them within the safety zone prior to detonation, detonation must be delayed until the marine
mammals are no longer within the safety zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If weather and/or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance, detonation must be delayed until conditions
improve sufficiently for aerial surveillance to be undertaken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure
and the monitoring methods must be reviewed and appropriate changes must be made prior to conducting the next project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to cooperate with the National Marine Fisheries Service
and any other Federal, state or local agency monitoring the impacts of the activity on marine mammals. The holder must
notify the Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, suite 4200,
Long Beach, CA (Telephone: (310) 980&hyph;4001), at least 2 weeks prior to activities involving the detonation of
explosives in order to satisfy paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate a qualified on-site individual(s) to record the effects
of explosives detonation on marine mammals that inhabit the Outer Sea Test Range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The primary test area, and if necessary, secondary and tertiary test areas, in the Outer Sea Test Range, must be
surveyed by marine mammal biologists and other trained individuals, and the marine mammal populations monitored,
approximately 48 hours prior to a scheduled detonation, on the day of detonation, and for a period of time specified
in the Letter of Authorization after each test or project. Monitoring shall include, but not necessarily be limited
to, aerial surveillance sufficient to ensure that no marine mammals are within the designated safety zone nor are
likely to enter the designated safety zone prior to or at the time of detonation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) Under the direction of a certified marine mammal veterinarian, examination and recovery of any dead or injured
marine mammals will be conducted. Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken from any dead animals. After
completion of the necropsy, animals not retained for shoreside examination, will be tagged and returned to the sea.
The occurrence of live marine mammals will also be documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the Letter of Authorization
issued under this part may include the retention of marine mammals without the need for a separate scientific research
permit. The use of such marine mammals in other scientific research may be authorized pursuant to 50 CFR parts 216 and
220. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) At its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service may place an observer on either the towing vessel, target
vessel, or both, and on any ship or aircraft involved in marine mammal reconnaissance, or monitoring either prior
to, during, or after explosives detonation in order to monitor the impact on marine mammals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A summary report must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, within 90 days after the
conclusion of any explosives detonation project. This report must include the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Date and time of the test(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A summary of the pre-test and post-test activities related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of explosives
detonation on marine mammal populations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/stock of any marine mammals noted injured or
killed as a result of the detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence within the safety zone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) An annual report must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, no later than 120 days prior
to the date of expiration of the annual Letter of Authorization in order for issuance of a Letter of Authorization for
the following year. This annual report must contain the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Date and time of all tests conducted under the expiring Letter of Authorization;

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA issues this final rule to implement gear requirements for vessels fishing for northern shrimp in the Northeast
multispecies fishery during the 1993/94 fishing season. Vessels fishing for or possessing northern shrimp in the
U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and all Federally permitted fishing vessels fishing for or possessing northern
shrimp are required to install and use a finfish excluder device throughout the fishing season and throughout the
range. The intent of this requirement is to reduce the bycatch of groundfish in the small-mesh northern shrimp fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations implementing Amendment 4 (56 FR 24724, May 31, 1991) to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast
Multispecies Fishery (FMP) include a measure that requires the New England Fishery Management Council (Council)
to make necessary recommendations to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), on gear requirements
for vessels fishing for northern shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council's recommendation for the 1993/94 fishery that any vessel catching, harvesting or landing northern shrimp
be required to use a finfish excluder device, particularly the Nordmore Grate (grate), with a rigid or semi-rigid
bar spacing of not more than one inch (2.54 cm), throughout the shrimp season, was published on November 8, 1993 (58
FR 59232). The notice also provided a summary of an economic analysis contained in an environmental assessment prepared
by the Council to accompany its recommendation. The publication of the recommendation initiated a comment period,
which concluded on December 3, 1993.

A comment on the Council's recommendation was received from the Center for Marine Conservation, which supported
approval of the Council's recommendation.

Changes From the Proposed Rule to the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes were made to all of the sections under &sect;651.20(b)(3)(vi), inclusive, to conform to the finfish excluder
device requirement as published in the proposed rule to Amendment 5 to the multispecies FMP (58 FR 57774). All of the
changes are for clarity and brevity. No substantive changes were made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is authorized by 50 CFR part 651 and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that the proposed rule,
if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, a regulatory
flexibility analysis was not prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that it is impracticable and contrary to the public
interest to delay for 30 days the effective date of this rule under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure
Act. Fishermen harvesting northern shrimp already are required to use Nordmore grates in state waters of Maine, New
Hampshire, and Massachusetts and have had ample time to adjust to this requirement. Implementation of this same requirement
in the EEZ provides similar requirements for fishermen throughout the range of the fishery.

(vi) Pursuant to &sect;651.20(b)(3)(iv), beginning January 31, 1994, any vessel issued a permit under &sect;651.4
that is fishing for, harvesting, possessing or landing northern shrimp, and any vessel fishing for, catching, harvesting
or possessing northern shrimp in the EEZ, must have a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device in
any net used to fish for or harvest northern shrimp, throughout the northern shrimp season as established or modified
by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The finfish excluder device must be configured and installed
consistent with the following specifications (see Figure 6 for an example of a properly configured and installed
finfish excluder device):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The finfish excluder device must be a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not more than 1 inch
(2.54 cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars
into the codend of the trawl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The finfish excluder device must be secured in the trawl, forward of the codend, in such a manner that it precludes
the passage of fish or other objects into the codend without said fish or objects have first passed between the bars
of the grate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A fish outlet or hole must be provided to allow fish or other objects that are too large to pass between the bars of
the grate to pass out of the net. The aftermost edge of this outlet must be at least as wide as the grate at the point of attachment.
Said fish outlet must extend forward from the grate toward the mouth of the net.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A funnel of net material is allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch towards
the grate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is issuing this interim final rule to revise its asbestos Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) to clarify the types of
persons who must be accredited to work with asbestos in schools and public and commercial buildings; to increase the
minimum number of hours of training, including additional hours of hands-on health and safety training, for asbestos
abatement workers and contractor/supervisors; and to effect a variety of other necessary changes as mandated by
section 15(a)(3) of the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). This revised rule replaces
the original MAP found at 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E. The original MAP contained six components which,
taken together, comprised a model asbestos accreditation plan for States and EPA-approved training providers.
These components included: (1) Initial training, (2) examinations, (3) refresher training, (4) qualifications,
(5) decertification requirements, and (6) reciprocity. This revision adds two new components to the original MAP;
(1) definitions, which help to determine the scope and applicability of the rule, and (2) new recordkeeping requirements
for the providers of accredited training courses. The changes also specify the deadline for States to modify their
accreditation programs to be no less stringent than the revised MAP as required by the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA) section 206(b)(2). Further, the revised MAP prescribes deadlines for training course providers and persons
who must obtain accreditation to comply with new requirements; distinguishes between the training requirements
for each of the five accredited training disciplines; adds several new topics to the project designer training curriculum;
establishes new enforcement criteria and Federal procedures for withdrawing approval from accredited persons
and training programs; and stipulates new information requirements for training certificates. Because the revisions
expand the minimum requirements for an accreditation plan, States may have to modify their programs to insure that
each State has a contractor accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as the revised MAP as required by TSCA section
206(b). Similarly, training providers may need to adjust their training course administration or curricula to comply
with the revised MAP. Finally, EPA has modified the organization, and some of the language of the original MAP. These
modifications, however, are technical, and do not impose new substantive requirements.

 This Rule is effective April 4, 1994. Because this is an interim final rule, EPA is accepting further comment on this

The Agency is requesting comment on this revised MAP only to the extent that it has amended or changed the original MAP.
The Agency is not soliciting comments on provisions of the original MAP that remain unaffected by this action. Specifically,
and notwithstanding the inclusion of some of the existing language from the original MAP in this revised MAP, the Agency
will only entertain comments to the extent that they address actual changes which have been incorporated. Appendix
C to subpart E of 40 CFR 763 is reproduced in its entirety solely for clarity and to facilitate understanding of how the
changes and amendments fit within the existing regulatory structure.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, Congress enacted the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA, or TSCA Title II) which mandated a regulatory
program to address asbestos hazards in schools. A part of AHERA (section 206; 15 U.S.C. 2646) dealt with the mandatory
training and accreditation of persons who would perform certain types of asbestos-related work in schools. Subsequently,
in 1990, Congress enacted ASHARA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;637), which amended AHERA to extend some of the training and accreditation
requirements to persons performing such work in public and commercial buildings. Consequently, EPA is now effecting
regulatory changes to reflect and implement these statutory amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, section 206 of AHERA required EPA to develop a MAP providing for the training of certain types of persons
performing asbestos-related work in elementary and secondary schools (15 U.S.C. 2646). Persons covered by this
original MAP included those who inspected school buildings for asbestos-containing materials (ACM); developed
asbestos management plans for schools; and designed or conducted response actions with respect to friable ACM, other
than small-scale, short-duration activities, in schools. Such persons were required to obtain accreditation as
a prerequisite to performing this work. AHERA also required States to adopt a State accreditation program that was
no less stringent than that described in the MAP (15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2)). Persons could then obtain accreditation
by completing either an EPA-approved training course, or a training course approved by a State with a program that
was at least as stringent as the MAP, and by passing an examination for that course. Individual States, however, could
elect to impose more stringent requirements as a condition of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original MAP established five accredited ``disciplines'' for asbestos-related activities in schools, which
included: worker, contractor/supervisor, inspector, management planner, and project designer. For each discipline,
it outlined a functional role and set of job responsibilities, and stipulated minimum training, examination, and
continuing education requirements. It established areas of knowledge of asbestos inspection, management plan
development, and response action technology that persons seeking accreditation must demonstrate and that States
must include in their accreditation programs. On November 28, 1990, Congress enacted ASHARA and expanded the accreditation
requirements to apply to persons who work with asbestos in public and commercial buildings as well as schools. Specifically,
ASHARA expanded TSCA section 206(a)(1) and (3) to require accreditation for any person who inspects for ACM in a public
and commercial building, or who designs or conducts a response action with respect to friable ACM in such a building.
As a result of this amendment, the MAP accreditation requirements for inspectors, project designers, workers, and
contractor/supervisors now apply equally to persons in both schools and public and commercial buildings. Congress,
however, did not extend the accreditation requirement for management planners. As a result, TSCA requires accreditation
for persons who prepare management plans if they work in schools, but does not require such accreditation if they work
in public and commercial buildings (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA also required EPA to revise the current MAP by increasing the minimum number of hours of training, including
hands-on training, required for asbestos abatement workers in both schools and public and commercial buildings.
ASHARA, however, did not specify the amount of additional training that would be required. In addition, ASHARA authorized
EPA to modify the MAP as necessary to implement the extension of accreditation requirements to public and commercial
buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, ASHARA amended the penalty provisions of TSCA section 207 (15 U.S.C. 2647). It provided for a civil penalty
for contractors who fail to comply with TSCA accreditation requirements by inspecting, designing, or conducting
a response action in a school or public or commercial building without TSCA accreditation, or by employing individuals
to conduct response actions in such a building, and failing to require or provide TSCA accreditation for the employees.
A contractor who commits a violation is liable for a civil penalty of $5,000 for each day of a violation, except for a
contractor who is a direct employee of the Federal Government (15 U.S.C. 2646 (g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASHARA accreditation provisions originally were to take effect on November 28, 1991. ASHARA, however, authorized
EPA's Administrator to extend that effective date for one year. On January 7, 1992, the Administrator took action
to extend the effective date until November 28, 1992 (57 FR 1913, January 16, 1992). The Administrator determined
that accredited asbestos contractors were needed to perform school site abatement required under AHERA, and that
such an extension was necessary to ensure effective implementation of section 203 of TSCA (ASHARA section 15(c)).
As a result of this extension, persons who perform inspections, or plan or conduct response actions in public and commercial
buildings were required to obtain TSCA accreditation beginning on November 28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to phase-in the other new requirements contained in the revised MAP when the revision takes effect.
These requirements include an increase in the minimum number of hours of training, including hands-on training,
for asbestos abatement workers in both schools and public and commercial buildings, and other necessary revisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is promulgating the revised MAP as an interim final rule that will take effect 60 days after the rule is published.
The streamlined procedures that EPA has utilized to revise the MAP are fully consistent with the Congressional directive
to EPA for developing the original MAP. AHERA specifically authorized the Agency to issue the MAP ``after consultation
with affected parties'' (15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A)). EPA issued it after a public request for information in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 28914, August 12, 1986) and consultations with affected parties, but without engaging in full-scale notice
and comment rulemaking. EPA has used procedures to revise the MAP that are as extensive as those that were used to develop
the original MAP. EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend EPA to engage in the redundancy
of consultation with affected parties and formal notice and comment rulemaking in either issuing the MAP or in revising
it, and therefore intended EPA to issue this revision to the MAP after undertaking similar consultations with affected
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that there is good cause to issue an interim final rule, without utilizing all of the notice and public comment
procedures in section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), because those procedures are impracticable
and unnecessary under the circumstances (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). It is impracticable to utilize the full-scale notice
and comment proceedings in section 553(b) because such proceedings would unjustifiably extend the rulemaking process,
and would further delay the implementation of the revised MAP. Congress clearly intended that EPA act expeditiously
to revise the MAP, and even established a deadline for the EPA revisions. EPA did not meet the deadline because of the
time-consuming process that was necessary to create an accreditation plan that would coordinate with existing,
diverse State accreditation programs, minimize disruption of current training providers, and contain other provisions
necessary to implement the revisions. If EPA were to develop and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant
to section 553(b), the revisions would have been even further delayed. The impact of such a delay would be exacerbated
by the additional time that is required for States to pass conforming legislation and implement the revised MAP after
it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, full-scale rulemaking is unnecessary because EPA has communicated informally with affected parties,
given notice of the revisions to the public, and provided an opportunity to submit information and comments prior
to promulgating this interim final rule. Initially, the Agency consulted with affected organizations to identify
revisions that were necessitated by ASHARA. These organizations included schools, commercial building owners
and operators, asbestos abatement consultants and contractors, labor organizations, training providers, and
States. Subsequently, EPA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that described the revisions that were being considered, and announced a public meeting to discuss the changes (57
FR 20438, May 13, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also established a docket containing information which supports EPA's revision of the MAP. To provide interested
persons the opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the changes under consideration,
EPA held a public meeting on June 8, 1992, in Washington, DC. Twenty-three persons presented oral comments for the
record. A transcript of this proceeding is contained in the docket. EPA also received 80 written comments in response
to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement. These comments have also been filed in the docket, and were carefully considered by the Agency in revising
the MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The various new requirements of the MAP are described here in greater detail. This summary is organized by subject
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgated revisions establish a new definitions section for the MAP. Seven terms are included to help clarify
and delineate the scope and applicability of the MAP to work performed in public and commercial buildings. The seven
terms, and their meanings, are summarized below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public and commercial building.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``public and commercial building'' is defined in TSCA section 202(10) to mean ``any building which is not
a school building, except that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units''
(15 U.S.C. 2642(10)). This definition identifies those buildings where persons performing certain asbestos-related
work are subject to the MAP training and accreditation requirements. Such buildings generally include apartment
complexes, condominiums and cooperatives of more than 10 units, office buildings, government-owned buildings,
colleges, museums, airports, hospitals, churches, preschools, stores, warehouses, and factories. It also includes
all industrial buildings, because industrial buildings are included within the broad statutory definition of public
and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This particular term does not include elementary or secondary schools as defined in section 198 of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 2854; 15 U.S.C. 2642(9) and (12)). The definition in the revised MAP
excludes all detached single family homes, because they are residential buildings of fewer than 10 dwelling units.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, consistent with the statute and EPA's regulatory approach for schools, the term is interpreted to include
only the interiors of buildings except for exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems
used to condition interior space. Consequently, accredited workers are generally not required for work on roofing
or siding materials that are on the outside of either public and commercial buildings or schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In TSCA section 202, friable asbestos-containing material means any material containing more than one percent
asbestos, which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a
building, which, when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable
ACM after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized,
or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C. 2642(6)). At no point does the statute regulate activities that
involve nonbuilding materials, such as asbestos gloves or asbestos brake linings, that may be either stored or used
inside of a building. Consequently, the use of the term ``friable ACM'' in the MAP refers only to ``friable asbestos-containing
building material (ACBM),'' and, where the statute requires accreditation for activities associated with ACM,
accreditation is only required if the asbestos is part of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although AHERA required that schools conduct asbestos inspections, ASHARA did not extend this same requirement
to public and commercial buildings. Furthermore, because the Asbestos-Containing Materials in Schools Rule (``Schools
Rule'') (40 CFR 763.80&hyph;763.119) simply listed the various activities required to be included as a part of these
mandatory school inspections (40 CFR 763.85), without actually defining the term itself, a definition of ``inspection''
is necessary to delineate the scope of the MAP accreditation requirement as it applies to both schools and public and
commercial buildings. Accordingly, the term ``inspection'' is defined to mean those activities undertaken to specifically
determine the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable ACBM or suspected ACBM,
whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. Similarly, the term includes
all ``reinspections'' of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of a definition for the term inspection is intended to clarify when a person must obtain TSCA accreditation
before performing an inspection. TSCA Title II, as amended by ASHARA, did not define inspection. When Congress enacted
ASHARA, however, the Schools Rule was in effect, and it identified the activities that constituted an inspection
in school buildings (40 CFR 763.85 and 763.92). The definition of inspection adopted in the revised MAP is based upon
the core inspection activities identified in the Schools Rule at &sect;763.85(a), including the visual or physical
examination, and the sampling of ACBM or suspected ACBM to determine its location or presence or to assess its physical
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the revised MAP, a person must be accredited to engage in any one of these core activities in a school or in
a public and commercial building. In addition, the Schools Rule continues to require accreditation for any person
who engages in any one of these core activities. Because the Schools Rule currently requires an accredited person
to conduct the core inspection activities, and the revised MAP requires accreditation for those same activities,
the revision will not expand the need for accredited inspectors in schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition, however, also allows for three specific exceptions, dealing with related activities which do not
require accreditation. The three excepted activities include: periodic surveillance, compliance inspections,
and visual inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first exception under this term addresses periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b), which
is commonly performed by custodial or maintenance workers. Periodic surveillance is distinct from reinspection
and is limited only to visual observations. It refers to a visual examination of an area in a building that previously
has been identified as containing ACBM, or that previously has been assumed to contain ACBM, and that is undertaken
to identify changes in the physical condition of that ACBM. Thus, a person would not need accreditation to visually
survey a ceiling that had already been identified in an earlier inspection or reinspection as suspected ACBM to determine
whether the ceiling had been damaged by a water leak. If the person assessed the condition of the ceiling by collecting
a sample, or touched it to determine whether it had become friable, however, then that person would have to be accredited
as an inspector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of activity that is excluded from the definition of inspection is compliance inspections performed
by Federal, State, or local regulatory agencies. These are excluded from accreditation because their primary purpose
is to determine adherence to applicable statutes or regulations, and not to locate, assess, or remedy the condition
of ACBM. TSCA Title II does not provide a clear definition of the types of inspection activities that require training.
The legislative history of ASHARA, however, indicates that Congress intended to require training only for those
persons who actually inspect for or abate asbestos in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 136 Cong. Rec. S15304 (Oct. 15, 1990) (statement of Sen. Burdick). Based upon the purpose of ASHARA, EPA has concluded
that government personnel who inspect to determine compliance with laws regulating asbestos are not required to
obtain accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third exception involves visual inspections of the type referenced in 40 CFR 763.90(i). These types of activities
are excluded from the accreditation requirement because their purpose is to determine whether a response action
is complete, not to actually inspect for asbestos. See 136 Cong. Rec. S15304 (Oct. 15,1990) (statement of Sen. Burdick).
Moreover, when Congress enacted ASHARA, it was aware that AHERA required accreditation for persons who inspected
for asbestos in schools. Persons who conducted visual inspections in schools to determine whether a response action
was complete, however, did not have to be accredited as inspectors. The legislative history of ASHARA indicates that
Congress did not intend to expand the categories of persons that had to be accredited when it modified the accreditation
requirements to include public and commercial buildings as well as schools. As noted by Senator Chafee: ``[ASHARA]
does not require the accreditation of any category of individuals not now required to be accredited to perform asbestos
abatement work [under AHERA].'' 136 Cong. Rec. S15309 (Oct. 15, 1990) (statement of Sen. Chafee). Consequently,
EPA has concluded that a person who conducts an inspection in a public and commercial building to determine whether
a response action is complete does not have to be accredited as an inspector. Of course, many persons performing such
activities will otherwise need accreditation as asbestos abatement workers or contractor/supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``response action'' is defined in the MAP to mean a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure,
repair, and operation and maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM. This definition
is consistent with the definition of ``response action'' in TSCA section 202(11) (15 U.S.C. 2642(11)), and with the
definition of ``response action'' in the Schools Rule found at 40 CFR 763.83. Its incorporation into the revised MAP
will therefore ensure that it applies equally to regulated activities in both schools and public and commercial buildings.
Consequently, those activities that are response actions in schools will also now be response actions when and where
they are undertaken in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, a person planning or conducting a response action is subject to the MAP accreditation requirements only
if the ACBM is friable (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)(3)). As defined in both the MAP and in TSCA section 202(6), ``friable ACM''
refers only to ACM that ``when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C.
2642(6)). It also includes previously ``nonfriable material after such previously non-friable material becomes
damaged to the extent that when dry, it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure'' (15 U.S.C.
2642(6)). This statutory definition of friability thereby limits the scope of the accreditation requirements for
response actions in both schools and public and commercial buildings to ACBM that is friable or expected to become
friable during the course of the response action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small-scale, short-duration activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the revised MAP, ``small-scale, short duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited
to: (a) Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes, (b) removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing
insulation on beams or above ceilings, (c) replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve, (d) installation
or removal of a small section of drywall, or (e) installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations: (a) Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required
in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended as asbestos abatement, (b) removal of asbestos-containing
thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single glove bag, (c)
minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal, (d) repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing
wallboard, or (e) repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only
if required in the performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement
(such work may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure.
Such an enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended
containment function). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is intended to establish a common exemption threshold for both schools and public and commercial
buildings that limits the applicability of the MAP training and accreditation requirements. All persons in schools
or public and commercial buildings who perform SSSD that do not otherwise meet the criteria for a major fiber release
episode under 40 CFR 763.91(f)(2) are exempt from the MAP accreditation requirements. However, a SSSD removal of
more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM, where this amount of friable ACBM either falls or is dislodged, requires
the use of an accredited worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major and minor fiber release episodes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To help clarify the applicability and limits of the SSSD exemption under the MAP, EPA is incorporating two additional
definitions for the terms ``Minor Fiber Release Episode'' and ``Major Fiber Release Episode.'' Consistent with
the Schools Rule (40 CFR 763.83 and 763.91(e), (f)), a minor fiber release episode is ``any uncontrolled or unintentional
disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission'' that ``involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear
feet or less of friable ACBM.'' A major fiber release episode is ``any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance
of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission'' that ``involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear
feet of friable ACBM.'' The Schools Rule uses these terms, in addition to SSSD, as a means to distinguish between those
maintenance activities that require the use of accredited workers, and those that do not. These terms help delineate
when persons performing operation and maintenance activities are subject to MAP training and accreditation requirements.
Like SSSD, they are basic to determining the scope of the regulation, and have been added for that reason.

B. Phased Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that it is necessary to phase-in the MAP revisions to achieve an orderly transition to the revised plan.
Additional time will be needed after the revised MAP has taken effect for States to adopt accreditation plans no less
stringent than the revised MAP, for training course providers to modify their training courses in keeping with upgraded
MAP standards, and for individuals to obtain new or additional training where applicable. For these reasons, the
revisions incorporate a timetable with two distinct deadlines; one that applies to States, and another for accredited
persons and training course providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow States a comparable amount of time to come into compliance with the revised
MAP as was allowed under the original MAP. Therefore, the requirement of the original MAP, that each State must adopt
an accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA model plan within 180 days after the commencement of the first
regular session of the State's legislature following EPA's adoption of the model plan, is carried over to the revised
MAP. When Congress originally enacted AHERA, it required States to adopt such a plan, and established a deadline that
was tied to the timing of the first legislative session following completion of the MAP. When it promulgated ASHARA,
Congress did not modify TSCA section 206(b)(2) that requires States to have a plan at least as stringent as the MAP (15
U.S.C. 2646(b)(2)). When Congress enacted ASHARA, it was aware that States would need time to enact conforming State
legislation. It is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to allow States the same amount of time to adopt implementing
legislation to comply with the MAP revisions in ASHARA that it had originally allowed for compliance with AHERA. The
deadline for State revisions of accreditation plans allows States the time that is needed to revise State laws. When
this deadline is combined with the other provisions to phase-in the MAP revisions, EPA believes that there will be
an orderly transition to the expanded system of accreditation for schools, and public and commercial buildings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States already will have contractor accreditation programs that meet or exceed the upgraded MAP requirements
when the revised MAP takes effect. These States are essentially unaffected by the revisions, and may continue to operate
as before. A second group of States will not have accreditation programs in place that are as stringent as the revised
MAP when it first takes effect, but will have preexisting accreditation programs that are in compliance with the original
MAP. These State programs may or may not be approved by EPA under the revised MAP. Until such a State revises its program
to comply with the upgraded MAP standards, it will not have the authority to approve any new training courses to provide
training or accreditation that satisfies the requirements of TSCA section 206(a) (15 U.S.C. 2646(a)). In the interim,
however, the State may continue to train persons and issue the accreditation required by TSCA section 206(a) if the
State program otherwise complies with the minimum standards of the original MAP. The State also may continue its approval
of training course providers, if the State issued the approval before the effective date of the revised MAP, and the
training provider is in compliance with the self-certification requirements contained in Unit V.B. of the revised
MAP. This allows qualified training course providers to continue to train and issue accreditation that satisfies
TSCA section 206(a) requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States in the second group will revise their accreditation program to be at least as stringent as the MAP within
180 days after the commencement of the legislature's first regular session that is convened after the effective date
of the revised MAP. When such a State achieves this program upgrade, it will regain the authority to approve new training
course providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other States in the second group, however, may fail to meet the deadline for achieving the necessary program upgrade.
Beginning on their respective deadline dates, these States will no longer have the authority to train persons or issue
accreditation that satisfies the requirements of TSCA section 206(a), or to approve training course providers to
conduct TSCA training or issue TSCA accreditation. A training provider that had been approved by such a State automatically
loses its State approval. A training provider that loses State approval in this manner, however, will become EPA-approved
if the provider has self-certified and is otherwise in compliance with the revised MAP. Finally, such a State automatically
loses any EPA approval it may have had. Once lost, a State would need to reapply for such approval under the procedures
outlined in Unit II of the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third group of States will not have any accreditation program in place when the revised MAP takes effect, or will not
have a program which is at least as stringent as the original or revised MAP. These States are not in compliance with
TSCA Title II, are not authorized to train persons or issue accreditation that satisfy the requirements of TSCA section
206(a), and may not approve training course providers to conduct TSCA training or issue TSCA accreditation. EPA strongly
recommends that States apply for and retain EPA approval of their accreditation programs for the purpose of substantiating
their compliance status under TSCA Title II. Substantiation of compliance benefits all affected persons and organizations,
including States that may be considering reciprocal arrangements with other States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training course providers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revised MAP stipulates that all approved training course providers, whether approved by EPA or a State, must self-certify
that they have upgraded their approved training programs to comply with the requirements of the revised MAP within
6 months of the revised MAP taking effect. The certification must be received by EPA on or before October 4, 1994. This
requirement applies across-the-board to all initial and refresher training courses in all five accredited disciplines
even though actual curriculum modifications are only required for the initial worker, contractor/supervisor,
and project designer courses. Self-certification is required for all courses and all disciplines because all training
providers must certify that they not only comply with the prescribed training course curricula, but with the new recordkeeping
and certificate provisions of the revised MAP as well. The self-certification process is to be accomplished by submitting
a written assurance to EPA that courses and programs have been appropriately modified. The self-certification must
be signed by an authorized representative of the training provider, and must include the following statement: ``Under
civil and criminal penalties of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations
(18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable
requirements of Title II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal,
state, or local requirements.'' The self-certification submission must also include documentation adequately
describing the course and program modifications effected to achieve compliance with the revised MAP. Training providers
with multiple course approvals are encouraged to certify all such courses through a single consolidated submission.
Complete duplicate copies of self-certifications must also be sent to and received by any State approving offices
as of the same deadline date. Training courses that have not self-certified as of October 4, 1994, will no longer be
approved, and must reapply through a State Program which is no less stringent than the revised MAP to have their approval
status restored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was previously announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 38802, September 20, 1989), EPA stopped accepting new training course applications from providers for review
and contingent approval as of October 15, 1989. Since that date, all training courses without approval have had to
apply directly to State Programs with accreditation plans no less stringent than the original MAP in order to obtain
the necessary approval. Once a training course has been self-certified, a training provider may continue to offer
that training course pursuant to the revised MAP. If the course had initially been approved by an EPA-approved State,
and that State subsequently forfeits its EPA-approved status, EPA will continue to recognize the training course
as being an approved course if it has been self-certified and otherwise remains in compliance with the revised MAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accredited persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revisions grandfather all persons who possess valid accreditation as of the day before the date upon which the
revised MAP goes into effect. A person is considered to have valid accreditation if they are in possession of an accreditation
certificate that has not yet expired. If a State allows a person with an expired certificate to reinstate accreditation
by completing refresher training within the 12&hyph;month grace period, then such a person will also be considered
to have valid accreditation for purposes of grandfathering. The person must successfully complete the necessary
refresher training course within 12 months of the date their certificate expires. Persons who do not meet either of
the above conditions do not possess valid accreditation, and will not be grandfathered for purposes of accreditation
under the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandfathered persons will not have to repeat initial training in order to perform work subject to accreditation,
but will have to continue to fully comply with all annual refresher training requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who do not possess valid accreditation as of the day before the date upon which the revised MAP goes into effect
have two alternative means of obtaining initial accreditation. A person may take an upgraded training course, and
obtain accreditation that complies with the revised MAP. Alternatively, a person may take a course that was approved
under the original MAP and obtain provisional accreditation. However, this person must then also complete the upgraded
training course for the same discipline within 6-months of the revised MAP taking effect, on or before October 4, 1994,
in order to obtain accreditation that complies with the revised MAP and to continue working beyond that date. This
mechanism will ensure that all persons who become newly accredited after the revised MAP takes effect will meet the
upgraded training standards within 6 months, while at the same time, making it possible for all persons to acquire
a provisional accreditation and continue to work during the 6&hyph;month transition period when training providers
are upgrading their courses and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From earlier consultations with training providers, EPA anticipates that many, if not most, will have little or no
difficulty transitioning to the upgraded training course standards (OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log No. B2&hyph;002).
For worker and contractor/supervisor courses, this involves extending hands-on training from 6 to 14 hours. For
the project designer course, it involves revising instructional materials as necessary to accomodate curriculum
changes. For the inspector and management planner courses, there are no required curriculum changes per se. Because
many training providers already comply with the new recordkeeping and certificate requirements as a matter of standard
business practice, these adjustments are not expected to be burdensome. Development and submittal of the self-certification
letter, by design, should also be a relatively simple task. In addition, EPA expects that once the revised MAP has gone
into effect, demand for the upgraded training courses in favor of the original courses will provide sufficient market
incentive for a significant number of training providers to self-certify quickly, thereby expediting an infrastructure
shift from the old courses to the new. The examples below are intended to help illustrate how accreditation will operate
during the transition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Person ``A'' obtains initial accreditation as a worker 1&hyph;month before the revised MAP takes effect. This
person is then grandfathered in when the revised MAP goes into effect 1&hyph;month later. The person must then complete
worker refresher training within 11 months after the revised MAP takes effect in order to continue accreditation
status unbroken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Person ``B'' is a non-accredited consultant who is awarded an asbestos abatement contract 4 months after the revised
MAP takes effect. This person is able to find and quickly complete an upgraded contractor/supervisor course, thereby
obtaining initial accreditation. This person has met the new training standards, and thus is unaffected by the 6&hyph;month
compliance deadline. The consultant must then satisfy the refresher training requirement within 1&hyph;year of
the initial accreditation date in order to continue uninterrupted contractor/supervisor work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Person ``C'' is a non-accredited consultant who is awarded a contract for project design 1-month after the effective
date of the revised MAP. This person is unable to find an upgraded training course, so opts to take the old initial project
designer training course and begin contract work without undue delay. This person may begin work, but must complete
an upgraded project designer course within the 6-month compliance deadline in order to continue working in an uninterrupted
manner. A consultant who does not complete the upgraded training course by the compliance deadline must then stop
work that requires TSCA accreditation until obtaining upgraded accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same transitional provisions apply to any person who seeks initial accreditation after the revised MAP takes
effect, including inspectors and management planners. The revised MAP imposes certain new requirements on all disciplines,
specifically new recordkeeping and certificate requirements. EPA has concluded that everyone who is initially
accredited after the revised MAP takes effect should be subject to the same transitional provisions to insure that
their training and accreditation will be adequately documented as required by the new rule, and that they will have
certificates that contain all the necessary information. Such uniformity will make the accreditation requirements
easier to comply with and enforce.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Distinct Training Disciplines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These MAP revisions reaffirm the principle that each of the five accredited training disciplines in the MAP is distinct
from the others. Because each discipline reflects a different functional job role, proficiency in any one of the five
disciplines requires a different mix of knowledge, skill, and ability. Even where training programs cover common
subjects, these same subjects need to be given a different priority and emphasis depending upon the particular discipline
a person is being trained for. To ensure that each discipline receives adequate training, the revisions have incorporated
the following changed requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each initial and refresher training course offered for accreditation must be specific to a single discipline,
and not combined with training for any other discipline. The past practice of training providers offering combined
worker and contractor/supervisor training is not allowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Workers are no longer permitted to ``upgrade'' their worker accreditation to that of contractor/supervisor by
completing only one additional day of training. Separate initial training as a contractor/supervisor is now required.
Accredited contractor/supervisors, however, may perform as workers without obtaining separate accreditation
as such. This is because contractor/supervisors have received more training in the aggregate than workers to ensure
that they can perform their more complex job functions, and they must otherwise know how to perform all of the various
tasks which workers are normally called upon to perform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Persons completing initial training for accreditation as contractor/supervisors are no longer permitted to
work as accredited project designers during their initial 1-year term of accreditation. This dual-accreditation
provision, found in section I.1.C. of the original MAP, has been deleted from the revised MAP. Persons seeking accreditation
as contractor/supervisors must now complete the new 5&hyph;day initial training for contractor/supervisors,
and persons seeking accreditation as project designers must now complete the new 3&hyph;day initial training for
project designers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Increased Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 15(a)(3) of ASHARA mandated that EPA, as a part of revising its MAP, increase the minimum number of training
hours, including additional hours of hands-on health and safety training, required for the accreditation of asbestos
abatement workers in schools and public and commercial buildings. EPA interprets the phrase ``asbestos abatement
workers'' to include both workers and contractor/supervisors. These groups have the greatest need for additional
hands-on training because they either actually perform asbestos abatement work, or directly oversee it at the job
site. The revised MAP therefore incorporates 1 additional 8&hyph;hour day of hands-on training for both the worker
and the contractor/supervisor disciplines. This has the effect of increasing the worker course from a total of 3 days
to 4 days of training, with the hands-on training component increased from 6 hours to 14 hours. Similarly, the 4&hyph;day
contractor/supervisor course has been upgraded to a 5&hyph;day course, with 14 hours of hands-on activity. These
training hour requirements not only fulfill the statutory mandate for additional hands-on training for asbestos
abatement workers, but also ensure that training can be obtained within the practical limits of a normal 40&hyph;hour,
5&hyph;day work-week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum training hour requirements for the other three accredited MAP disciplines, that of inspector, management
planner, and project designer have not been altered. Congress only mandated increased training for asbestos abatement
workers, and the only accredited disciplines directly engaged in hands-on abatement work are the worker and contractor/supervisor.
The project designer and management planner courses do not include any hands-on health and safety training component.
Because inspectors likewise do not participate in abatement, the existing 4-hour hands-on component for inspectors
is unaffected by the ASHARA mandate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Expanded Project Designer Curriculum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAP revisions incorporate several additions to the mandatory curriculum for accredited project designer training,
but do not extend the required length of this initial training program. These changes relate only to the scope of training;
they do not require an accredited project designer to perform any particular work practices. Because of concerns
that project designs may sometimes be either inadequately prepared and/or executed, the curriculum additions are
aimed at both clarifying and improving the effectiveness of the project designer's functional role (see OPPTS Docket
No. 62107, Log No. C1&hyph;030). Where no written design plan exists, implementation can be prone to failure. This
may also occur where a project design has not adequately considered all relevant facets of an abatement project. For
these reasons, the six new topics which have been added include: (1) The need for and methods of preparing a written
project design, (2) techniques for completing an initial cleaning of the work area, (3) increased emphasis on the
rationale behind the establishment of functional spaces, (4) the need for written diagrams and methods of diagraming
all containment barriers, (5) the need for a written sampling rationale for air clearance, and (6) clarification
of what constitutes a complete visual inspection.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Deaccreditation of Persons and Withdrawal of Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MAP revisions establish minimum national criteria for suspending or revoking the accreditation of individuals
as well as for suspending or withdrawing the approval of training courses. Also included are additional criteria
that EPA may use, and States are free to adopt, as well as the procedures that EPA will follow when suspending, revoking,
or withdrawing accreditation or approval. The specified procedures are derived from those used for the suspension,
modification, or revocation of pesticide applicator certificates found at 40 CFR 171.11(f). EPA believes that these
procedures provide adequate notice and process to affected individuals and training course providers, while enabling
the Agency to act more quickly than through those procedures specified at 40 CFR part 22, which had also been considered
by the Agency. States, in initiating these kinds of actions, would be bound by the requirements of their own State administrative
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enumeration of criteria for suspension, revocation, or withdrawal is not meant to be a complete list of enforcement
actions and choices available to EPA. Since the MAP is a regulation promulgated under Title II of TSCA, persons violating
the MAP may also be subject to assessment of civil administrative penalties. The MAP revisions also clarify that EPA
may take independent actions against either training entities or accredited persons, without reliance upon State
enforcement authority or initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deaccrediting persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four minimum criteria are established for triggering deaccreditation actions by EPA or a State. They include: (1)
Performing work requiring accreditation at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current
accreditation certificates; (2) permitting the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another;
(3) performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or (4) obtaining accreditation from a training
provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State
that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may also suspend or revoke a person's accreditation if such person has been found in violation of other asbestos
regulations administered by EPA. States may wish to adopt this criterion, or modify it to include their own asbestos
statutes or regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the revised MAP identifies some of the situations when a person who is performing an activity that requires
accreditation will be subject to civil penalties under TSCA. Examples include, but are not limited to: (1) Obtaining
accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents; (2) obtaining training
documentation through fraudulent means; (3) gaining admission to and completing refresher training through fraudulent
representation of initial or previous refresher training documentation; or (4) obtaining accreditation through
fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such as education, training, professional registration,
or experience. This list is not exhaustive, and there may be other situations where persons may be subject to penalties
under TSCA by conducting work without the requisite accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of course approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This new provision requires that States have minimum criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval
from approved training courses. In pursuing actions for withdrawal of approval of accredited training programs,
States should follow their own State administrative procedures. EPA may directly pursue actions for withdrawal
of approval of accredited training programs without reliance on State withdrawal actions or enforcement authority
or actions. In taking such actions, EPA will use the same procedures specified for the suspension or revocation of
accreditation, those found at 40 CFR 171.11(f), to suspend or withdraw approval of a training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to have the ability to withdraw approval of accredited training programs if field site inspections
indicate that a training course is not conducting training that meets the requirements of the EPA MAP. Similarly,
the requirement that training course providers permit EPA representatives to attend, evaluate, and monitor any
training course without charge to EPA is preserved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that training providers should understand the criteria that the Agency will use to trigger a withdrawal
action. Minimum criteria which trigger the commencement of a withdrawal action for withdrawal of approval of accredited
training programs have been added to the MAP, including: (a) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's
approval by a State or EPA; (b) failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner; (c) failure
to maintain requisite records; (d) falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other
accreditation information; or (e) failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA or State
MAP as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval if an approved training course instructor or other person
with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found in violation of other asbestos regulations
administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation, or execution of a consent agreement and
order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant statutes and regulations. States
may wish to adopt this additional criterion, or modify it to include their own asbestos statutes or regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formal procedures for withdrawing course approval do not apply to training providers that fail to comply with
the self-certification requirements of the revised MAP and that do not upgrade their courses within 6 months of the
effective date of the revised MAP. EPA is provisionally allowing training providers to continue to operate during
that 6-month period pursuant to approval granted under the original MAP. A training provider that fails to comply
with the self-certification requirements within 6 months, however, automatically loses its provisional approval
by operation of law. No individual notices or adjudicative process is required to effect the loss of such provisional
approvals pursuant to this rule.

G. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised MAP imposes a variety of new recordkeeping requirements on training providers that are necessary to strengthen
compliance with MAP training standards and to enable more vigorous enforcement of those standards by both EPA and
the States. Four different types of records must be maintained: (1) Records documenting approved training course
materials (e.g., copies of student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts), (2) records demonstrating instructor
qualifications (e.g., copies of resumes, approval letters, dates and names of courses taught), (3) records documenting
examinations (e.g., copies of tests used, individual student scores, dates and locations of exams given), and (4)
records documenting accreditation certificates (e.g., to whom conferred, for which disciplines, dates of issuance
and expiration). The revisions further stipulate that all such records must be retained for at least 3 years, and that
reasonable access to all such records must be provided upon request to either or both EPA and the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Accreditation Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised MAP stipulates that each accreditation certificate issued by an approved training provider must now
contain certain additional items of information which had not been specified in the original MAP. The new minimum
certificate standard is intended to enable quick identification of and contact with the training provider that issued
the certificate. The revised MAP specifically requires the inclusion of the issuing provider's name, address, and
telephone number. This mechanism makes it possible for training providers, regulatory agencies, and the general
public to verify the accreditation status of persons performing work subject to the MAP.

III. Responses to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the various MAP changes being considered by EPA were received from many affected interest groups, including
States, commercial buildings owners and managers, labor organizations, trade associations, asbestos contractors
and consultants, training entities, power companies, universities, and federal agencies other than EPA. These
written comments may be found in the docket supporting this action (OPPTS&hyph;62107). This Unit discusses EPA's
responses to the significant issues raised in the comments received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public and commercial buildings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters urged EPA to incorporate the NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants) definition of ``facility,'' so that greater consistency might be achieved between the various EPA asbestos
rules. Although EPA is sympathetic to promoting regulatory integration whenever feasible, the statutory language
of TSCA section 202(10) complicates this attempt. A regulated ``facility'' under the NESHAP includes residential
buildings of more than four units, whereas the TSCA definition of ``public and commercial building'' includes residential
apartment buildings of 10 or more units. Because EPA's mandate to issue and revise the MAP comes from TSCA, as amended
by ASHARA, the TSCA definition is controlling. EPA must use the TSCA definition, even though it is less inclusive than
NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters suggested that the definition of the term ``public and commercial building'' should include ACM
that is located both on the insides and the exteriors of buildings. EPA had earlier examined this same issue when it
promulgated the Schools Rule and the original MAP pursuant to AHERA. At that time, EPA concluded that when AHERA used
the phrase ``in a school building,'' it meant the interior of the building, not the exterior (52 FR 41835, October 30,
1987). EPA adopted that interpretation in the Schools Rule which was in effect when Congress amended AHERA by enacting
ASHARA. EPA believes that Congress intended the term ``in'' a public or commercial building to be given the same meaning
as ``in'' a school building in the Schools Rule. Consistent with the approach incorporated in the Schools Rule, training
is required for work in interior areas only, except for exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical
systems used to condition interior space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several power companies and other industrial/manufacturing concerns objected to the Agency's proposal to include
``industrial'' buildings within the scope of the rule. They argued that the public generally does not have access
to these buildings, is therefore not exposed, and that workers in these industrial buildings are already adequately
protected by the OSHA asbestos standards or the EPA Worker Protection Rule. The accreditation requirements of the
statute, however, clearly extend to activities in industrial buildings. TSCA section 202(10) defines ``public
and commercial buildings'' expansively to mean ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 building which is not a school building, except the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer
than 10 units'' (15 U.S.C. 2642(10)) (emphasis added). The statutory definition includes all buildings with only
two express exclusions for school buildings and residential buildings. Industrial buildings clearly do not qualify
for either exemption. Thus, they fall within the category of any other type of building that is encompassed by the term
``public and commercial building.'' Moreover, when Congress enacted ASHARA, it relied, in part, upon EPA's assessment
of risk in public and commercial buildings, an assessment that included industrial buildings. EPA's 1988 Report
to Congress on Asbestos in Buildings specifically identified industrial buildings as one of the types of structures
included under the TSCA definition of ``public and commercial buildings'' (Report to Congress, page 2). Further,
the inclusion of industrial buildings in the category of buildings where training is required is consistent with
the purpose of ASHARA to protect workers as well as the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In extending the MAP training and accreditation requirements to public and commercial buildings under the ASHARA
mandate, EPA recognizes that the revised MAP will now apply to activities in buildings that may be subject to the specific
training requirements of other Federal asbestos regulations. This includes the competent person training requirements
under the OSHA Asbestos Standard (29 CFR 1926.58) and the EPA Worker Protection Rule (40 CFR 763.121), the on-site
representative training requirements under the asbestos NESHAP (40 CFR 61.145), and the training requirements
for designated persons and operations and maintenance personnel found in the Schools Rule (40 CFR 763.84&hyph; 763.92).
EPA wishes to clarify that a person subject to the accredited training requirements of the MAP will also remain subject
to the applicable training requirements of these other asbestos rules. Compliance with the MAP does not automatically
relieve a person of responsibilities under other asbestos rules.

Friable ACM.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters, citing the need for regulatory consistency between schools and public and commercial buildings,
urged the Agency to preserve the concept of friable ACM which had been applied in the Schools Rule. EPA agrees with this
approach because it is consistent with the statutory mandate and because consistency between the Schools Rule and
the MAP is desirable. Both rules must comply with the same TSCA section 202(6) definition of friable ACM. Thus, the
Agency has incorporated that definition into the MAP. This ties the definition to ACBM that is or may become friable.

 notice (57 FR 20438). This expansive approach would not only extend accreditation requirements to include general
environmental hazard assessments for insurance and real estate purposes, but also would specifically extend those
requirements to all of the inspection-type activities required by other asbestos rules such as the Schools Rule,
NESHAP, the EPA Worker Protection Rule and the OSHA Asbestos Standard. EPA believes that such an all encompassing
definition is not warranted based upon risk, and would therefore result in unnecessary costs (see OPPTS Docket No.
62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;025, C1&hyph;035, C1&hyph;038). EPA has elected a more targeted approach which focuses
on both the object and the activity of inspecting for asbestos. The statute limits the accreditation requirement
to those persons who ``inspect for ACM in school buildings...or in a public or commercial building'' (15 USC 2646 (a)(1)).
EPA has adhered to this statutory language, and required accreditation only for those persons who inspect or reinspect
specifically for ACBM. This would include, however, an inspection undertaken pursuant to NESHAP (40 CFR 61.145(a))
in a school, or public and commercial building, where the building owner or operator is required to thoroughly inspect
the building for the presence of asbestos prior to commencing a demolition or renovation activity. Similarly, inspections
required by other regulations would also be subject to accreditation, if the inspection, as defined in the revised
MAP, included a component that was specific to ACBM, and was conducted within a school, or public and commercial building
subject to the revised MAP. This includes more general inspection-type activities (e.g., environmental assessments)
where asbestos is one of several potential hazards or materials that are being looked for or examined. Regardless
of what other activities a person may be undertaking, if the person is inspecting for ACBM in a school, public, or commercial
building, that person must be accredited to perform the asbestos inspection component of that activity. Conversely,
if a person is performing an environmental assessment or building inspection that does not include an asbestos inspection
component, that person does not require asbestos accreditation to perform that activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described earlier in Unit II.A.3. of this preamble, other specific exceptions to the inspection accreditation
requirement include; (1) persons performing periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b), (2)
compliance-related inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State or local government, and (3)
visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) for purposes of determining the completion of a response
action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response action
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Commenters overwhelmingly supported a definition for response action that would treat this term the same way both
for schools and for public and commercial buildings. EPA agrees with this approach because it provides regulatory
consistency between the MAP and the Schools Rule. Because many of the same contractors will be performing abatement
work in both schools and public and commercial buildings, the use of the same standard for both will further promote
comprehension of and compliance with the new accreditation requirements. The definition in the revised MAP is therefore
the same as that which appears in the Schools Rule. Consequently, if a response action were undertaken in a school,
and the same activity was then undertaken in a public or commercial building, both activities would be considered
response actions, and both activities would be required to engage the services of accredited workers unless specifically
excluded under the exemption for small-scale, short-duration activities. It should be noted, however, that there
are other aspects relating to the conduct of response actions which may be different for schools than for public and
commercial buildings. One example would be the requirements found at 40 CFR 763.90 for air clearance at the completion
of a response action which are applicable to such activities in schools but not in public and commercial buildings.

Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A majority of commenters supported the extension of the existing Schools Rule training exemption for SSSD work in
schools to public and commercial buildings (see 40 CFR 763, Appendix B to Subpart E). EPA agrees with the use of this
exemption in the revised MAP, because it both preserves regulatory consistency and promotes compliance with the
statute. Also, absent such a threshold exemption, a great many persons involved in operation and maintenance-type
activities in buildings would have to be specially trained, regardless of risk.

Major and minor fiber release episodes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A common theme among those commenting on the prospective incorporation of an SSSD exemption into the MAP was that
this concept lacked clarity, and was therefore difficult to interpret and apply. EPA is responding to this concern
in two ways. First, by using the existing SSSD exemption from the Schools Rule, the MAP will apply the same accreditation
exemption to all buildings (schools and public and commercial buildings) and thereby minimize any potential confusion
among the regulated community. Secondly, by adding the definitions of major and minor fiber release episodes, the
Agency is seeking to provide the clearest possible meaning to this exemption while keeping it entirely within the
framework established by the Schools Rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several State commenters expressed concern that an allowance of 180 days following their next legislative session
would not provide them with sufficient time to upgrade their programs in keeping with the increased training requirements
of ASHARA. Although EPA acknowledges the difficulties inherent with transitioning established State programs,
the changes were mandated by Congress when it enacted ASHARA. Furthermore, the relatively short timeframes established
in ASHARA for EPA to implement these training mandates clearly communicated a desire and intent for prompt action.
For these reasons, EPA believes that it is reasonable to allow States a comparable amount of time to come into compliance
with the revised MAP as had been allowed for under the original MAP. This provides each State with an allowance of 180
days following the convening of their next regular legislative session to adopt a State accreditation plan that is
no less stringent than the revised MAP. For some States with legislatures that meet every year, this means they will
have a period of time not less than 6 months in which to implement these changes. For other States whose legislatures
meet every other year, it means these States might have as long as 30 months to effect the changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training course upgrades
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters supported the 6&hyph;month compliance deadline for training course upgrades which EPA had proposed.
They also supported self-certification on the part of training entities as an efficient and practical way of quickly
implementing the new standards. Other commenters, however, contended that the 6&hyph;month deadline was either
too short or too long, and expressed concerns about the ability of EPA and/or the States to properly audit these upgraded
training programs. EPA considers the course upgrades prescribed in the revised MAP to be fully achievable within
a 6-month timeframe. The revisions directly affect only 3 of the 5 basic courses, and none of the refresher courses.
The initial worker and contractor/supervisor training courses must each incorporate 1 additional day of hands-on
training and the initial project designer courses must expand their curriculum to incorporate the 6 additional items
specified in the revisions. The original training provider self-certifications under ASHARA will be submitted
directly to EPA's Headquarter's Office in Washington, DC., so that this data can be quickly compiled at the national
level and integrated with existing data bases. This simplified and centralized process expedites course upgrades
to ensure that the new training courses will be widely available within a short period of time. EPA and/or the States
may then follow-up with field audits of these training programs as resources permit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accredited persons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Most commenters expressed support for the Agency's proposal to grandfather in all those persons who are in possession
of valid accreditation as of the day before the effective date of the revised MAP. Many also suggested that everyone
else should be allowed more than 6 months to obtain valid accreditation based upon the increased ASHARA training requirements.
In contrast, a few suggested that a transition period of less than 6 months would be sufficient. Because of the fairly
simple adjustments needed to upgrade training courses, and because EPA is providing an expedited procedure (through
self-certification) for purposes of obtaining course provider upgrade approval, the Agency considers the 6-month
deadline for obtaining new accreditation to be adequate. Persons who are already accredited on the date the revised
MAP takes effect are not directly impacted by it. Upon reaching their annual expiration date, they will take their
annual refresher training course, as before, and their accreditation will be extended for an additional year. Persons
seeking new accreditation on and after the effective date of the revised MAP, however, will need to complete either
an existing course that complies with the original MAP and thereby obtain provisional accreditation, or an upgraded
course that complies with the revised MAP to obtain regular accreditation. If a person takes an existing course, that
person will have to complete the upgraded training course within 6 months after the revised MAP takes effect in order
to sustain their accreditation and continue working. This provision helps ensure that anyone needing to obtain initial
accreditation during the period of transition between the original MAP and the revised MAP will have the opportunity
to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the MAP requirements for refresher training should also be increased along with
the basic requirements. This might be accomplished by either extending the length of mandatory refresher training,
or expanding its curriculum, or both. EPA does not agree with this position, however, and believes that actual work
experience is at least equivalent to requiring additional hands-on training as a basis for reaccreditation. At the
time of refresher training, most accredited persons should have already acquired on-the-job experience at least
equivalent to what this refresher hands-on training might otherwise provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Distinct Training Disciplines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a majority of commenters agreed with the general principle of separate training courses, many also believed
that an exception should be made in the case of combined worker/supervisor training. These parties pointed to the
common elements in the prescribed training curricula for these two disciplines as the primary reason for allowing
joint training. In this view, workers and supervisors would attend the same course, with the contractor/supervisors
coming back for 1 additional day of training after the worker curriculum had been completed. Although EPA permitted
this accomodation for a period of time under the original MAP, the Agency has now decided that, in light of the Congressional
mandate to strengthen and improve asbestos-related training programs, contractor/supervisors may no longer obtain
accreditation by attending the same training course as workers with a 1 day add-on. Contractor/supervisors have
markedly different job functions and responsibilities than workers. While many training elements are common to
these two disciplines, each discipline requires presentation at a different degree of complexity and level of detail,
depending upon whether a person is in training to become a worker, or in training to become a supervisor. An on-site
foreman, unlike a worker, must know how each of the workers should perform his/her individual assigned tasks, and
must also comprehend the total job to be done. As a result, a contractor/supervisor requires more in-depth training
on each of the training elements than does a worker. By way of illustration, ``regulatory review'' is one curriculum
training element that is common to both the worker and the supervisor courses. Where a worker must have a general understanding
of the bounds established by asbestos regulations, the supervisor, as the on-site person responsible for regulatory
compliance, must have a much greater depth of knowledge regarding these rules and the methods of complying. If supervisors
attend the same training course as workers, and are provided the same lecture on ``regulatory review,'' not only is
it likely that the workers in this class will get more regulatory training than they need (and possibly less of something
else more relevant to their jobs), but more importantly, the supervisors will not get the right mix of subject matter
depth and breadth. EPA believes, therefore, that the best way to ensure that contractor/supervisors receive the
specialized training they need is to keep their training courses separate and distinct from those of workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes, however, that it is permissible to allow an accredited contractor/supervisor to perform in the role
of an accredited worker without possessing separate worker accreditation. Separate worker accreditation is unnecessary
because the contractor/supervisor must essentially know all that the worker knows and more, and the contractor/supervisor
has also completed more training than the worker (5 days as opposed to 4 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation is different, however, with respect to dual accreditation for contractor/supervisors and project
designers. Because these two training disciplines share little in common, EPA is now eliminating the original MAP
provision whereby persons completing contractor/supervisor initial training could obtain dual accreditation
to work as both contractor/supervisors and project designers. After the effective date of the revisions, all persons
must take separate initial and refresher training that is specific to their discipline in order to obtain or retain
valid accreditation.

D. Increased Training Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA had solicited public comment on the number of additional hours of training that would be appropriate for the revised
MAP because ASHARA had left this amount unspecified. Whereas commenters suggested a variety of ways in which this
might be accomplished, many expressed support for EPA's proposal to require one additional 8&hyph;hour day of hands-on
training for the worker and the contractor/supervisor initial training courses respectively. The length of all
other training courses is not affected by the revisions. There are a number of distinct advantages to EPA's approach:
(1) All MAP training courses would be limited in length to no more than one 5&hyph;day business week, a period of time
adequate to accomplish the requisite training, (2) existing training course materials would remain relevant and
not require extensive modifications, (3) additional hands-on training should appropriately be given to those persons
who actually perform hands-on abatement work (i.e., workers and contractor/supervisors), and (4) the addition
of 8 hours of hands-on training (on top of 6 hours that are already required) should be relatively simple for providers
to achieve, yet affords them a degree of flexibility in deciding how to go about doing it (i.e., in selecting the particular
hands-on activities to be practiced or exercised). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters with experience in training, representing, or employing asbestos workers agreed that 8 additional
hours of hands-on training for workers and contractor/supervisors was advisable. They noted that the additional
day of training was necessary to allow workers to practice their jobs under actual working conditions, to gain necessary
experience in performing tasks such as erecting and dismantling containment barriers, glovebagging, and scaffolding,
and in working inside containment areas, or while wearing personal protective equipment, or in other common workplace
situations (see OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;016 and C1&hyph;020). Commenters also noted that the additional
day of hands-on training would help acclimatize workers without risk of exposure, and also would eliminate complaints
regarding the need for on-the-job training (OPPTS Docket 62107, Log Nos. C1&hyph;020 and C1&hyph;064).

E. Expanded Project Designer Curriculum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of commenters agreed with EPA's proposal to broaden the prescribed project designer training curriculum
to include six additional lecture elements without extending the minimum required length of the course. The six elements
have therefore been added, and include: (1) The need for, and methods of preparing a written project design, (2) techniques
for completing an initial cleaning of the work area, (3) increased emphasis on the rationale behind establishment
of functional spaces, (4) the need for written diagrams and methods of diagraming all containment barriers, (5) the
need for a written sampling rationale for air clearance, and (6) clarification of what constitutes a complete visual
inspection. These revisions have each been incorporated as additions to the initial project designer training curriculum.
They will improve the effectiveness of the accredited training programs, and thereby help to ensure that project
designers will be fully prepared to perform work in both schools and public and commercial buildings.

F. Withdrawal of Accreditation and Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Broad support also was expressed for EPA's proposal to incorporate minimum Federal criteria for proceedings relating
to the deaccreditation of persons and the withdrawal of approval from accredited training courses, and to adopt standardized
procedures for such actions. These changes had been proposed to: (1) Promote greater consistency and predictability
nationwide, and (2) clarify the manner by which EPA might directly deaccredit individuals or training courses without
reliance upon State authority or activity. The criteria have therefore been promulgated as minimum Federal criteria
which the States must match or exceed in their own programs. The procedures govern EPA activities only; the States
being left free to adhere to their own internal administrative procedures pursuant to State law.

G. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that a records retention period longer than 3 years would be preferable for compliance
verification purposes. EPA, however, consistent with other TSCA recordkeeping requirements (i.e., 40 CFR 704.11
and 761.180), regards a minimum 3&hyph;year retention period as adequate for this purpose, and appropriate when
consideration is given to the costs associated with records maintenance. These 3 years are adequate to ensure that
records will be available for anyone who needs to verify either initial or refesher accreditation status. Even if
a person obtained initial accreditation, and then took advantage of a full 12&hyph;month grace period before obtaining
refresher training, the 3&hyph;year retention requirement would ensure that the training provider has the records
to verify the initial accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of training providers also expressed concerns about access; surmising that if their records were opened
in an unrestricted manner to the public, that such providers would become vulnerable to burdensome or harrassing
requests. They did not object, however, to training provider records being open to EPA and the States (see OPPTS Docket
No. 62107, Log No. D1-001). EPA accepts this position, and it has been incorporated into the revisions (see Unit I.F.6.
of the revised MAP). This would not preclude the public from seeking information directly from the training provider
through telephone inquiries or requests, but would permit training schools to maintain a measure of flexibility
in responding to inquiries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also had asked for comments about whether training providers should be required to verify the accreditation status
of students enrolling in their courses. In reply, several training entities commented that this could present a significant
burden that should not be imposed (OPPTS Docket 62107, Log Nos. C1-019 and C1-041). After considering this information,
EPA agrees, and the revised MAP includes a recommendation rather than a requirement that training entities verify
the accreditation status of students enrolling in their courses. Regarding the more general question of whether
or not recordkeeping requirements should be imposed, many commenters acknowledged the need for this action and expressed
support for EPA's position.

H. Accreditation Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While most commenters expressed support for EPA's proposal to require additional training provider information
on accreditation certificates (i.e., issuer's name, address, and telephone number), a few suggested that other
items might be required as well, including the name of the course instructor and the photograph, social security number,
and signature of the person to whom accreditation is being conferred. The Agency does not consider these other items
to be necessary on certificates, because the same information is generally available through other sources. The
names of course instructors are otherwise provided through the recordkeeping requirements contained in the revisions,
and personal identification items such as photographs, social security numbers, and signatures are commonly available
on the professional licenses issued by State programs.

Project monitor training and accreditation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several parties indicated that EPA should expand the MAP to include mandatory accreditation for a sixth training
discipline, that of ``Project Monitor.'' The functional role of a project monitor is often specific to a particular
response action; but generally might include: (1) Monitoring a response action for compliance with contract/job
specifications and regulatory requirements, (2) performing visual audits of a job site before, during and after
a response action is undertaken, and (3) performing air monitoring as a part of a response action or for purposes of
clearing a response action. Depending upon the particular mix of activities undertaken by the project monitor, this
person might otherwise require accreditation, particularly if they somehow become directly involved in conducting
any part of the response action. Typically, however, the project monitor is an agent or employee representing a building
owner or manager who is engaged to oversee a contractor's performance of a response action in a school or public or commercial
building. These commenters argue that because such persons are already widely used, steps should be taken to ensure
a minimum level of competency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA did not grant the Agency a clear mandate to enlarge the scope of federal accreditation to include additional
training disciplines. Furthermore, implementing this course would necessitate more extensive changes to State
programs and statutes, a consequence which would hinder State efforts to comply with ASHARA. For these reasons, EPA
has incorporated a recommended training curriculum for such persons into the revised MAP and is urging States to consider
adopting this curriculum for purposes of requiring project monitor accreditation under State law or regulation.
Such State laws would not mandate that project monitors be used in every instance, but rather, would require their
accreditation whenever a building owner or manager elected to employ the services of a project monitor. This curriculum
was developed in 1992 through a roundtable discussion which involved numerous affected interests outside of EPA.
The document which emerged from this process, entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whitepaper on the Development and Implementation of Asbestos Abatement Project Monitor Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (March 20, 1992), outlined a recommended 5&hyph;day training program. Even where States choose not to require accreditation
under their State Plans for such persons, EPA recommends that training entities consider offering this course, and
suggests that professionals working in this capacity seek out and obtain this or equivalent training.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operations and maintenance training and accreditation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A few commenters suggested that persons responsible for SSSD operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) activity involving
ACBM should be subject to MAP training and accreditation requirements. They noted that while &sect;763.92(a) of
the Schools Rule requires school maintenance personnel to take special ``awareness'' training, and, in some instances,
additional O&amp;M training, the MAP would not require training for all maintenance personnel in public and commercial
buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This difference in training requirements is based upon the statutory training scheme that Congress established
in Title II of TSCA. Both the language of the statute, and the legislative history of AHERA and ASHARA support EPA's
decision not to require MAP accreditation for all O&amp;M personnel in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Congress enacted AHERA in 1986, it required MAP training and accreditation for persons who conducted response
actions, but excluded certain types of O&amp;M activities from the MAP training requirement (15 U.S.C. 2643(f),
2644(c), and 2646(a)(3)). It also required EPA to promulgate rules to regulate O&amp;M programs in schools, and required
local education agencies to develop and implement O&amp;M plans, and to provide for the education of service and maintenance
personnel with respect to asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA promulgated the Schools Rule pursuant to AHERA. The Schools Rule does not require full MAP training and accreditation
for all O&amp;M workers, but does require it for any person in a school who: (a) Conducts a response action other than
a SSSD activity (40 CFR 763.90(g)); (b) performs a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM, other than a SSSD
activity (40 CFR 763.91(e)); or (c) conducts a response action for a major fiber release episode (40 CFR 763.91(f)(2)(iii)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Schools Rule requires less extensive training for O&amp;M school employees that are not performing
an activity that falls within one of the three categories (40 CFR 763.92(a)). This last category of O&amp;M employee
does not have to be accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, in 1988, Congress amended AHERA, and created a new provision of TSCA, section 215, specifically to
codify the O&amp;M training requirements of the Schools Rule (15 U.S.C. 2655). Now, TSCA section 215 requires ``proper
training'' for school employees who conduct O&amp;M activities in a school (15 U.S.C. 2655(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Congress further modified TSCA asbestos training requirements when it enacted ASHARA. Congress expanded
the MAP training requirements to cover persons working in public and commercial buildings, but it did not require
MAP training and accreditation for all persons who perform O&amp;M activities in such buildings. First, Congress
left intact the original language in TSCA section 206(a) that exempts many persons who conduct O&amp;M response actions
from MAP training and accreditation requirements in both schools and public and commercial buildings (15 U.S.C.
2646(a)(3)). In the second place, Congress chose not to expand the coverage of TSCA section 215 and require limited
training for O&amp;M employees in public and commercial buildings. Finally, unlike the original AHERA that governs
schools, Congress did not require EPA to promulgate rules regulating O&amp;M programs in public and commercial buildings,
nor did it require employers in such buildings to provide for the education of service and maintenance personnel with
respect to asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with these Congressional actions, EPA has not required MAP training and accreditation for every O&amp;M
worker in public and commercial buildings. Rather, the revised MAP requires MAP accreditation where O&amp;M workers
are most at risk. O&amp;M personnel must obtain MAP accreditation when conducting a response action, including a
maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM, unless that activity is a SSSD activity, or when conducting a response
action for a major fiber release.

Management plans for public and commercial buildings

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A few commenters, noting that ASHARA section 15(a) specifically omitted management planners from the accredited
disciplines being extended to public and commercial buildings, suggested that management plans should otherwise
be required for such buildings. Although EPA, consistent with its manage-in-place policy articulated in the ``Green
Book'' guidance (see

Managing Asbestos In Place: A Building Owner's Guide to Operations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-Containing
Materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA No. 20T&hyph;2003, July 1990), considers management plans to be helpful tools in preventing asbestos exposures,
the Agency is not requiring management plans for regulated buildings in this revision. ASHARA did authorize EPA to
establish training standards for asbestos workers, but it did not authorize the Agency to require public and commercial
building owners to conduct asbestos-related work in a particular fashion. However, for those regulated public and
commercial buildings where asbestos-related problems are identified through inspections, EPA strongly recommends
that plans be prepared for how to address these issues. EPA's Green Book should prove to be a useful reference in this
respect. The Agency would also suggest that accredited management planners be engaged for purposes of developing
such plans to ensure their adequacy.

. Several commenters expressed concerns about the prospective quality of analytical work to be performed with respect
to public and commercial buildings, noting that EPA's announcement of additions and changes under consideration
had not mentioned the use of accredited laboratories for the analysis of bulk and/or air samples taken from such buildings.
TSCA section 206(d) provides for the establishment of the National Institute of Standards and Technology National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), and stipulates that only laboratories accredited under this
program will be allowed to conduct analyses of asbestos bulk and air samples taken from school buildings under the
authority of local education agencies (15 U.S.C. 2646(d)). But Congress did not extend this same requirement to the
analysis of bulk or air samples taken from regulated public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA strongly recommends that these samples be analyzed by NVLAP-accredited laboratories because these laboratories
have undergone Federal evaluation and testing and have met stringent performance standards. Further, EPA urges
that asbestos abatement site air be analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) prior to building reoccupancy
in a manner consistent with 40 CFR 763.90 (i)(3) and (4). This position is in keeping with EPA's on-going activity in
schools where the allowance for the use of phase contrast microscopy (PCM) has been greatly diminished. EPA strongly
recommends that abatement site air clearance samples collected from public and commercial buildings be analyzed
by TEM at NVLAP-accredited laboratories. EPA now considers the technically superior TEM analysis to be both economical
and widely available. TEM is technically superior to PCM because it is capable of measuring all asbestos fibers including
those thin fibers not measured by PCM; therefore, TEM is the more stringent analytical tool to be used for analysis
of airborne asbestos during abatement site air clearance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Instructor qualifications
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters were of the opinion that EPA had not gone far enough in establishing minimum qualifications for training
course instructors. The original MAP stipulated that instructors needed to have academic training or field experience
in asbestos abatement, yet allowed State programs to adopt their own more stringent qualification standards. Since
promulgation of the original MAP, many States have elected to institute their own instructor qualification requirements,
a fact which would now complicate any Federal effort to retroactively establish new minimum standards. EPA considers
this to be an issue best left to the States to decide. So long as course instructors demonstrate relevant training and
experience, and the knowledge and ability to provide effective instruction in the prescribed curriculum, EPA will
continue to view such persons as meeting minimum standards. States are encouraged, however, to review this issue
as they upgrade their programs in keeping with ASHARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related issue had also been raised independently by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in a May 1991, Report to Congress
entitled ``EPA's Asbestos Accreditation Program Requirements Need Strengthening.'' In this report, GAO had recommended
that EPA assess, in conjunction with its MAP revision, the need for requiring individuals working in the asbestos
professions to meet prequalification and experience standards. Although EPA responded to this comment by reevaluating
this issue and discussing it with affected organizations, the fact that at least 17 States had already adopted widely
varying prequalification standards posed a potentially significant obstacle (Source: State Asbestos Programs
Related to AHERA; A Survey of State Laws and Regulations. National Conference of State Legislatures. September,
1992) (OPPTS Docket No. 62107, Log No. B1&hyph;024). These States had established their own prequalification standards
for asbestos control professionals in response to EPA's earlier recommendation (contained in the original MAP)
that they should consider doing so. Consequently, any action by EPA to retroactively impose new Federal minimum standards
would add to the cost and difficulty of transitioning these State Programs into compliance with the revised MAP. Such
an outcome would not be helpful in promoting ASHARA's objective to achieve a decentralized program administered
by the 50 States. For this reason, EPA decided not to require new minimum prequalification standards in the revised
MAP. Nonetheless, in support of this goal, EPA has increased its experience requirements through incorporation
of an additional day of hands-on training in both the initial worker and contractor/supervisor training programs,
and is renewing/continuing its recommendation that States adopt other appropriate prequalification standards
of their own.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foreign language courses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several commenters suggested the need for specific requirements or accomodations for foreign language courses,
citing the significant numbers of non-English speaking persons who are now seeking accredited training. EPA policy
permits approved worker training courses in languages other than English so long as the course instruction, all of
the course materials, and the course examination are each presented in the same foreign language. Given the lack of
a uniform distribution of non-English speaking persons nationwide, with different languages prevailing in different
regions of the country, the MAP will continue to allow States to adopt their own standards and procedures in this regard
to address their individual and unique circumstances. EPA does, however, urge States to address these issues, and
to accomodate the needs of their respective non-English speaking populations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters remarked that the use of standardized forms for purposes of inspection reports and management plans
would not only contribute to greater consistency and professionalism among accredited persons working with these
tools, but might also facilitate the development of reciprocal arrangements between State programs. EPA agrees
with these comments, and has incorporated specific recommendations into the training curricula for both inspectors
and management planners which are aimed at promoting greater usage of standardized forms. EPA recommends that States
consider the utility of adopting requirements for the use of standardized forms as an integral part of their asbestos
regulatory programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal recognition of State programs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several State commenters indicated that it is beneficial for a State to formally apply for and obtain Federal recognition
of its accreditation plan. TSCA Title II specifically requires States to adopt accreditation plans that are no less
stringent than the MAP, but does not require them to obtain formal EPA approval. Even though EPA approval is not statutorily
required, it is beneficial. Where a State adopts and implements an accreditation program but does not obtain EPA approval,
it is difficult for the industry and other States to determine whether such a State program complies with minimum Federal
requirements and thus has the authority to issue TSCA accreditation. Where a person obtains a license from an unrecognized
State, that person's credentials may not be readily accepted by an employer, a contractor, or another State in which
the person might seek to find work, because absent EPA's approval, there is uncertainty about whether such a person
is properly accredited. In contrast, EPA's approval of a State effectively resolves all of this uncertainty. EPA
agrees with these comments, and strongly recommends that all States seek formal EPA approval of their accreditation
programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Grace period for accreditation reinstatement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Other comments were received regarding whether there should be a ``grace period'' during which a person can complete
refresher training within 12 months of their certificate expiration date and have their accreditation reinstated.
Such a person would not be required to retake the full initial training program for that discipline. Some States expressed
support for this approach, while one suggested there should be a penalty for persons who fail to obtain their refresher
training on-time (i.e., before the certificate expiration date). EPA believes that the 12&hyph;month grace period
is appropriate. If a person takes their refresher training too early in their accreditation year, they are penalized
through a shortening of what would otherwise be a 12&hyph;month period. If they are unable to enroll in a refresher
course precisely when they need it, at a location which is convenient, the grace period allows them the opportunity
to take the course at a later, more convenient time. During the 12&hyph;month grace period, however, it should be emphasized
that the person is not accredited, and may not otherwise perform the work that requires accreditation until they complete
their refresher training. EPA views this as being a sufficient penalty for not obtaining the required refresher training
in a timely manner. Because the 12&hyph;month grace period has proven helpful to the industry, and effective in preserving
a sizeable, accredited workforce nationwide, the Agency plans to not only continue this procedure, but also to encourage
States to adopt it for their programs as well. Consequently, the revised MAP now contains a formal recommendation
that State programs take this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accreditation program adoption by the U.S. Department of Defense
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In commenting on EPA's proposed changes to the MAP, the Department of the Navy noted that it operates its own in-house
asbestos training program which it believes complies with the accreditation requirements of the MAP. For this reason,
the Navy suggested that EPA might formally review and approve the Navy's training program so that Defense Department
employees could become accredited through the Defense program, and therefore not need separate accreditation from
a State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA requires accreditation for all persons who perform certain types of asbestos-related work in public and commercial
buildings, and defines that type of building very broadly. As a result, EPA has concluded that Federal employees who
perform inspections or design or conduct response actions in government buildings must be accredited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 203(l) of TSCA, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to act in lieu of a State Governor with respect
to any school operated under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 (20 U.S.C. 921 et seq.). This authority
allows the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to adopt its own accreditation program no less stringent than the
EPA MAP for the purpose of accrediting Defense Department employees performing asbestos-related work in these schools.
Although this might be accomplished in cooperation with EPA, the statute does not make the validity of the Defense
Department's plan for schools contingent upon EPA approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASHARA, however, did not extend this accreditation authority given to the Secretary of Defense to cover Defense Department
employees performing asbestos-related work in public and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the Navy's in-house training courses, the Navy may apply for approval of its training courses in the
same manner as any other training provider. This would permit the Navy to accredit any of its employees who might complete
these approved training courses. However, because EPA is no longer accepting new courses for review and contingent
approval (see 54 FR 38802), only those States with accreditation programs no less stringent than the MAP are in a position
to grant approval for such courses.

IV. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory impact analysis estimates the costs and benefits attributable to this regulation. Because this regulation
is an amendment to a current regulation, the costs and benefits are incremental, estimating the additional effect
of the regulation with respect to the current regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with this regulation are quantified; the benefits are discussed in qualitative terms and are
expected to be of significant importance. EPA believes this rule achieves the benefits mandated by Congress at a modest
cost. The rule affects training providers, asbestos workers, asbestos abatement and inspection companies, building
owners, general building workers and occupants, State governments, and the Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits associated with this rule involve reductions in exposure to asbestos fibers due to the use of knowledgeable
individuals to work with asbestos and the use of safer work practices. The increased training requirements are expected
to increase the knowledge of the trained individuals. The population most affected by this regulation is the asbestos
professionals engaged in inspections and abatements, of which there are about 200,000 individuals who are required
to be trained under this regulation for work in public and commercial buildings. These individuals are expected to
benefit the most from this regulation due to the amount of time spent working with ACBM. EPA estimates that there are
0.4 to 1.2 million public and commercial buildings with ACBM, in which there are between 14 and 43 million employees
and workers who will gain a greater degree of protection either through the use of trained contractors or their own
education. Other employees and building occupants will gain a greater degree of protection through the use of appropriate
and correctly applied work practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with this rule are well documented. Upgrading courses, retaining records, and allowing access
to records increase costs for training providers. Most of these costs are passed through in the form of higher charges
for the courses that are offered. In the first year, EPA estimates that the overall increase in course costs would be
between $2.3 million and $14.2 million. Training provider burden for recordkeeping and allowing access to their
records would be $200,000 to $250,000 for the first year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training providers estimate that 70 percent of the asbestos-related abatement work done in public and commercial
buildings already uses trained individuals. An analysis of the supply and demand of accredited asbestos professionals
in each of the four disciplines extended to public and commercial buildings illustrates that the national supply
is sufficient to accommodate the anticipated demand. Early estimates of supply and demand for project designers
suggested a potential for shortfall, and this conclusion provided a basis for delaying implementation of this rule
(57 FR 1913, January 16, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule requires the owners of public and commercial buildings to utilize accredited workers to inspect for ACBM,
and to design and carry-out response actions with respect to friable ACBM, unless exempted under the SSSD threshold.
EPA believes that most building owners will elect to hire outside contractors rather than train their own people to
comply with this requirement, resulting in an annual cost of $2 million to $45 million for the estimated 374,000 to
1.23 million buildings which will be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both State and Federal governments incur costs due to this rule. For the first year, State governments incur a cost
of just under $4 million, while EPA incurs a cost of between $70,000 and $130,000. These costs are due to updating and
reviewing State programs and reapproving training courses. Overall costs for the first year for this rule are estimated
to be between $8 million and $64 million. These costs are summarized below. Discounting over a 20&hyph;year period
at 7 percent yields a present value cost estimate between $33 million and $458 million.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f),
the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities
(also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering
with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal
or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Administrator certifies that this revised rule
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Virtually all of the States already
have some type of asbestos certification program now in effect. Nationwide, many thousands of persons are presently
completing accredited training programs each year. A discussion of EPA's analysis of the economic consequences
of this interim final rule appears in Unit IV. of this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing such approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information requires training providers and States to respond. For training providers, public
reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average 42 hours per response. This includes the time
for reviewing the regulation, making required changes to training programs, preparing and submitting a self-certification
package, maintaining records, and providing access to those records. There is no recordkeeping burden associated
with maintaining the records as their maintenance is usual and customary business practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For States, public reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average 402 hours per response. This
includes the time for reviewing the regulation, comparing the new requirements with the current State program, completing
any necessary regulatory or legislative analysis, adopting new legislation or regulations, preparing and submitting
an application for program approval, and implementing an updated State program. For States, there is no recordkeeping
burden associated with this collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of Appendix C: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. ``Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)'' means any material containing more than one percent asbestos
which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a building,
which when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable
asbestos-containing material after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when
dry it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``Friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM)'' means any friable ACM that is in or on interior structural
members or other parts of a school or public and commercial building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. ``Inspection'' means an activity undertaken in a school building, or a public and commercial building, to determine
the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable asbestos-containing building material
(ACBM) or suspected ACBM, whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. This
term includes reinspections of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified.
The term does not include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b) solely for the purpose of recording or reporting
a change in the condition of known or assumed ACBM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State, or local government solely for the purpose of determining
compliance with applicable statutes or regulations; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) solely for the purpose of determining completion of
response actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. ``Major fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible
emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. ``Minor fiber release episode'' means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible
emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear feet or less of friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. ``Public and commercial building'' means the interior space of any building which is not a school building, except
that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units or detached single-family
homes. The term includes, but is not limited to: industrial and office buildings, residential apartment buildings
and condominiums of 10 or more dwelling units, government-owned buildings, colleges, museums, airports, hospitals,
churches, preschools, stores, warehouses and factories. Interior space includes exterior hallways connecting
buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems used to condition interior space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. ``Response action'' means a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure, repair, and operation and
maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. ``Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)'' are tasks such as, but not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing insulation on beams or above ceilings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Installation or removal of a small section of drywall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended
as asbestos abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Removal of asbestos-containing thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be
contained in a single glove bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing wallboard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only if required in the
performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement. Such work
may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure. Such an
enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended
containment function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Initial Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training requirements for purposes of accreditation are specified both in terms of required subjects of instruction
and in terms of length of training. Each initial training course has a prescribed curriculum and number of days of training.
One day of training equals 8 hours, including breaks and lunch. Course instruction must be provided by EPA or State-approved
instructors. EPA or State instructor approval shall be based upon a review of the instructor's academic credentials
and/or field experience in asbestos abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the initial training requirements, individual States may wish to consider requiring additional days of training
for purposes of supplementing hands-on activities or for reviewing relevant state regulations. States also may
wish to consider the relative merits of a worker apprenticeship program. Further, they might consider more stringent
minimum qualification standards for the approval of training instructors. EPA recommends that the enrollment in
any given course be limited to 25 students so that adequate opportunities exist for individual hands-on experience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States have the option to provide initial training directly or approve other entities to offer training. The following
requirements are for the initial training of persons required to have accreditation under TSCA Title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training requirements for each of the five accredited disciplines are outlined below. Persons in each discipline
perform a different job function and distinct role. Inspectors identify and assess the condition of ACBM, or suspect
ACBM. Management planners use data gathered by inspectors to assess the degree of hazard posed by ACBM in schools to
determine the scope and timing of appropriate response actions needed for schools. Project designers determine
how asbestos abatement work should be conducted. Lastly, workers and contractor/supervisors carry out and oversee
abatement work. In addition, a recommended training curriculum is also presented for a sixth discipline, which is
not federally-accredited, that of ``Project Monitor.'' Each accredited discipline and training curriculum is
separate and distinct from the others. A person seeking accreditation in any of the five accredited MAP disciplines
cannot attend two or more courses concurrently, but may attend such courses sequentially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several instances, initial training courses for a specific discipline (e.g., workers, inspectors) require hands-on
training. For asbestos abatement contractor/supervisors and workers, hands-on training should include working
with asbestos-substitute materials, fitting and using respirators, use of glovebags, donning protective clothing,
and constructing a decontamination unit as well as other abatement work activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Workers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person must be accredited as a worker to carry out any of the following activities with respect to friable ACBM in a
school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2) a maintenance activity
that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber release episode. All
persons seeking accreditation as asbestos abatement workers shall complete at least a 4&hyph;day training course
as outlined below. The 4&hyph;day worker training course shall include lectures, demonstrations, at least 14 hours
of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and an examination. Hands-on training
must permit workers to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos abatement. A person who
is otherwise accredited as a contractor/supervisor may perform in the role of a worker without possessing separate
accreditation as a worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of cultural diversity associated with the asbestos workforce, EPA recommends that States adopt specific
standards for the approval of foreign language courses for abatement workers. EPA further recommends the use of audio-visual
materials to complement lectures, where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

as a building owner's representative to ensure that abatement work is completed according to specification and in
compliance with all relevant statutes and regulations. They may also perform the vital role of air monitoring for
purposes of determining final clearance. EPA recommends that a State seeking to accredit individuals as project
monitors consider adopting a minimum 5&hyph;day training course covering the topics outlined below. The course
outlined below consists of lectures and demonstrations, at least 6 hours of hands-on training, course review, and
a written examination. The hands-on training component might be satisfied by having the student simulate participation
in or performance of any of the relevant job functions or activities (or by incorporation of the workshop component
described in item ``n'' below of this unit).

C. Examinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each State shall administer a closed book examination or designate other entities such as State-approved providers
of training courses to administer the closed-book examination to persons seeking accreditation who have completed
an initial training course. Demonstration testing may also be included as part of the examination. A person seeking
initial accreditation in a specific discipline must pass the examination for that discipline in order to receive
accreditation. For example, a person seeking accreditation as an abatement project designer must pass the State's
examination for abatement project designer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may develop their own examinations, have providers of training courses develop examinations, or use standardized
examinations developed for purposes of accreditation under TSCA Title II. In addition, States may supplement standardized
examinations with questions about State regulations. States may obtain commercially developed standardized examinations,
develop standardized examinations independently, or do so in cooperation with other States, or with commercial
or non-profit providers on a regional or national basis. EPA recommends the use of standardized, scientifically-validated
testing instruments, which may be beneficial in terms of both promoting competency and in fostering accreditation
reciprocity between States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each examination shall adequately cover the topics included in the training course for that discipline. Each person
who completes a training course, passes the required examination, and fulfills whatever other requirements the
State imposes must receive an accreditation certificate in a specific discipline. Whether a State directly issues
accreditation certificates, or authorizes training providers to issue accreditation certificates, each certificate
issued to an accredited person must contain the following minimum information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A unique certificate number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Name of accredited person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Discipline of the training course completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Dates of the training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Date of the examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. An expiration date of 1 year after the date upon which the person successfully completed the course and examination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The name, address, and telephone number of the training provider that issued the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. A statement that the person receiving the certificate has completed the requisite training for asbestos accreditation
under TSCA Title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States or training providers who reaccredit persons based upon completion of required refresher training must also
provide accreditation certificates with all of the above information, except the examination date may be omitted
if a State does not require a refresher examination for reaccreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a State licenses accredited persons but has authorized training providers to issue accreditation certificates,
the State may issue licenses in the form of photo-identification cards. Where this applies, EPA recommends that the
State licenses should include all of the same information required for the accreditation certificates. A State may
also choose to issue photo-identification cards in addition to the required accreditation certificates. Accredited
persons must have their initial and current accreditation certificates at the location where they are conducting
work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The following are the requirements for examination in each discipline: a. Worker: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 50 multiple-choice questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Continuing Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For all disciplines, a State's accreditation program shall include annual refresher training as a requirement for
reaccreditation as indicated below: 1. Workers: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contractor/Supervisors: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inspectors: One half-day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Management Planners: One half-day of inspector refresher training and one half-day of refresher training for
management planners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Project Designers: One full day of refresher training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refresher courses shall be specific to each discipline. Refresher courses shall be conducted as separate and
distinct courses and not combined with any other training during the period of the refresher course. For each discipline,
the refresher course shall review and discuss changes in Federal, State, and local regulations, developments in
state-of-the-art procedures, and a review of key aspects of the initial training course as determined by the State.
After completing the annual refresher course, persons shall have their accreditation extended for an additional
year from the date of the refresher course. A State may consider requiring persons to pass reaccreditation examinations
at specific intervals (for example, every 3 years). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends that States formally establish a 12-month grace period to enable formerly accredited persons with
expired certificates to complete refresher training and have their accreditation status reinstated without having
to re-take the initial training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requiring training and an examination, a State may require candidates for accreditation to meet other
qualification and/or experience standards that the State considers appropriate for some or all disciplines. States
may choose to consider requiring qualifications similar to the examples outlined below for inspectors, management
planners and project designers. States may modify these examples as appropriate. In addition, States may want to
include some requirements based on experience in performing a task directly as a part of a job or in an apprenticeship
role. They may also wish to consider additional criteria for the approval of training course instructors beyond those
prescribed by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Inspectors: Qualifications - possess a high school diploma. States may want to require an Associate's Degree in
specific fields (e.g., environmental or physical sciences). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Management Planners: Qualifications - Registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist or
related scientific field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Project Designers: Qualifications - registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Asbestos Training Course Instructor: Qualifications - academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos
abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recommends that States prescribe minimum qualification standards for training instructors employed by training
providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All approved providers of accredited asbestos training courses must comply with the following minimum recordkeeping
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Training course materials. A training provider must retain copies of all instructional materials used in the delivery
of the classroom training such as student manuals, instructor notebooks and handouts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Instructor qualifications. A training provider must retain copies of all instructors' resumes, and the documents
approving each instructor issued by either EPA or a State. Instructors must be approved by either EPA or a State before
teaching courses for accreditation purposes. A training provider must notify EPA or the State, as appropriate, in
advance whenever it changes course instructors. Records must accurately identify the instructors that taught each
particular course for each date that a course is offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Examinations. A training provider must document that each person who receives an accreditation certificate for
an initial training course has achieved a passing score on the examination. These records must clearly indicate the
date upon which the exam was administered, the training course and discipline for which the exam was given, the name
of the person who proctored the exam, a copy of the exam, and the name and test score of each person taking the exam. The
topic and dates of the training course must correspond to those listed on that person's accreditation certificate.
States may choose to apply these same requirements to examinations for refresher training courses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accreditation certificates. The training providers or States, whichever issues the accreditation certificate,
shall maintain records that document the names of all persons who have been awarded certificates, their certificate
numbers, the disciplines for which accreditation was conferred, training and expiration dates, and the training
location. The training provider or State shall maintain the records in a manner that allows verification by telephone
of the required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Verification of certificate information. EPA recommends that training providers of refresher training courses
confirm that their students possess valid accreditation before granting course admission. EPA further recommends
that training providers offering the initial management planner training course verify that students have met the
prerequisite of possessing valid inspector accreditation at the time of course admission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Records retention and access. (a) The training provider shall maintain all required records for a minimum of 3 years.
The training provider, however, may find it advantageous to retain these records for a longer period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The training provider must allow reasonable access to all of the records required by the MAP, and to any other records
which may be required by States for the approval of asbestos training providers or the accreditation of asbestos training
courses, to both EPA and to State Agencies, on request. EPA encourages training providers to make this information
equally accessible to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a training provider ceases to conduct training, the training provider shall notify the approving government
body (EPA or the State) and give it the opportunity to take possession of that providers asbestos training records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Deaccreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. States must establish criteria and procedures for deaccrediting persons accredited as workers, contractor/supervisors,
inspectors, management planners, and project designers. States must follow their own administrative procedures
in pursuing deaccreditation actions. At a minimum, the criteria shall include: (a) Performing work requiring accreditation
at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current accreditation certificates; (b) Permitting
the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or (d) Obtaining accreditation from a training
provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State
that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may directly pursue deaccreditation actions without reliance on State deaccreditation or enforcement authority
or actions. In addition to the above-listed situations, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the accreditation
of persons who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or convicted under section 16 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C.
2615 or 2647, for violations of 40 CFR part 763, or section 113 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413, for violations of
40 CFR part 61, subpart M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Any person who performs asbestos work requiring accreditation under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a),
without such accreditation is in violation of TSCA. The following persons are not accredited for purposes of section
206(a) of TSCA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any person who obtains training documentation through fraudulent means; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any person who gains admission to and completes refresher training through fraudulent representation of initial
or previous refresher training documentation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such
as education, training, professional registration, or experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Reciprocity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recommends that each State establish reciprocal arrangements with other States that have established accreditation
programs that meet or exceed the requirements of the MAP. Such arrangements might address cooperation in licensing
determinations, the review and approval of training programs and/or instructors, candidate testing and exam administration,
curriculum development, policy formulation, compliance monitoring, and the exchange of information and data.
The benefits to be derived from these arrangements include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative
activity and the attainment of a more professional accredited workforce as States are able to refine and improve the
effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and methods of other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. EPA Approval Process for State Accreditation Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. States may seek approval for a single discipline or all disciplines as specified in the MAP. For example, a State
that currently only requires worker accreditation may receive EPA approval for that discipline alone. EPA encourages
States that currently do not have accreditation requirements for all disciplines required under section 206(b)(2)
of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2), to seek EPA approval for those disciplines the State does accredit. As States establish
accreditation requirements for the remaining disciplines, the requested information outlined below should be
submitted to EPA as soon as possible. Any State that had an accreditation program approved by EPA under an earlier version
of the MAP may follow the same procedures to obtain EPA approval of their accreditation program under this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Partial approval of a State Program for the accreditation of one or more disciplines does not mean that the State
is in full compliance with TSCA where the deadline for that State to have adopted a State Plan no less stringent than
the MAP has already passed. State Programs which are at least as stringent as the MAP for one or more of the accredited
disciplines may, however, accredit persons in those disciplines only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. States seeking EPA approval or reapproval of accreditation programs shall submit the following information to
the Regional Asbestos Coordinator at their EPA Regional office: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A copy of the legislation establishing or upgrading the State's accreditation program (if applicable). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A copy of the State's accreditation regulations or revised regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A letter to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator that clearly indicates how the State meets the program requirements
of this MAP. Addresses for each of the Regional Asbestos Coordinators are shown below:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals or groups wishing to sponsor training courses for disciplines required to be accredited under section
206(b)(1)(A) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A), may apply for approval from States that have accreditation program
requirements that are at least as stringent as this MAP. For a course to receive approval, it must meet the requirements
for the course as outlined in this MAP, and any other requirements imposed by the State from which approval is being
sought. Courses that have been approved by a State with an accreditation program at least as stringent as this MAP are
approved under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), for that particular State, and also for any other State that
does not have an accreditation program as stringent as this MAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Refresher Training Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following minimum information is required for approval of refresher training courses by States: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The length of training in half-days or days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The topics covered in the course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A copy of all course materials (student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts, etc.).

and pass the examination, if required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Withdrawal of Training Course Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
States must establish criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval from accredited training
programs. States should follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing actions for suspension or withdrawal
of approval of training programs. At a minimum, the criteria shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's approval by a State or EPA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to maintain requisite records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other accreditation information;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA MAP or State Accreditation Program, as
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the criteria listed above, EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval where an approved
training course instructor, or other person with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found
in violation of other asbestos regulations administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation,
or execution of a consent agreement and order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant
statutes or regulations. States may wish to adopt this criterion modified to include their own asbestos statutes
or regulations. EPA may also suspend or withdraw approval of training programs where a training provider has submitted
false information as a part of the self-certification required under Unit V.B. of the revised MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training course providers shall permit representatives of EPA or the State which approved their training courses
to attend, evaluate, and monitor any training course without charge. EPA or State compliance inspection staff are
not required to give advance notice of their inspections. EPA may suspend or withdraw State or EPA approval of a training
course based upon the criteria specified in this Unit III.C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. EPA Procedures for Suspension or Revocation of Accreditation or Training Course Approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. If the Administrator decides to suspend or revoke the accreditation of any person or suspend or withdraw the approval

c. Issue accreditation pursuant to an earlier version of the MAP that provisionally satisfies the requirement for
TSCA accreditation until October 4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a State may not approve new TSCA training course providers to conduct training or to issue TSCA accreditation
that satisfies the requirements of this MAP until the State adopts an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent
as this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but fails to adopt a plan as stringent as this MAP by the
deadline established in Unit V.A.1., is subject to the following after that deadline date: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The State loses any status it may have held as an EPA-approved State for accreditation purposes under section 206
of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All training course providers approved by the State lose State approval to conduct training and issue accreditation
that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Requirements applicable to Training Courses and Providers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As of October 4, 1994, an approved training provider must certify to EPA and to any State that has approved the provider
for TSCA accreditation, that each of the provider's training courses complies with the requirements of this MAP.
The written submission must document in specific detail the changes made to each training course in order to comply
with the requirements of this MAP and clearly state that the provider is also in compliance with all other requirements
of this MAP, including the new recordkeeping and certificate provisions. Each submission must include the following
statement signed by an authorized representative of the training provider: ``Under civil and criminal penalties
of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C.
2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable requirements of Title
II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to Subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal, state, or local requirements.''
A consolidated self-certification submission from each training provider that addresses all of its approved training
courses is permissible and encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The self-certification must be sent via registered mail, to EPA Headquarters at the following address: Attn. Self-Certification
Program, Field Programs Branch, Chemical Management Division (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics,
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A duplicate copy of the complete submission
must also be sent to any States from which approval had been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timely receipt of a complete self-certification by EPA and all approving States shall have the effect of extending
approval under this MAP to the training courses offered by the submitting provider. If a self-certification is not
received by the approving government bodies on or before the due date, the affected training course is not approved
under this MAP. Such training providers must then reapply for approval of these training courses pursuant to the procedures
outlined in Unit III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Requirements applicable to Accredited Persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons accredited by a State with an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or
by an EPA-approved training provider as of April 3, 1994, are accredited in accordance with the requirements of this
MAP, and are not required to retake initial training. They must continue to comply with the requirements for annual
refresher training in Unit I.D. of the revised MAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Requirements applicable to Non-Accredited Persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to perform work requiring accreditation under TSCA Title II, persons who are not accredited by a State with
an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or by an EPA-approved training provider
as of April 3, 1994, must comply with the upgraded training requirements of this MAP by no later than October 4, 1994.
Non-accredited persons may obtain initial accreditation on a provisional basis by successfully completing any
of the training programs approved under an earlier version of the MAP, and thereby perform work during the first 6 months
after this MAP takes effect. However, by October 4, 1994, these persons must have successfully completed an upgraded
training program that fully complies with the requirements of this MAP in order to continue to perform work requiring
accreditation under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document modifies the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) distribution formula to allow States
with incompatible intrastate regulations limited participation in only the basic grant program beyond October
1, 1994. It does not change the distribution formula pertaining to those States that have achieved compatibility
with respect to both interstate and intrastate transportation. The revised formula is necessary to provide continued
funding for States that have not achieved full compatibility in the enforcement of safety regulations applicable
to intrastate transportation. Such States will be qualified through formula allocation, rather than suffering
absolute loss of eligibility after September 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) was first authorized in the Surface Transportation Assistance
Act of 1982 (sec. 404, Pub. L. 97&hyph;424, 96 Stat. 2097, 2156) and most recently reauthorized by the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (sec. 4002, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2140) which was signed
into law on December 19, 1991. The original authorization contained certain conditions States had to meet to be eligible
for funding. One such condition required each State to adopt and enforce commercial motor vehicle safety regulations
which are compatible with the Federal requirements. Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 350 was amended
by a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 40946), to reflect the mandates of the ISTEA. The amended rule, among other things, defined
compatibility, with respect to interstate applicability, to mean identical with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Regulations (FMCSR) and, with respect to intrastate applicability, to mean within the Tolerance Guidelines. The
rule also required interstate compatibility to be achieved not later than October 1, 1993. The FHWA's Tolerance Guidelines,
which set the compatibility requirements for intrastate regulations, were included in the new regulation as appendix
C to part 350 and future funding under MCSAP was conditioned on achieving intrastate compatibility by October 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With this rulemaking, the FHWA is modifying part 350 to allow partial funding of States notwithstanding intrastate
incompatibility. States that have not achieved full intrastate compatibility will receive 50 percent of their basic
formula allocation. The formula funds which are withheld from those States which do not have compatible intrastate
regulations will be made available to States with compatible comprehensive programs to conduct certain high priority
projects that are innovative, successful, cost-effective and cost-efficient. This change is consistent with the
legislative direction in the ISTEA to develop an improved distribution formula that both promotes innovative programs
and provides incentives to States that increase compatibility, section 4002(k), Public Law 102&hyph;240. It rewards
those States that have fully compatible interstate and intrastate safety regulations, encourages comprehensive
programs, and provides funds for high priority areas. The amendment will also enable the FHWA to maintain a basic commercial
motor vehicle inspection program uniformly and universally applied by the States through the continued availability
of Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA emphasizes that States must continue to meet the requirement for interstate compatibility, and this interim
final rule change will not affect that requirement. The FHWA believes that fully compatible safety and hazardous
materials regulations are an essential element of MCSAP. Through the MCSAP, the FHWA, the States, and the Commercial
Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have developed a coordinated, nationwide program of uniform inspections, enforcement,
and data collection. This avoids duplication of efforts by the States and promotes compliance by the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modification made by this interim final rule continues the progress made through MCSAP by permitting States with
only intrastate variances to continue to participate in the basic program while providing a strong incentive for
them to adopt and enforce compatible intrastate regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Compatible Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major goal of the MCSAP is to achieve nationwide uniform regulations, laws, and practices. The FHWA has determined
that forty-nine States, the District of Columbia, and three territories have adopted compatible rules applicable
to interstate commerce. Thirty-six States and territories have adopted compatible intrastate rules. This is indicative
of the significant progress that the States and the FHWA have made largely through the MCSAP toward reaching the goal
of national uniform commercial motor vehicle safety regulations and enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ideally, State commercial motor vehicle laws would exactly mirror Federal regulations. Indeed, the States are encouraged
to adopt regulations applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce which are identical to the Federal regulations.
Moreover, the FHWA strongly encourages States to implement a system which allows them to automatically adopt any
new Federal regulation, which would preclude any question of future incompatibility and reduce the chance of an interruption
in the States' MCSAP funding. The FHWA recognizes, however, that circumstances may exist which make complete adoption
by the States difficult. The FHWA has therefore provided the States with limited flexibility, through the Tolerance
Guidelines, to address these local issues. In accordance with the ISTEA mandate to issue these guidelines in formal
regulations, they were included in the FMCSRs as appendix C to part 350 (57 FR 174, September 8, 1992). The Tolerance
Guidelines define the extent to which intrastate regulations can differ from the FMCSRs, yet still be considered
to be compatible. Additional differences and industry exemptions are strongly discouraged. In order to gain FHWA's
approval of additional differences, a State must carry a heavy burden of demonstrating that the difference would
have little impact on commercial vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without this modification to part 350, 13 of the States who are currently participating in MCSAP may not qualify for
any MCSAP formula grants in fiscal year (FY) 1995. These States (Alaska, Arizona, California, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine,
Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin) are allocated a combined
total of $16.7 million in Federal funds. These States conducted a combined total of 530,886 of the 1.6 million driver/vehicle
inspections done in FY 1992. If the current part 350 requirements are not changed as provided in this rule, these States
will no longer receive any MCSAP funding, which provides a significant portion of the resources for them to conduct
roadside commercial vehicle and driver inspections, safety and compliance reviews, uniform accident and safety
data collection, drug and alcohol abatement programs and other similar activities which have contributed to the
significant reduction of commercial vehicle accidents on our nation's highways since MCSAP began in FY 1984. Thus,
the FHWA has concluded that total loss of MCSAP funds for these States with some remaining intrastate incompatible
rules and regulations would have an adverse impact on commercial motor vehicle safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This change will allow for distribution of 50 percent of the basic formula allocation to those States which have incompatible
intrastate regulations after September 30, 1994. The FHWA has determined that a 50 percent reduction in an incompatible
State's basic formula is significant enough to serve as an incentive to the State to enact compatible laws. It is believed
that a lesser reduction would not send as strong a message to those States which still have incompatible regulations.
Without this change in Part 350, the States with incompatible regulations would not be eligible to receive any Federal
MCSAP funding for FY 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula funds which are withheld from those States which do not have compatible intrastate regulations will be
made available to States with comprehensive programs to conduct certain high priority projects that are innovative,
successful, cost-efficient and cost-effective. See &sect;4002(k) of the ISTEA. States with incompatible intrastate
regulations may also request these funds for activities aimed at achieving a comprehensive program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comprehensive program is one in which a State has and enforces compatible regulations which pertain to both interstate
and intrastate transportation and has a motor carrier safety program which includes roadside inspections; compliance
reviews; traffic enforcement; hazardous materials training; drug and alcohol enforcement; a fully-implemented
SAFETYNET program, including the National Governors Association accident data collection, and as otherwise defined
by FHWA policy. The FHWA believes that States which integrate these activities into their MCSAP have the most effective,
cost efficient, and successful commercial vehicle safety programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with comprehensive programs which are applying for these redistributed funds should request these funds
for high priority projects. High priority projects are those projects identified by FHWA, in consultation with the
States, as having the highest impact on commercial motor vehicle and driver safety. Generally, the FHWA would not
support the use of these funds for activities that create one-time personnel hiring which could not be funded in following
years. High priority projects will change from year to year to support the growth of the program. Current high priority
projects include advanced brake inspection technologies, roadside data collection and communication devices,
border enforcement to support the North American Free Trade Agreement, local commercial vehicle enforcement, and
drug and alcohol enforcement activities.

to ``inapplicable'' in paragraph 350.11(a). This subsection provides the discretion to allow funding notwithstanding
the incompatibility of State laws and regulations applicable to intrastate commerce.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has waived prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this rule because it believes that such prior
notice and opportunity for public comment, at this time, would be contrary to public interest within the meaning of
section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final MCSAP rule published on September 8, 1992, indicated that States must achieve compatibility with Federal
safety rules within published Tolerance Guidelines by October 1, 1994, the first day of Federal fiscal year 1995.
Based on State submissions for Federal fiscal year 1994, the FHWA now believes that 13 States have not yet achieved
an acceptable level of compliance for intrastate safety rules and, unless changes are made in such State laws, these
States will lose all MCSAP funding on October 1, 1994. Each of these States, however, has achieved full interstate
compliance and substantial intrastate compliance. The FHWA has decided that it should revise the amount of MCSAP
funds subject to reduction due to a lack of intrastate compatibility to ensure that important safety programs may
be continued in the States while providing an incentive to States to achieve further intrastate compatibility with
Federal motor carrier safety rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By promulgating an interim final rule at this time, the FHWA hopes to provide State legislatures sufficient time to
consider amendments to State laws, if necessary. Typically, State legislatures meet during the first three months
of the calendar year. While the FHWA notes that the effect of this interim final rule is to lessen the reduction in MCSAP
funds States will experience unless they revise their intrastate rules, the FHWA also recognizes that this action
will reinforce for the States the consequences of this incompatibility. Concurrent with this action, the FHWA is
writing to the 13 affected States explaining the basis for determining that their intrastate rules do not fall within
the Tolerance Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the FHWA believes that adopting an interim final rule at this time will provide State agencies with adequate
time to adjust their programs to accommodate lower MCSAP funding levels before October 1, 1994. If the FHWA delays
this action to accept public comment before taking the action, the FHWA believes that States will not have adequate
notice before October 1, 1994, to take action to avoid the reduction in MCSAP funds or to plan accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the FHWA finds that it would be contrary to the public interest to provide notice and opportunity
for public comment before issuing this rule. Nevertheless, the FHWA is opening a public docket for this rule and providing
60 days for the receipt of public comment. The FHWA will consider all comments received during this 60 day period in
determining whether any revision is necessary to the rule published today.

The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain significant regulatory action under Executive Order
12866 or a significant regulation under the regulatory polices and procedures of the DOT. It is anticipated that the
economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. There
should be no economic impact on private entities as the action is entirely related to adjusting distribution of funds
to public entities to maintain or enhance enforcement of safety regulations. This rule will allow the 13 States with
identified intrastate incompatibilities to remain in the MCSAP at a 50 percent funding level. The additional funds
made available from these incompatible States will potentially provide increased funding for innovative and high
priority projects for the States with comprehensive programs.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of
this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule relates to the requirements States must meet
to qualify for Federal funding under the MCSAP. This rule does not impose any direct requirement on small entities
that will result in increased economic costs.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
This is a grant program to induce States to adopt compatible safety regulations. The effect of the change adopted today
will be to reduce the impact on States that have made substantial efforts to adopt compatible regulations, but which
do not fully comply. The action increases the individual discretion of States which would otherwise lose access to
Federal funds because of exemptions and other tolerances applicable to wholly intrastate transportation.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) exercises its emergency authority to determine the Pacific pocket mouse
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Prior to 1993, this species
had not been observed in over 20 years. The Pacific pocket mouse was rediscovered on the Dana Point Headlands, Orange
County, California, during July 1993. No more than 39 individuals are known to exist despite relatively intensive,
recent surveys in all of the remaining, undisturbed locales where the species historically occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only known existing Pacific pocket mouse population is imminently threatened by a land development project and
depredation by feral and/or domestic cats. Because of the need to make Federal funding, protection, and other measures
immediately available to protect this species and its habitat, the Service finds that an emergency rule action is
justified. This emergency rule provides Federal protection pursuant to the Act for this species for a period of 240
days. A proposed rule to list the Pacific pocket mouse as endangered is published concurrently with this emergency
rule in this same

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is 1 of 19 recognized subspecies of the little pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Hall 1981), a species that is widely distributed throughout arid regions of the western United States and northwestern
Mexico. It is the smallest member of the family Heteromyidae, which consists of spiny pocket mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Heteromys and Liomys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), pocket mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus and Chaetodipus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), kangaroo rats (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dipodomys
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and kangaroo mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microdipodops
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Virtually all members of this family are nocturnal, granivorous, and have external, deep, fur-lined cheek pouches
(Ingles 1965; P. Brylski, consulting mammalogist, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The little pocket mouse is about 110 to 148 millimeters (mm) (4.3 to 6 inches (in)) long from nose to tip of tail. Its body
pelage is spineless, bristle-free, and predominately brown, pinkish buff, or ochraceous buff above and light brown,
pale tawny, buff, or whitish below. Two small patches of lighter hairs typically exist at the base of the ear. The tail
can be either distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. The soles of the hind feet are hairy (Hall 1981). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest subspecies of the little pocket mouse, ranging from about 110 to 126 mm (4.3
to 4.9 in) long from nose to tip of tail. The tail, hind foot, and skull lengths and the size of skull structures are also
the smallest of all little pocket mouse subspecies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Los Angeles pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris brevinasus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which occurs mostly northeast of and more interior than the Pacific pocket mouse, is the only other subspecies of
little pocket mouse in cismontane southern California, is 125 to 145 mm (4.9 to 5.7 in) in total length, and has a longer
tail, hind foot, and skull than the Pacific pocket mouse. The nasal bones in the skull of the Los Angeles pocket mouse
are also considerably larger than those of the Pacific pocket mouse (Huey 1939). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse was originally described by Mearns (1898) as a distinct species, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus pacificus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
based on the type specimen from San Diego County, California. von Bloeker (1931a,b) later recognized the Pacific
pocket mouse as a distinct species, but subsequently concluded that the morphology of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. pacificus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was not sufficiently distinct from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to maintain the Pacific pocket mouse as a distinct species. von Bloeker reduced 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. pacificus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris pacificus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
von Bloeker also described a second coastal subspecies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris cantwelli, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
from El Segundo in Los Angeles County, California (von Bloeker 1932). After an analysis of 331 specimens of the little
pocket mouse, Huey (1939) recognized 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. l. pacificus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to include the two subspecies described by von Bloeker (1932). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a taxonomic review of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. longimembris 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
may be appropriate, Williams (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993) indicated that ``the Pacific pocket mouse is distinct.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse occurs within about 3 kilometers (km) (2 miles (mi)) of the immediate coast of southern California
from Marina del Rey and El Segundo in Los Angeles County south to the vicinity of the Mexican border in San Diego County
(Hall 1981, Williams 1986, Erickson 1993) and below 180 meters (m) (600 feet (ft)) in elevation (Erickson 1993). Although
the range map in Hall (1981) suggests that the range of the Pacific pocket mouse may extend into northwestern Baja California,
Mexico, this subspecies has never been recorded outside of California (Erickson 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse occurs on fine-grain, sandy substrates in the immediate vicinity of the Pacific Ocean (Mearns
1898, von Bloeker 1931a, Grinnell 1933, Bailey 1939). The Pacific pocket mouse inhabits coastal strand, coastal
dunes, river alluvium, and coastal sage scrub growing on marine terraces (Grinnell 1933, Meserve 1972, Erickson
1993). Brylski (1993) detected the only known extant population on the Dana Point Headlands on loose sand substrates
in a coastal sage scrub community dominated by California buckwheat (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eriogonum fasiculatum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and California sage (

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific pocket mouse is likely facultatively or partially fossorial, relatively sedentary, and able to become
torpid, estivate, or hibernate in response to adverse environmental conditions (Ingles 1965, Vaughan 1978, Zeiner

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While active above ground, little pocket mice have ranged up to 320 m (1,000 ft) from their burrows in a 24-hour period
(Burt and Grossenheider 1976). Little pocket mouse home ranges vary in size from 0.12 to 0.56 hectares (0.30 to 1.4
acres), and populations range in density from 1 to 5.5 individuals per hectare (0.4 to 2.2 individuals per acre) (Chew
and Butterworth 1964). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific pocket mice primarily eat the seeds of grasses and forbs, but occasionally eat leafy material and soil-dwelling
insects (von Bloeker 1931a; Meserve 1976a; Jameson and Peeters 1988; P. Brylski, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The little pocket mouse has a high metabolic rate (Bartholomew and Cade 1957), continually needs food supplies while
active, and loses heat rapidly. It has limited capacity to store food. Little pocket mice may stay in their burrows
continuously for up to 5 months in winter, alternating between periods of dormancy and feeding on stored seeds or hibernation
in winter under adverse conditions (Bartholomew and Cade 1957, Ingles 1965, Kenagy 1973, Whitaker 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little pocket mice live up to 7.5 years in captivity and 3 to 5 years in the wild (Burt and Grossenheider 1976, Whitaker
1980). Pregnant and lactating females have been found from April through June, and immatures have been reported from
June through September (Erickson 1993). Burt and Grossenheider (1976) previously reported that the little pocket
mouse produces one or two litters (ranging in size from three to seven young) in a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific pocket mouse is historically known from eight populations. Approximately 80 percent of all Pacific pocket
mouse records are from 1931 or 1932 (Erickson 1993). The following summarizes the historical distribution of the
Pacific pocket mouse by county: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Los Angeles County.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific pocket mouse historically was detected in three areas: Marina del Rey/El Segundo, Wilmington, and Clifton.
No records of the Pacific pocket mouse exist in Los Angeles County since 1938 (P. Brylski, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Orange County.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific pocket mouse has been found at two locales in Orange County: Dana Point and the San Joaquin Hills. The species
was found on ``Spyglass Hill'' in the San Joaquin Hills from 1968 to 1971 (Erickson 1993). G.G. Cantwell previously
collected 10 specimens at the Dana Point Headlands in 1932.

San Diego County.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pacific pocket mouse has been detected at three general locales in San Diego County: the San Onofre area, Santa
Margarita River Estuary, and the lower Tijuana River Valley. Another report of a single Pacific pocket mouse in suitable
habitat from Lux Canyon, Encinitas, in June 1989 is now considered probable by the observer (Erickson 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only known extant population of the Pacific pocket mouse was rediscovered in July 1993 on the Dana Point Headlands
in Orange County, California. Between 25 to 39 individual Pacific pocket mice were detected during trapping surveys
conducted into August 1993 (Brylski 1993). This was the first time the Pacific pocket mouse had been collected at this
site since 1971 (Erickson 1993). Numerous small-mammal survey and trapping efforts within its historical range
(D. Erickson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993; Erickson 1993) have failed to locate any additional populations. The remaining site is imminently threatened
by a development that is expected to receive final approval in the very near future.

Previous Federal Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pacific pocket mouse was designated by the Service as a category 2 candidate species for Federal listing as endangered
or threatened in 1985 (50 FR 37966). It was retained in this category in subsequent notices of review published by the
Service in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 1989 and 1991 (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively). Category 2 comprises taxa for which information now in the
possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate,
but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not currently available to support proposed
rules. The Service made the determination to list this species on the basis of new information received in 1993 that
resulted in the elevation of the Pacific pocket mouse to category 1 status. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the
Service has on file sufficient information to support proposals for endangered or threatened status.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Pacific
pocket mouse should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Act and regulations
(50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined
to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These
factors and their application to the Pacific pocket mouse (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Perognathus longimembris pacificus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although originally known from eight locales, the Pacific pocket mouse now occurs in one site on the Dana Point Headlands
of Dana Point in Orange County. Although the Dana Point Headlands have remained relatively unchanged since the Pacific
pocket mouse was first detected at this locale, a land development project has been approved by the Planning Commission,
with final approval anticipated in early 1994. This proposed residential and hotel complex project would result
in the removal of 3.65 acres of the 3.75 acres of habitat that Brylski (1993) identified as being occupied by Pacific
pocket mice (EDAW 1993b). Grading that would destroy the only known Pacific pocket mouse population may proceed upon
final approval of the proposed project. This site is also threatened by fuel modification for fire protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Los Angeles County, two of the three historic locales for the Pacific pocket mouse (Clifton and Wilmington) have
been developed, and the third (Marina del Rey/El Segundo) has been substantially altered since the species was last
detected there. Recent surveys have been unsuccessful in relocating the species in the vicinity of Marina del Rey
or El Segundo. The Hyperion area, which formerly contained relatively large expanses of coastal strand and wetland
habitats, has been extensively developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Orange County, the development of the Spyglass Hill area began in 1972. This development resulted in the destruction
of the formerly occupied habitat at that site.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although portions of the San Onofre area and the Santa Margarita River mouth in San Diego County remain relatively
undisturbed, recent survey and small mammal trapping efforts at these locations failed to detect the presence of
the Pacific pocket mouse (P. Brylski, pers. comm., 1993; R. Erickson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993; Erickson 1993; R. Zembal, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). During the 1930s, Camp Pendleton
Marine Corps Base did not exist and the city of Oceanside was immediately adjacent to the Santa Margarita River estuary.
Much of the southern half of the Santa Margarita River estuary was destroyed in the early 1940s during the establishment
of Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and the related construction of a boat basin and harbor facilities. In addition,
the Oceanside area has been extensively developed since the Pacific pocket mouse was last recorded there in 1931,
and little, if any, suitable habitat remains at that location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the lower Tijuana River Valley evidently supported a relatively large population of the Pacific pocket
mouse in the early 1930s, this area has been substantially altered and currently provides little, if any, suitable
habitat. Recent trapping efforts have failed to detect the Pacific pocket mouse at this location (Taylor and Tiszler
1991; R.T. Miller, pers. comm. to Erickson, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potential site for the Pacific pocket mouse is Lux Canyon in Encinitas, San Diego County, where an unverified
sighting occurred in 1989. However, the majority of Lux Canyon has already been converted to urban development and
agriculture. The remaining habitat in Lux Canyon is highly fragmented and subject to additional urban development
(F. Roberts, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opportunities to find additional populations of the Pacific pocket mouse are limited. Less than 400 hectares (1,000
acres) of about 28,000 hectares (70,000 acres) (1 percent) encompassing the range of the Pacific pocket mouse in Los
Angeles County are undeveloped (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data, 1993). About 17,600 hectares
(44,000 acres) of approximately 21,600 hectares (54,000 acres) (81 percent) encompassing the range of the Pacific
pocket mouse in Orange County has been converted to urban uses (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data,
1993). Land use patterns in coastal San Diego County are similar. Oberbauer and Vanderwier (1991) reported that 72
percent of coastal sage scrub, 94 percent of native grasslands, 88 percent of coastal mixed chaparral, 88 percent
of coastal salt marsh, 100 percent of coastal strand, and 92 percent of maritime sage scrub habitats in San Diego County
had been converted to urban and agricultural uses by 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional 16 hectares (41 acres) of suitable habitat for the Pacific pocket mouse occurs on the Dana Point Headlands.
However, 13 hectares (32 acres) of this habitat would be eliminated by the same project that threatens the only known
occupied habitat (EDAW 1993b). Additional potential habitat occurs on Pelican Hill in the San Joaquin Hills and along
the coastal bluffs in Crystal Cove State Park. Over 50 percent of the Pelican Hill site was graded in March 1993 with
the remainder approved for development (F. Roberts, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the remaining undeveloped range of the Pacific pocket mouse, areas that contain suitable habitat for the species
represent less than 10 percent of the remaining habitat. This is exemplified by the situation in Orange County, where
identified suitable habitat for the Pacific pocket mouse is restricted to less than 60 hectares (150 acres) (F. Roberts,
pers. comm., 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). Erickson (1993) has speculated that the red fox ``may have hastened the demise of the Pacific pocket mouse in
the El Segundo area,'' where the species apparently was well-represented historically.

Feral and domestic cats are known to be predators of native rodents (Hubbs 1951, George 1974). Pearson (1964) concluded
that the removal of 4,200 mice from a 14 hectare (35 acre) test plot was accomplished largely by 6 cats over an 8-month
period. Feral and/or domestic cats are threatening the only known population of the Pacific pocket mouse. A resident
living immediately adjacent to the only known population has reported that domestic cats had recently and repeatedly
brought home a number of ``tiny gray mice'' (P. Brylski,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Existing regulatory mechanisms that may provide some protection for the Pacific pocket mouse include: (1) The Federal

(2) the California Natural Community Conservation Planning Program; (3) the California Environmental Quality
Act; (4) land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies or by private groups and organizations;
and (5) local laws and regulations.

The Pacific pocket mouse is currently classified as a candidate for Federal listing under the Act and as a Species of
Special Concern ``Of Highest Priority'' by the California Department of Fish and Game (Department). However, Federal
candidate species and Department Species of Special Concern have no local status and are afforded no protection under
the Federal or California Endangered Species Acts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only known population of the Pacific pocket mouse is found in conjunction with a population of coastal California
gnatcatchers on the Dana Point Headlands (Brylski 1993; EDAW 1993a,b). The coastal California gnatcatcher's status
as a threatened species gives it protection under the Act. However, the legal authority to protect the gnatcatcher
does not extend to candidate species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under provisions under section 10(a) of the Act, the Service may permit the incidental ``take'' of the gnatcatcher
during the course of an otherwise legal activity as long as the likelihood of that species' survival and recovery in
the wild is not precluded. If the Service authorized take of the gnatcatcher at the Dana Point Headlands pursuant to
section 10(a), the permitted activities could result in the extinction of the Pacific pocket mouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the State of California established the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Program to address the
conservation needs of natural ecosystems throughout the State. The initial focus of that program is the coastal sage
scrub community occupied, in part, by the Pacific pocket mouse. At the present time, no plans have been completed or
implemented, and no protection is currently proposed to prevent or reduce impacts to 3.65 of the 3.75 acres of occupied
habitat on the Dana Point Headlands that are proposed for development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many cases, land-use planning decisions are made on the basis of environmental review documents prepared in accordance
with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or the National Environmental Policy Act. These Acts have not
adequately protected Pacific pocket mouse habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A relocation program proposed to mitigate impacts to the Pacific pocket mouse on the Dana Point Headlands (EDAW 1993b)
has not been fully defined or developed and must be considered highly experimental. As part of this proposed mitigation
program, ``the Pacific pocket mouse will be relocated to suitable on-site or off-site locations that are or will be
preserved as suitable habitat'' (EDAW 1993b). EDAW (1993b) has concluded that the ``implementation of this mitigation
will not reduce impacts to this species to a level of insignificance.'' The program proposed in the Dana Point Headlands
to control domestic cat predation is also inadequate.

Other natural or man-made factors affecting its continued existence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This species is highly susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic environmental or demographic causes because
the remaining animals are found in one location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined that listing as endangered is appropriate because the remaining location is imminently
threatened by urban development.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasons for Emergency Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4(b)(7) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and 50 CFR 424.20, the Secretary may determine a species to be endangered or threatened by an emergency rule that shall
cease 240 days following publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reasons why this rule is necessary are discussed below. If at any time after this rule has been published the Secretary
determines that substantial evidence does not exist to warrant such a rule, it shall be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the eight known sites historically occupied by the species, all but two have been developed or significantly altered
through human activities. Suitable habitat remains in the Marina del Rey/El Segundo portion of Los Angeles County;
however, efforts to find the animal in this area have not been successful. One other site at San Onofre in San Diego County
still retains suitable habitat. However, the Pacific pocket mouse was never common at this site, and recent surveys
have not located any individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only remaining population (containing no more than 39 animals) of the Pacific pocket mouse occurs on the Dana Point
Headlands of Dana Point, California. As discussed under factors A, C, and D in the Summary of Factors Affecting the
Species section above, an emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being and continued survival of the Pacific
pocket mouse exists as the result of the imminent, proposed destruction of 3.65 of the 3.75 acres of occupied habitat
(Brylski 1993; EDAW 1993a,b). The Pacific pocket mouse is also imminently threatened at this location by feral and/or
domestic cat depredation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Service finds that the Pacific pocket mouse is in imminent danger of extinction throughout
all or a significant portion of its range and warrants immediate protection under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat, as defined by section 3(5)(A) of the Act, means: (i) The specific areas within the geographical
area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species, and (II) that may require special management considerations
or protection, and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed,
upon a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that critical habitat be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable
concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR
424.12(a)(1)) state that a designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations
exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can
be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical habitat would
not be beneficial to the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the Pacific pocket mouse. The
only known population of this species is found on private lands where Federal jurisdiction or involvement in land-use
activities is not expected. Therefore, the designation of critical habitat within the existing range of the Pacific
pocket mouse would not appreciably benefit the species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition, cooperation with the States, and requires
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities are discussed, in part, below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The Service does not expect
to receive requests for consultation from other Federal agencies with respect to this species because no Federal
involvement is expected for activities occurring within habitat currently occupied by the Pacific pocket mouse.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or
attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess,
sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations on listed wildlife and inquiries regarding same should be addressed to the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181
