SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its emergency loan (EM) regulations to revise the applicant
eligibility calculation and appraisal requirements and to require crop insurance. This action is necessary to ease
the EM eligibility requirements, to expedite EM application processing time, and to reduce losses to family-size
farmers and the Government. The intended effect is to provide assistance to a greater number of farmers affected by
major disasters in a timely manner.

Discussion of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. FmHA is publishing
this proposed rule with a 15-day comment period. This proposed rule relieves the restriction of considering disaster
related assistance or compensation in the EM eligibility calculation. Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that
the need to provide immediate assistance to farmers who have suffered severe production and physical losses as a result
of natural disasters also justifies the shortened comment period under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major agricultural disasters during the 1993 crop year, including extensive flooding and rainfall in 9 Midwestern
States and drought in 3 Southeastern States, will result in a significant increase in demand for FmHA direct loan assistance.
In the 9 flood states alone, over 8 million acres of crops were lost or not planted in 1993. Estimates indicate that the
1993 floods were the second costliest weather disaster in the history of the United States. Preliminary estimates
are that as many as 10,000 of the affected farmers may require financial assistance from FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for a change in the regulations is immediate. Farmers have concluded 1993 operations, and are consulting
with their lenders to plan for 1994. Farmers who have suffered severe production losses are in dire need of disaster
program assistance to repay creditors and suppliers annual production loans, open supplier accounts, and installments
due on intermediate and long term debts and to otherwise repair and continue their farming and ranching operations.
FmHA is receiving loan requests at an increasing rate. The Agency wants to give the public an opportunity for input
on the proposed change but FmHA needs regulations in place for spring planting, so a reasonable compromise was the
15-day comment period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because of the scope of the situation and the impact on local, regional, and national economies, the Agency believes
that an amendment to the regulations after a shortened comment period is the only way to assure that affected farmers
receive the assistance they need on a timely basis to recover from these disasters. Any further delay in the timing
of this amendment will reduce the Agency's ability to meet the needs of those affected, thus imposing additional hardships
on those who have already suffered substantially from flood or drought, and jeopardizing individual and community
financial recovery from these disasters. The proposal to require crop insurance on the coming year's crop as a condition
of making EM loans is necessary to protect the borrower and the Government. The requirement and its exceptions, however,
will not delay the making or reduce the number of EM loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The making, supervision, and servicing of farm loans to FmHA borrowers is governed primarily by the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT) (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.). In particular, 7 U.S.C. 1970 provides that the Secretary,
and through delegation FmHA, shall extend emergency loans ``to any applicant seeking assistance based on production
losses if the applicant shows that a single enterprise which constitutes a basic part of the applicant's farming,
ranching, or aquaculture operation has sustained at least a 30 per centum loss of normal per acre or per animal production,''
or a lesser per centum as determined by FmHA, as a result of the disaster and other eligibility criteria are met. Under
the statute, FmHA also must make production loss loans based on 80 per centum, or such greater per centum as determined
by FmHA, of the total actual production loss sustained by the eligible applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing emergency (EM) loan regulations state that all financial disaster assistance/compensation will be
considered in determining the applicant's eligibility for EM assistance and again in calculating the maximum amount
of loss loan entitlement. Once eligibility is established, then all single enterprises showing a production loss
are considered in the calculation to determine the maximum loss loan entitlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has concluded that modifications to the current provisions are in order. In the 13 years (since 2/13/80)
that FmHA has employed the present calculation for determining eligibility, there have been numerous instances
where producers would have suffered qualifying losses yet were deemed ineligible for an emergency loss loan only
because the dollar loss was reduced by the amount of disaster related assistance/compensation so that the 30 percent
loss level was not reached. Based on this experience, it is the Agency's opinion that the ability of FmHA to carry out
the underlying intent of the program_to provide loans to farmers who have suffered losses due to natural disasters
and who cannot obtain credit from private sources_has been seriously hindered. For this reason, the Agency has concluded
that it can best serve these farmers, and thereby meet the goals of the program, by revising its regulations as follows.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.163, by revising the applicant eligibility calculation
to consider only the dollar loss of a single enterprise based on the difference in income between the disaster year
and the normal year. Disaster related assistance/compensation would not be considered in the eligibility calculation.
The maximum loss loan entitlement, however, still would be the sum of production losses to all enterprises less any
disaster related assistance/compensation and costs not incurred. This change is necessary to respond to the extreme
financial stress of many farmers affected by repetitive natural disasters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By changing the EM loan eligibility calculation, more applicants will be permitted to qualify for loan assistance.
This revision to the regulation complies with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act,
42 U.S.C. 5155, prohibiting the duplication of Federal disaster benefits. The amount of the individual EM loss loan
entitlement will continue to be reduced by the amount of any disaster related assistance or compensation received
or to be received by the applicant. The Agency considered limited legislative history related to EM loan legislation
(Pub. L. 94&hyph;68, August 5, 1975) which suggested that a person who had Federal crop insurance which covered a portion
of the disaster loss might become ineligible by not meeting the 20 percent damage test (now 30 percent). The legislative
history, however, was found unpersuasive and insufficient to require the Agency to continue its practice of considering
other disaster benefits at the point of EM eligibility when not specifically required by statute. The Agency proposes
these changes with the belief that more farmers in need will be assisted and a prudent loan making program will be preserved
within statutory constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also proposes to amend &sect;1945.169 by requiring applicants to purchase multi-peril crop insurance
when receiving EM loan assistance. CONACT section 321(b) states that an applicant shall be ineligible for EM loan
assistance for crop losses to an annual crop planted or harvested after December 31, 1986, if crop insurance was available
to the applicant under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. However, the Disaster Assistance Acts of 1988 and 1989; the
Food Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act (FACT Act) of 1990; the Dire Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1991;
and the Supplemental Appropriations, Transfers and Recessions Act of 1992 waived this crop insurance requirement
for losses to annual crops planted for harvest in years 1988&hyph;1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
While these statutes waived the eligibility requirement, the Disaster Assistance Acts of 1988 and 1989 and the 1990
FACT Act required eligible EM applicants to agree to purchase crop insurance as a loan condition, subject to certain
exceptions. (The loan would be made on the condition that the borrower obtain crop insurance in the future, if not already
insured.) The Dire Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1991 and the Supplemental Appropriations, Transfers and
Recessions Act of 1992 did not have this requirement. However, upon implementing changes required by the 1991 Act,
the Agency administratively required eligible applicants to obtain crop insurance on their 1992 crop in order to
receive an EM loan. This administrative language was inadvertently omitted when making regulation changes required
by the 1992 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes it is prudent for applicants to purchase crop insurance on the coming year's crop and proposes
to once again require it as an EM loan condition. Currently, FmHA only encourages EM borrowers to obtain FCIC crop insurance
or multi-peril crop insurance, if available. Most FmHA applicants have limited resources and are unable to fully
recover from major disasters. Purchasing crop insurance will reduce the applicant's risk of incurring devastating
losses, and will also protect the Government's interest. The Agency, however, has provided for two exceptions. If
crop insurance is not available, the Agency will not require it. In addition, if the premium cost of the insurance would
prevent the applicant from showing ability to repay the loan, the Agency will waive the requirement. The Agency wants
to provide assistance to such applicants if they can otherwise project repayment ability. Thus, the crop insurance
requirement will not delay the making of needed EM loans or limit the number of loans made since crop insurance is only
a loan condition which will be waived in the two instances noted above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also proposes to amend &sect;1945.175 by revising the requirement for two complete appraisals when the
first appraisal reflects adequate security for the loan(s). Section 324 (d) of the CONACT states that farm security,
including land, livestock, and equipment, for EM loans will be valued based on the higher of the value of the assets
on the day before the Governor requests assistance and the value of the assets one year before such day. While the two
values must be considered, the values need not be based on two complete appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change indicates that when a real estate appraisal to establish the value on the day before the Governor's
EM designation request reflects adequate security for the loan, the basis for the second value for one year and one
day before the subject request will be documented in an attachment to the appraisal. When the first appraisal does
not reflect adequate security only the applicable parts of a second Form FmHA 1922&hyph;1, ``Appraisal Report - Farm
Tract,'' reflecting the changes between the two dates, will be completed to establish the value one year and one day
before the Governor's request. In cases where there is a physical loss of real estate and funds will be used for development,
the recommended market value will be as improved. This is consistent with general appraisal practices and current
Form FmHA 1922&hyph;1 which includes a provision for the contributory value of buildings as improved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to chattel appraisals, when the value one year and one day before the Governor's request reflects adequate
security, the value one day before the Governor's request will be established on Form FmHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1945&hyph;15, ``Value Determination Worksheet,'' by a reasonable estimate. This change will reduce Agency processing
time and cost in relation to Emergency loans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All recipients of EM loans must agree, as a condition of the loan, to obtain multi-peril crop insurance under the Federal
Crop Insurance Act for the coming year's crop. When one of the conditions of paragraph (j)(1) of this section exists,
the approval official will document in the applicant's file the basis for not requiring crop insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Applicants will not be required to obtain crop insurance when any one of the following conditions exists: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Crop insurance is not available for the crop, i.e., there is no open season and no opportunity to acquire crop insurance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The financial projections on which the loan approval is based indicate that the premium cost of the required insurance
would prevent the applicant from projecting a feasible plan, and thus disqualifying the applicant for loan assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When crops are the primary source of repayment for EM loans, FmHA will require an ``Assignment of Indemnity'' on
the borrower's crop insurance policy(ies). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When EM loans are based on physical losses only, crop insurance will only be required when loan funds will be used
for annual production expenses. In such cases, the same conditions will apply as stated in paragraph (j)(1) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the payment of crop insurance premiums is not required until after harvest, the premiums may be paid by releasing
insured crop(s) sale proceeds, notwithstanding the limits of &sect;&sect;1962.17 and 1962.29(b) of subpart A of
part 1962 of this chapter. If the borrower's crop losses are sufficient to warrant an indemnity payment, the premium
due will be deducted by the insurance carrier from such payment. The FmHA County Office will maintain a record on Form
FmHA 1905&hyph;12, ``Monthly Expirations,'' of the dates which each borrower's crop insurance premium(s) is due.
This is in accordance with FmHA Instruction 1905&hyph;A, a copy of which is available in any FmHA office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When an applicant purchases the necessary crop insurance as a condition to receiving an EM loan and, after the EM
loan is closed, allows the policy(ies) to lapse or be cancelled before completion of the production year, the borrower
will become immediately liable for full repayment of all principal and interest outstanding on any EM loan made on
the condition of obtaining crop insurance. The loan approval official will insert this requirement in item 41 of Form
FmHA 1940&hyph;1, ``Request for Obligation of Funds,'' which is signed by the applicant and the FmHA loan approval
official.

(2) Real estate appraisals will be completed as provided in subpart E of part 1922 of this chapter. However, the value
of assets that secure EM loans associated with a disaster having any portion of its incidence period occurring on or
after May 31, 1983, must be based on the higher of two values, all of which must be part of the file. These values will show:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The asset value on the day before a State Governor's, Indian Tribal Council's, or an FmHA State Director's first
EM designation request, which is associated with the naming of one or more counties in a State as a disaster area where
eligible farmers may qualify for EM loans; or the asset value one year (365 days) and one day before the designation
request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Form FmHA 1922&hyph;1, will be completed to reflect the recommended market value (RMV) as of the day before the
Governor's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When the value one day before the Governor's request reflects adequate security for the loan(s), the basis for
arriving at the second value, one year and one day before the Governor's request, will be documented in an attachment
to the appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When the first appraisal does not reflect adequate security only the applicable Part(s) 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of a second
Form FmHA 1922&hyph;1, will be completed to reflect changes between the two dates, and establish a value one year and
one day before the Governor's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In cases where there is a physical loss of real estate and funds will be used for development, the RMV will be as improved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The following types of real estate offered as collateral for securing EM loans will be appraised at the present
market value only: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Farm real estate the applicant/borrower did not own on the date set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Real estate ``not owned'' by the applicant/borrower (for example, a relative if offering real estate as collateral
for the proposed EM loan). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A single family dwelling located on a nonfarm tract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Other types of real estate such as apartment houses and commercial buildings. The County Supervisor will request
the assistance of the State Director in establishing the value of such real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Sales data utilized in the preparation of the necessary appraisal(s) should conform to the dates set forth in
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, to ensure a fair market value of the property is established. In addition, it
should be confirmed that said sales resulted from reasonable sales efforts and that both the buyer and seller were
willing, informed, and knowledgeable parties.

(4) Chattel appraisals will be completed on Form FmHA 1945&hyph;15, ``Value Determination Worksheet,'' (EM loans
only) when chattels are taken as security. The property which will serve as security will be described in sufficient
detail so it can be identified. Sources such as livestock market reports and publications reflecting values of farm
machinery and equipment will be used as appropriate. The value of assets that secure EM loans associated with a disaster
having any portion of the incidence period occurring on or after May 31, 1983, must be based on the higher of two values,
all of which must be made part of the file. These values will be based on the time periods contained in paragraph (c)(2)(i)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In those cases where the value one year and one day before the Governor's request reflects adequate security, the
appraiser or County Supervisor will reasonably estimate the value one day before the Governor's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Chattels owned by the applicant, and nonfarm chattel property offered as security (such as planes, house trailers,
boats, etc.) will be appraised at the present market value only. Chattels that the applicant/borrower did not own
on the dates set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section will be appraised at the present market value only.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace near Morris, IL, to accommodate an amended Very High Frequency
Omnidirectional Range Station-Airport (VOR&hyph;A) instrument approach procedure to Morris Municipal-James
R. Washburn Field Airport, Morris, IL. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level
(AGL) is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect of this proposal is to provide segregation
of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual
weather conditions. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating
in the area.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace near Morris, IL, to accommodate an amended VOR&hyph;A instrument approach procedure to Morris Municipal-James
R. Washburn Field Airport, Morris, IL. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain
aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument
approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area
would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for
which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not
a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation
as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures
and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 5, 1993, the FAA issued Notice No. 93&hyph;14, entitled ``Aging Airplane Safety'' that proposed changes
that would require persons operating older airplanes to certify that certain airplane maintenance actions had been
performed; would allow the Administrator to establish an airplane operational limit beyond which additional maintenance
actions must be accomplished, would implement part of the FAA's Aging Airplane Program Plan; and would respond to
the Aging Aircraft Safety Act of 1991. The proposed rules are intended to assure that older airplanes are properly
maintained for continued use in air transportation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a request dated January 21, 1994, RAA asked that the comment period be extended 30 days. Because of heavy commitments
to recent Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) activities, and many questions from its member airlines
on the proposals, RAA had not completed analyzing the potential effects of the proposed rulemaking and could not provide
substantive comments prior to the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that an extension of the comment period will allow RAA and its members additional time for a more
thorough review of applicable issues and questions raised by the NPRM, and the drafting of responsive comments. The
FAA recognizes, in addition, that the intervening holiday period may have impeded the ability of interested persons
to formulate comprehensive responses to the issues in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order, therefore, to give all interested persons additional time to complete their comments, the FAA finds that
it is in the public interest to extend the comment period. Accordingly, the comments period will close on March 4, 1994.

 On January 11, 1991, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted amendments of its source
monitoring rules and sulfur dioxide (SO2) rules to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as
State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. Because of unsupported emission limit relaxations and enforceability
deficiencies in the amended State regulations, USEPA is proposing to disapprove this SIP revision request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Summary of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 11, 1991, IDEM submitted its amended source monitoring rules and sulfur dioxide (SO2) rules to USEPA as
Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. The submittal amends 326 Indiana Administrative Code (IAC)
Articles 3 and 7. Because the rules contain enforceability deficiencies and unsupported emission limit relaxations,
USEPA proposes to disapprove the January 11, 1991 submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Analysis of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Indiana's revised monitoring rule consists of 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, 3&hyph;2.1, and 3&hyph;3. The revised sulfur
dioxide rule consists of 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1, 7&hyph;2, 7&hyph;3, and 7&hyph;4. The following paragraphs describe
the individual rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 requires continuous emission monitoring for sources in several categories, including large
fossil fuel-fired steam generators, sulfuric acid producers, and catalytic cracking units. Fossil fuel-fired
steam generators of greater than 100 million British Thermal Units per hour (MMBTU/hr) heat input capacity are required
under this rule to continuously monitor their emissions for opacity, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and oxygen
or carbon monoxide content. The rule allows IDEM's Commissioner to require additional sources to use continuous
monitoring equipment. This rule contains the minimum emission monitoring requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 51,
appendix P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 requires facilities to report excess emissions quarterly, and allows 3-hour block averaging
of gaseous measurements. This averaging time is consistent with the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Facility owners must keep all monitoring records on file for 2 years.
These requirements are consistent with 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. The rule requires facility owners to submit to IDEM
written standard operating procedures describing calibration and quality control procedures for the operation
of all required continuous emission monitors. The rule also sets forth conversion factors to be used with monitoring
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 refers to 40 CFR [part] 60, appendix B for the performance specifications of the required monitoring
equipment, and specifies that where reference is made to the ``Administrator'' in 40 CFR [part] 60, appendix B, the
term ``Commissioner'' is to be inserted for the purposes of this rule. Such substitution is allowed by USEPA, according
to 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 3.1. The USEPA has set forth explicit criteria for the Commissioner's modification
of the rule's requirements in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. However, ``Commissioner's discretion'' language that USEPA
finds unacceptable for the reasons described in section III below appears in other portions of 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1,
e.g., 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1&hyph;1 (waivers) and 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1&hyph;2 (alternate instrument response settings),
and renders these rules unapprovable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
326 IAC 3&hyph;2.1 provides reporting requirements and specifies the facility operating conditions under which
emission testing should be performed. The rule also prescribes specific testing procedures for particulate matter,
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. It specifies that sources should use emission
test methodologies set forth in 40 CFR [part] 61, appendix A, and 40 CFR [part] 61, appendix B. This is incorrect. The
rule should cite 40 CFR Part 60, appendix A, rather than 40 CFR [part] 61, appendix A. In addition, the rule allows the
State to authorize alternate emission test methods, changes in test procedure, or alternate operating load levels
during tests. Such ``Commissioner's discretion'' is not acceptable to USEPA, for the reasons described below in
section III.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
326 IAC 3&hyph;3 prescribes sampling and analysis procedures for coal and fuel oil. Sources with total coal-fired
capacity of 1500 or more MMBTU/hr actual heat input must collect composite samples daily, in accordance with specified
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedures. Sources with total coal-fired capacity between 100
and 1500 MMBTU/hr actual heat input must draw coal samples at least 3 times per day and at least once per 8-hour period,
but may composite and analyze these samples monthly. It is not acceptable for facilities of this size to perform only
monthly coal analysis to determine compliance. Monthly analysis will not ensure that the short-term SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS will be protected. 326 IAC 3&hyph;3 does not specify coal sampling analysis procedures to be used by facilities
with total coal-fired heat input capacity less than 100 MMBTU/hr. These small facilities are required by 326 IAC 7&hyph;2
to report coal analysis data, as collected pursuant to 326 IAC 3&hyph;3, but it is not clear whether each facility must
use the coal sampling and analysis methods prescribed for the larger facilities or is expected to provide its own alternative
method. This rule also allows ``Commissioner's discretion'' in prescribing and in performing alternate fuel sampling
and analysis procedures. The USEPA believes that such discretion is unacceptable for the reasons described below
in section III of this document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1 continues to state that facilities combusting coal may not emit more than 6.0 lb/MMBTU. Facilities
which use both coal and oil simultaneously as fuel must adhere to the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limit for coal alone. Facilities which use both oil and any fuel other than coal simultaneously must not exceed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limits by combining their usual fuel with lower-sulfur fuels. However, this rule fails to couple the lb/MMBTU
emission limits with any applicable averaging time. The rule should require compliance with the emission limits

326 IAC 7&hyph;2 specifies that compliance or noncompliance with emission limits can be determined by a stack test
in accordance with the test methods in 40 CFR [part] 60, appendix A. Continuous emission monitoring data collected
pursuant to 326 IAC 3&hyph;1 may be used to determine compliance with emission limits. 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 also requires
facilities to report the results of fuel sampling and analysis. Fuel combustion sources with total coal-fired heat
input capacity of 1500 MMBTU/hr or greater are to keep records of average daily coal sulfur content and SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission rate (in units of lb/MMBTU). Sources with total coal-fired heat input capacity between 100 and 1500 MMBTU/hr
need only record and report average monthly coal sulfur content and SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

less than 100 MMBTU/hr may submit either calendar month or annual average coal sulfur content and SO

the calculation and reporting of an annual average alone is not acceptable. This would not be an acceptable determination
of continuous compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission rates for fuel combustion sources should be calculated based on emission factors published in AP&hyph;42,
``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors.'' If compliance is to be determined through fuel sampling and analysis,
USEPA prefers that SO

 emission factors based on sulfur dioxide measurements, but the rule does not specify the rigorous scientific support
required, or that the alternate emission factors will be included in site-specific SIP revisions. Therefore, this
rule cannot be approved. For compliance determinations, USEPA cannot allow the Commissioner to have blanket authority
to accept emission factors other than the generally applicable factors given in AP&hyph;42 for SO

 emission calculations from fuel sampling data. To be approvable, 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 must set forth any site-specific
alternative emission factors allowed by the State, and the State must compile sufficient technical support for the
use of those emission factors. Additional site-specific emission factors should not be allowed except through site-specific
SIP revisions, which must support the alternate emission factors with data from a series of emission tests and provide
for periodic reverification of the emission factors' accuracy. In any case, 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 should also clearly
state the approved emission factors and formulae to be used in calculating SO

 emission limitations and recordkeeping requirements for Lake, Marion, Vigo, Wayne, LaPorte, Jefferson, Sullivan,
Vermillion, Floyd, Warrick, Morgan, Gibson, Dearborn, and Porter Counties. The January 11, 1991 submittal contains
minor revisions to 326 IAC 7&hyph;4, which primarily consist of the removal of outdated interim compliance dates
for various sources. The rule also reflects facility name changes that have occurred recently. However, in 326 IAC
7&hyph;4&hyph;1(c)(10), the emission limits for Inland Steel in Lake County have been relaxed. Similarly, the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limits for Bethlehem Steel in Porter County have been relaxed in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;14(1)(C). In the
case of Inland Steel, which is located in an area currently designated as nonattainment for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, section 193 of the Clean Air Act precludes approval of this SIP revision. Section 193, the general savings clause,
states that no SIP requirements in effect in a nonattainment area before the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 may be relaxed unless equivalent or greater emission reductions are made. No emission reductions offsetting
the Inland Steel relaxation have been identified by the State. Both the Inland Steel and the Bethlehem Steel relaxations
are affected by section 110(l) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits USEPA from approving a SIP revision if the revision
would interfere with attainment. The USEPA can approve a SIP revision containing relaxations to existing emission
limitations only if the State provides a modeled attainment demonstration performed according to USEPA guidelines
to show that the relaxed limits will continue to protect the NAAQS. No information has been submitted to USEPA in support
of the relaxed emission limitations for Inland Steel or Bethlehem Steel. Therefore, 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;1(c)(10)
and 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;14(1)(C) cannot be approved.

III. Enforceability: ``Commissioner's Discretion'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rules containing ``Commissioner's discretion'' language allow IDEM's Commissioner to remove or modify federally
enforceable requirements and restrictions for individual facilities. ``Commissioner's discretion'' language
is found in 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, 3&hyph;2.1, 3&hyph;3, 7&hyph;2, and 7&hyph;3. Such language is unacceptable because
it does not provide for USEPA review of rule modifications or exemptions made after USEPA's approval of the original
rule. Modifications to SIP rules may affect an area's attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, and may compromise
the federal enforceability of the SIP limits. In order for ``Commissioner's discretion'' language to be approvable,
any subsequent rule modifications made by the Commissioner must not hamper the SIP's enforceability or ability to
assure the protection and maintenance of the standards. The USEPA may approve the rule if it provides that any modifications
will be submitted to USEPA as SIP revisions, or if the rule explicitly states the criteria which the Commissioner will
use to evaluate any requests for rule modifications or exemptions. Without such provisions, USEPA cannot be certain
that each facility subject to the original rule will comply with all of the rule's requirements. Therefore, rules
containing ``Commissioner's discretion'' language without either federally approved criteria for the expected
modifications or provisions for USEPA review of the modifications cannot be approved and incorporated into the SIP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA is proposing to disapprove Indiana's January 11, 1991 submittal. The rules do not couple the general SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limits with compliance methods or averaging times adequate to ensure continuous compliance and maintenance
of the NAAQS. 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, 3&hyph;2.1, 3&hyph;3, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
7&hyph;2, and 7&hyph;3 contain ``Commissioner's discretion'' language, which could hamper USEPA's ability to
enforce the State rules. 326 IAC 3&hyph;2.1 fails to properly cite the acceptable methodologies for source emission
testing. 326 IAC 7&hyph;4 contains emission limits which are less stringent than the previously approved limits,
and the January 11, 1991 submittal failed to show that the relaxations continue to protect the NAAQS. Because of these
deficiencies, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the January 11, 1991 submittal.

Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments
received by March 10, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this action
remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP
revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted
a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such
time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not
affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing federal requirements remain in
place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State enforceability.
Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies
that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new federal requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations. Requirements applying
to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent
with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean
Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated
pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast
AQMD) is the designated COA. This is the first update of the South Coast AQMD OCS requirements since promulgation of
the OCS Air Regulations on September 4, 1992. The OCS requirements for the South Coast AQMD contained in the Technical
Support Document are proposed to be incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations and are listed
in the appendix to the OCS air regulations. Proposed changes to the existing requirements are discussed below.

On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which established requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain federal
and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. Part 55 applies
to all OCS sources offshore of the States except those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude.
Section 328 of the Act requires that for such sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary, the requirements
shall be the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. Because the OCS requirements are based
on onshore requirements, and onshore requirements may change, section 328(a)(1) requires that EPA update the OCS
requirements as necessary to maintain consistency with onshore requirements.

mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility
in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes
to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to
all of EPA's state implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may
result in the inclusion of state or local rules or regulations in part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately
be disapproved for inclusion as part of the state's SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the
requirements of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the
SIP.

In updating 40 CFR part 55, EPA reviewed the state and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 to ensure that they
are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part
C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that
they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure they are not arbitrary or
capricious. 40 CFR 55.12 (e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and requirements for toxics and the South Coast AQMD's RECLAIM (Regional Clean Air Incentives Market) requirements.

Upon delegation the onshore area will use its administrative and procedural rules as onshore. In those instances
where EPA does not delegate authority to implement and enforce part 55, EPA will use its own administrative and procedural
requirements to implement the substantive requirements. 40 CFR 55.14(c)(4).

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities
include small businesses, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and in the structure of the rule
averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis
for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being
already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis
for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being
already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
have decided to withdraw six proposed rules. These rules appeared between 1989 and 1992 and have subsequently been
determined to be unnecessary, incorporated into other rules, or need further review.

FAR Case 89&hyph;14, Indirect Cost Rate Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule, published March 7, 1989, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 10133), is hereby withdrawn. The rule proposed changes to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.804&hyph;4(i),
42.705&hyph;1, 42.705&hyph;2, and the clause 52.216&hyph;13 to clarify the requirement for certification under
the Truth-in-Negotiations Act for final indirect cost rate agreements. The rule subsequently was determined to
be unnecessary.

FAR Case 89&hyph;21, Inspection for Commercial, Off-the-Shelf Supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule revising FAR 46.202&hyph;1, 46.301, and 46.302 published April 20, 1989, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 16094), is hereby withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal is considered necessary because the subject matter associated with this case has been incorporated with
a case which proposes changes to part 46, including inspection of commercial supplies.

FAR Case 89&hyph;11, Title to Property Under the Progress Payments Clause
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, published May 1, 1989, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 18631), is hereby withdrawn, as agreed upon by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition
Regulations Council. The proposed FAR clarifications published for public comment have been determined to be unnecessary
because the current FAR adequately covers the issues addressed by the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule proposed a change to the progress payments clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;16. The councils published the proposed
rule to assist in assessing whether the FAR should be revised to emphasize that it is and always has been the intent of
the FAR that the interest taken by the Government in property covered by the clause is title in the form of ownership,
and not a mere lien. The Councils have determined that there is no need to clarify the intent of the FAR. Contracts containing
the Progress Payments clause clearly reflect the intention of the parties to grant title to the property to the Government
and not grant merely a lien.

FAR Case 89&hyph;61, Noncommercial Cost Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, published July 28, 1989, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 31480), is hereby withdrawn. The rule proposed revising FAR subparts 31.3, 31.6, and 31.7 to set forth a new rule
on the allowability of costs incurred under Federal contracts with educational institutions, state and local governments,
federally recognized Indian tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations. The statutory prohibitions at 10
U.S.C. 2324(e) on allowable costs under defense contracts have been published in the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement and FAR coverage is not necessary. Civilian agency contracts that are awarded to these noncommercial
entities rely on the cost principles promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget.

FAR Case 91&hyph;17, Contractor Acquisition of Automatic Data Processing Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, published May 3, 1991, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 20507), is hereby withdrawn. This rule proposed raising two dollar thresholds in FAR 31.205&hyph;2 from $500,000
to $1,000,000. The first threshold (31.205&hyph;2(b)(2)(iii)(B)) pertains to the initial decision to lease automatic
data processing equipment (ADPE), which requires contracting officer's approval. The second threshold (31.205&hyph;2(d)(3))
pertains to a contractor requirement to furnish data supporting the annual justification for retaining or changing
existing ADPE capability and the need to continue leasing. Revising the thresholds in FAR 31.205&hyph;2 will be considered
further as a part of a comprehensive review of the cost principle.

FAR Case 91&hyph;67, Employee Stock Ownership Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals rule, published February 4, 1992, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 4181), is hereby withdrawn. The Councils published the proposed rule to clarify that the cost principle at FAR
31.205&hyph;6(j)(8), Employee stock ownership plans, applies to all employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) regardless
of whether or not an ESOP meets the definition of ``pension plan'' in FAR 31.205&hyph;6(j)(1) (i.e., provides a benefit
payable for life). After consideration of public comments and further examination of the issues involved, the Councils
determined that the proposed rule fails to adequately address major issues associated with the allowability of costs
for ESOPs. The Councils plan to address these issues in a future proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The DOE previously used the Cost and Schedule Control System Criteria (CSCSC) to evaluate management systems on selected
contracts. A recent internal directive, DOE Notice 4700.5, Project Control System Guidelines (Notice), revised
the method for applying control systems to the management of projects by expanding upon and replacing the CSCSC. The
new approach includes explicit technical and schedule baseline development and control in addition to cost control.
The previous directive addressing this issue, DOE Order 2250.1D, Cost and Schedule Control Systems Criteria, has
been canceled. DOE Project Managers are responsible for determining the applicability of the Project Control System
and the extent to which the requirements of the Notice will be utilized in individual contracts. Project Managers
will have the flexibility to tailor requirements, encourage formulation of customized project control strategies
for each project or group of projects, and emphasize the appropriate degree of application for each guideline element
to effectively control technical, schedule, and cost risks.

II. Section-by-Section Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A detailed list of changes follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Subpart 912.70 is added to provide guidance for the use of the new Project Control System Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subsection 952.212&hyph;73, Cost and schedule control systems criteria, is amended to incorporate the Project
Control System contract clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;50 is amended to reflect the new Project Control System Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
III. Procedural Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department of Energy has determined that today's regulatory action is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this
action was not subject to review under that executive order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency subject to Executive Order 12291 to adhere to certain requirements
in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections
2(a) and (b), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize
litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and
burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies
clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes
any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of
such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that this proposed rule meets the requirements
of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires
preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule will have no impact on interest rates, tax policies or
liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other direct economic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic
consequences such as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has
been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
No new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this proposed rule. Accordingly, no
OMB clearance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.).

E. Review Under Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12612, entitled ``Federalism,'' 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules,
legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship
between the Federal Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various
levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation
of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action.
This proposed rule will apply to States that contract with DOE; however, none of the revisions is substantive in nature.

F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DOE has concluded that this proposed rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant impact on
the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) (1976)
or the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and, therefore, does not require
an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Interested persons are invited to participate by submitting data, views or arguments with respect to the proposed
DEAR amendments set forth in this notice. Three copies of written comments should be submitted to the address indicated
in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this notice. All comments received will be available for public inspection in the
DOE Reading Room, 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, between
the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. All written comments received on or
before the date specified in the beginning of this notice and all other relevant information will be considered by
DOE before taking final action. Comments received after that date will be considered to the extent that time allows.
Any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential and which may be exempt from public
disclosure should submit one complete copy, as well as an additional copy from which the information claimed to be
confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information or
data and to treat it according to its determination. The Department's generally applicable procedures for handling
information, which has been submitted in a document and may be exempt from public disclosure, are set forth in 10 CFR
1004.11. The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and
that the rule should not have a substantial impact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.
Therefore, pursuant to section 50(c) of the DOE Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7191(c)) and the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is today proposing standards which would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) from existing
and new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations. These proposed national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (1990 amendments),
which requires the Administrator to regulate emissions of the HAP's listed in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (Act).
Several of these pollutants are emitted from all gasoline distribution facilities (pipeline pumping stations,
pipeline breakout stations, bulk terminals, bulk plants, and service stations). The intent of the proposed standards
is to protect the public health by requiring new and existing major sources to control HAP emissions to the level attainable
by the maximum achievable control technology (MACT). Pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals are
the only two subcategories within the gasoline distribution network that have been found to include major source
facilities. Therefore, the proposed standards would apply only to major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk
gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of
data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards for gasoline distribution facilities.

The 1990 amendments require, under Section 112, that the Agency evaluate and control emissions of HAP's. The control
of HAP's is to be achieved through promulgation of emission standards under Sections 112(d) and (f) for categories
of sources that emit HAP's. Pursuant to Section 112(c) of the Act, the Agency published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the initial list of source categories that emit HAP's on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). This list includes major and area
sources of HAP's that the Agency intends to regulate before November of the year 2000. The list reflects the Section
112(a) definition of major source as a source that emits 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any individual HAP or 25 tpy
or more of any combination of HAP's. Area sources are stationary sources that do not qualify as ``major.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial list of major source categories includes the gasoline distribution source category. For purposes of
the proposed standards, the gasoline distribution network refers to the storage and transfer of gasoline as it is
moved from the production refinery process units to the service station storage tank. The gasoline distribution
facility category is made up of several distinct facility types. During the analysis of this category, it was determined
that this category should be subcategorized by facility type. Therefore, the following gasoline distribution subcategories
were analyzed in the context of this proposed rulemaking:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gasoline is carried from production units at refineries to terminals by pipelines, which may span great distances,
or be co-located or adjacent to refineries. The pipeline is made of sections of steel pipe, welded together, and usually
buried underground. At the refinery, a pump sends the refined gasoline toward its destination. Since the primary
pump is incapable of ``pushing'' the gasoline the entire distance, pumping stations are located along the pipeline
to keep the gasoline flowing. Occasionally, flow may be interrupted as a quantity of gasoline is pumped out of the pipeline
into storage tanks. These ``breakout'' stations usually are coincident with pumping stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulk gasoline terminals are facilities that receive gasoline from refineries via pipeline, ship, or barge and place
it in storage tanks until it is distributed. Also, bulk terminals can be located onsite or adjacent to refineries.
At these terminals, gasoline is loaded into railcars (which typically transport gasoline between terminals) or
tank trucks. From the terminal, the tank trucks normally deliver gasoline to service stations or intermediate storage
and handling facilities known as bulk plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulk plants, using smaller delivery tank trucks, primarily supply service stations and small accounts such as farms
because they are long distances from terminals or are unable to accommodate the large terminal delivery tank trucks.
At service stations, gasoline is transferred to storage tanks and ultimately to motor vehicles. Vehicle refueling
(known as Stage II) and ship and barge handling of gasoline are being addressed by the Agency under separate programs.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, section 112(b) of the 1990 amendments contains a list of HAP's to be regulated by Agency standards.
Volatile organic compound (VOC) and HAP emission sources at gasoline distribution facilities have been studied
and regulated by Federal, State, and local air pollution regulatory agencies for some time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in the mid 1970's, the Agency issued control techniques guideline documents (CTGs) for the control of VOC
from sources at several gasoline production and distribution facilities. These CTGs recommended control techniques
for gasoline vapor emissions from service stations (November 1975), tank truck loading terminals (October 1977),
bulk plants (December 1977), fixed-roof petroleum storage tanks (December 1977), external floating roof petroleum
storage tanks (December 1978), and tank trucks (December 1978). The Agency also developed a general volatile organic
liquid storage tank CTG (June 1984), and is in the process of revising this document (July 1992 draft). In addition,
there is a CTG pertaining to the control of VOC from leaking equipment at petroleum refineries (issued in June 1978,
and later superseded by a CTG issued in 1984). Most State and local agencies have implemented rules reflecting the
CTG recommended control technologies in areas with ozone nonattainment problems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The VOC emissions from sources at gasoline distribution facilities have also been addressed in Federal new source
performance standards (NSPS). On March 8, 1974, the Agency promulgated an NSPS (subpart K of 40 CFR part 60) regulating
VOC emissions from new petroleum liquid storage tanks. Subsequent updates (subparts Ka and Kb) require more stringent
control levels for new storage tanks. Subpart Ka was promulgated on April 4, 1980, and subpart Kb on April 8, 1987 (52
FR 11428). Tank truck loading racks at new bulk gasoline terminals are covered by subpart XX of 40 CFR part 60, which
was adopted on August 18, 1983 (48 FR 37578). On May 30, 1984, 40 CFR part 60, subpart GGG (referencing subpart VV provisions)
NSPS were promulgated covering equipment leaks of VOC at petroleum refineries. Additionally, national emission
standards for hazardous air pollutants, 40 CFR part 61, subpart J (referencing subpart V provisions) were promulgated
in June 6, 1984 covering equipment leaks from equipment in benzene service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory emission limits applied in some areas are more stringent than either the CTG or NSPS level. For example,
rules for the Bay Area and Sacramento Air Quality Management Districts in California have bulk gasoline terminal
emission limits that are more stringent than the levels required under the NSPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods for control of HAP emissions from gasoline distribution facilities have also been evaluated in past studies.
In 1978, the Agency studied benzene emissions from gasoline distribution facilities (not including vehicle refueling)
and presented its findings to the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC). After
this presentation, the Agency decided not to proceed with a benzene standard but rather to proceed with the NSPS development
for bulk gasoline terminals. On August 8, 1984, the Agency published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (49 FR 31706) a notice of the availability of a document on regulatory strategies being considered for controlling
air pollutants from bulk gasoline terminals, bulk plants, and service stations. After the public comment period
on the regulatory strategies, a Federal regulation for controlling vehicle refueling (Stage II) emissions with
on the vehicle controls (onboard) was proposed on August 19, 1987, but no control requirements were included for bulk
gasoline terminals, bulk plants, or other sources at service stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 7, 1987, in response to a petition filed in 1984 by the Natural Resources Defense Council, et. al., the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Agency to publish either a notice of intent not to regulate
or a notice of proposed regulation. This order covered several sources of benzene emissions, including bulk gasoline
terminals, bulk plants, and gasoline service stations (including the filling of service station storage tanks by
gasoline tank trucks, but not the refueling of motor vehicles). On September 14, 1989 (54 FR 38083), the Agency proposed
regulations for the gasoline distribution facilities noted above. However, on March 7, 1990 (55 FR 8292), the Agency
withdrew these proposed standards. The rationale for this withdrawal was that the baseline benzene emissions were
found to be within a safe range with regard to health risk, and that additional controls were unnecessary to provide
an ample margin of safety. This earlier decision not to regulate these three types of gasoline distribution facilities
was based on the health effects from benzene alone and were under the provisions of the Act as amended in 1977. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HAP list presented in the Act section 112(b), as amended in 1990, contains additional compounds normally contained
in gasoline vapor, including, but not limited to benzene, toluene, hexane, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, cumene,
xylenes, n-hexane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Additionally, new provisions
on how to develop NESHAP were provided in the 1990 amendments to the Act. Therefore, it became necessary to reevaluate
emissions from gasoline distribution facilities to consider a combination of HAP's and the new provisions for setting
NESHAPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other requirements and regulatory programs that will affect the HAP emissions from gasoline distribution
facilities. These include the major and area source determination provisions for pipeline facilities covered in
section 112(n)(4)(A) of the 1990 amendments, fuel volatility restrictions, and reformulated and oxygenated fuel
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(n)(4)(A) stipulates that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
``emissions from any pipeline compressor or pump station shall not be aggregated with emissions from other similar
units, whether or not such units are in a contiguous area or under common control to determine whether such units or
stations are major sources''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, these facilities were evaluated separately for major source determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has promulgated a program that requires the use of lower volatility blends of gasoline during the summer
months, which will reduce HAP and VOC emissions from the gasoline distribution network.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reformulated and oxygenated fuel requirements in Title II of the Act will affect gasoline composition and the resulting
HAP emissions. Reformulated fuel requirements specify a reduced benzene content, a minimum oxygen content, and
a likely reduction in aromatic components of the blend. Reformulated gasoline is required throughout the year in
the nine worst ozone nonattainment areas in the United States to reduce ozone forming VOC emissions during the summer
months and air toxic emissions (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, POM) year-round from gasoline
vehicles by 15 percent beginning in 1995 and 25 percent in 2000. Other areas may choose to implement the prohibition
provision [Section 211(k)(5) of the 1990 amendments] and thus enter the program as well. Oxygenated fuels program
requires the use of oxygenates in gasoline during the winter months in all carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas
to reduce CO emissions. While significantly decreasing VOC, CO, and air toxics emissions, both the reformulated
and oxygenated fuels programs could lead to an increase in HAP emissions due to the fact that MTBE is listed as a HAP in
the Act section 112(b) of the Act and is expected to be used in a large portion of the market to meet the oxygenate requirements
of these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This increase will come about because to meet minimum oxygen requirements under the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated
fuels programs, approximately 11 percent and 15 percent by volume of MTBE is needed in liquid gasoline, respectively.
Since MTBE is much more volatile than the aromatic compounds that it will replace in the blend, a much higher concentration
of HAP's in the vapor phase of this fuel will result. Therefore, it is expected that the inclusion of MTBE may increase
the HAP/VOC ratio in gasoline vapor from approximately 5 weight percent for normal gasoline to nearly 15 percent for
oxygenated gasoline. The actual increase in HAPs at facilities distributing reformulated gasolines and oxygenated
fuels will depend on the fraction of their fuel containing MTBE as opposed to other oxygenates such as ethanol or ETBE.
Furthermore, while the weight percent of HAP's may increase due to the presence of MTBE, this will be offset to some
extent under the reformulated gasoline program by reducing the toxic air pollutants required by the ACT and the deep
volatility controls expected to result from the reformulated gasoline program during the summer months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above mentioned programs, guidelines, and standards (fuels programs, CTGs, NSPS) were considered, and their
impacts on the gasoline distribution network estimated, before the development of control alternatives for this
proposed rulemaking began. As a consequence, all emission reductions, costs, and other impacts discussed in the
forthcoming sections are incremental to existing control programs.

A. Sources Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sources in the gasoline distribution category are a combination of major sources and area sources. Some pipeline
breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals have been determined to be major sources, since larger breakout stations
and terminals may emit either 10 tpy or greater of individual HAP's (i.e. hexane, MTBE) or 25 tpy or greater of a combination
of HAP's. For purposes of this rulemaking, the Agency is proposing that major source pipeline breakout stations and
bulk gasoline terminals in the gasoline distribution source category be regulated under maximum achievable control
technology (MACT) standards. The following is a summary of the methods used to determine applicability of the proposed
rule.

1. Applicability Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard applies to all major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. Today's
proposed standards provide two ways to determine if a facility is not a major source and not subject to the rule. They
are: (1) The owner or operator provides documentation to the Administrator that the facility is not a major source
as defined in section 112(a) by means of completion of an emissions audit at the facility, or (2) from the result of the

The above equations are not allowed to be used if the bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline facilities are located within
the contiguous area of and under common control with a major source petroleum refinery. For those facilities, they
would demonstrate they are not a major source by providing an emission audit of all emission sources in the facility,
including, but not limited to the refinery process units, wastewater systems, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Emission Points Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Emission points affected at bulk gasoline terminals are storage tanks that contain or have the potential to contain
gasoline, equipment leaks from the piping system that handles gasoline or gasoline vapors, loading racks that load
gasoline into tank trucks or railcars, and gasoline vapor leakage from sealed tank trucks or railcars during loading.
Emission points affected at pipeline breakout stations are individual storage tanks that contain or have the potential
to contain gasoline, and equipment leaks from the entire breakout station piping system that handles gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two types of storage tanks found at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations, fixed-roof
and floating roof tanks. The greatest portion of emissions occurring from fixed-roof tanks are those emitted through
the breather (pressure-vacuum) valve as a result of tank breathing and filling. Floating roof tanks may have either
external or internal floating roofs. The sources of greatest emissions associated with an external floating roof
tank occur as a result of an improper fit between the seals and the tank shell, leaks associated with roof fittings,
and withdrawal losses from evaporation when a wet portion of the tank wall is exposed. Losses from internal floating
roof tanks occur mainly through vents in the metal shell of the tank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pumps and valves are used at pipeline breakout stations to move and route gasoline along the pipeline or to transfer
gasoline to or from breakout station storage tanks. Pumps and valves at bulk gasoline terminals are used to transfer
gasoline from storage tanks to tank trucks or railcars. In addition, other equipment at these facilities, such as
compressors, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, flanges, or other connectors is in gasoline
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loading rack emissions from tank truck or railcar loading operations at bulk gasoline terminals occur when gasoline
being loaded displaces vapors from the cargo tank of the truck or railcar to the atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a potential for emissions due to vapor leakage even from controlled tank trucks or railcars during loading
if their cargo tanks are not vapor-tight. Vapors may leak to the atmosphere from dome cover assemblies, pressure-vacuum
(P&hyph;V) vents, and vapor collection piping and vents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Standards for Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing an equipment standard for storage tanks at new and existing major source bulk gasoline terminals
and pipeline breakout stations. These proposed standards specify new and existing storage tanks comply with the
equipment standards of the NSPS 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, they would require: (1) External floating roof tanks to
have specified types of primary and secondary seals, and (2) fixed-roof tanks to have internal floating roofs with
specific types of primary seals or secondary seals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Agency is proposing an emission limit of 10 milligrams (mg) of total organic compounds (TOC) per
liter of gasoline loaded (10 mg TOC/l) for the process stream outlet of control devices and continuous compliance
monitoring of certain operating parameters of control devices installed at the loading racks of new and existing
major source bulk gasoline terminals. Operating the control device in a manner that exceeds or fails to maintain,
as appropriate, the monitored operating parameter value established during the emission performance test would
be an exceedence of the emission limit. New major source bulk gasoline terminals would also be required to install
vacuum assisted vapor collection equipment on their loading racks where gasoline tank trucks or railcars are loaded.
This system would prevent vapor leakage from tank trucks that can occur due to the pressures normally developed in
fuel compartments during loading.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is also proposing equipment and performance standards for all tank trucks and railcars loading at existing
and new major source bulk gasoline terminals. Trucks and railcars loading at these facilities would be required to
pass an annual vapor tightness test according to EPA Method 27. This requirement controls fugitive vapor losses at
existing facilities and supplements the vacuum assist system at new facilities in providing the best control for
vapor leakage during loading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pumps, valves and other equipment at new major source bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations would
all be subject to the same work practice and equipment standards specified by the leak detection and repair (LDAR)
program in 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. LDAR requirements at bulk gasoline terminals include components of the vapor
collection and processing systems. Existing major source bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations
would be required to perform LDAR for pumps and valves four times per year (quarterly LDAR). New major source facilities
would be required to implement a monthly LDAR program for pumps and valves, and follow the other equipment standards
for other equipment under 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. Provisions of these LDAR programs allow new and existing facilities
with demonstrated low leak frequencies for valves to decrease the frequency of monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When promulgated, these standards will be codified under part 63 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
Proposed General Provisions of part 63 (58 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
42760, August 11, 1993) to be located in subpart A, will, when promulgated, codify procedures and criteria to implement
emission standards for stationary sources that emit one or more HAP's, and will provide general information and requirements
that apply under the section 112 NESHAP promulgated under the CAA amendments of 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

C. Effective Date for Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(i)(3)(A) of the Act requires compliance by existing sources within 3 years after rule promulgation,
notwithstanding the provisions of sections 112(i)(1) and (2). Today's proposed regulation requires compliance
by all affected sources within 3 years after promulgation of the rule. Finally, major source facilities in the bulk
gasoline terminal and pipeline breakout station subcategories must implement LDAR programs within 180 days after
promulgation of this rule. New major source facilities must comply with all provisions of the standards upon startup.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Compliance Extensions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(i)(3)(B) allows the Administrator (or a State with a program approved under Title V) to grant existing
sources an extension of compliance of up to 1 year, upon application by an owner or operator of an affected facility,
if such time period is necessary for the installation of controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, under the early reduction provisions of section 112(i)(5), existing sources may be granted a 6-year
extension of compliance with an otherwise applicable section 112(d) standard (MACT standard) upon demonstration
by the owner or operator of the source that HAP emissions have been reduced by 90 percent or more prior to the date of this
proposal, or the source makes an enforceable commitment to achieve such reduction prior to January 1, 1994. The general
notice governing early reduction compliance extensions was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Compliance Testing and Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tests required under the proposed standards include initial performance testing of the bulk terminal vapor processing
system, vapor leak monitoring and repair of the vapor collection system before each performance test, and annual
vapor tightness testing of gasoline tank trucks and railcars. Storage tanks at terminals and pipeline stations would
require periodic visual and seal gap measurement tests. Continuous monitoring of an operating parameter would be
required for vapor processing systems to ensure continuous compliance with today's proposed 10 mg TOC/l emission
limit. At new bulk gasoline terminals, the vacuum achieved in the tank truck or railcar during loading would have to
be monitored continuously to verify continuous compliance with maintaining the vacuum during truck and railcar
loading operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The schedule for performance testing is provided in &sect;63.7 of the proposed General Provisions. The initial performance
test is required 120 days after the effective date of the standards or after initial startup for a new facility, or 120
days after the compliance date specified for an existing facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Methods 2A, 2B, 25A, and 25B in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60 are specified for measurement of total organic compound emissions
from the vapor collection and processing system. Due to the inherent inability to measure mass emissions from elevated
flares (elevated flare's flame is open to atmosphere and therefore the emissions cannot be routed through stacks),
these test methods are not applicable. Therefore, the Agency has established performance requirements for flares.
These performance requirements, including a limitation on visible emissions, are provided in &sect;63.11 of the
proposed General Provisions, which specifies Method 22 for determining visible emissions from this hard to test
type of flare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before each performance test, the owner or operator would be required to use Method 21 to monitor potential leak sources
in the terminal's vapor collection system during the loading of a gasoline tank truck or railcar. Leaks from the vapor
collection and processing system would have to be repaired before conducting the rest of the performance test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each gasoline tank truck and railcar loading at an affected bulk terminal would have to pass an annual vapor tightness
test using Method 27. This will ensure that fugitive vapor leakage from loading cargo tanks is minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed emission standard includes continuous monitoring of an operating parameter as a requirement for
vapor processing systems to ensure continuous compliance with the proposed 10 mg TOC/l emission limit. The vapor
processing system's operating parameter ``value'' would be established during the initial performance test of
the vapor processor. Exceeding or failures to maintain, as appropriate, that operating parameter value would be
a violation of the emission limit requiring maintenance and repair and documentation in a quarterly report to the
Administrator. The parameters that may be monitored include organic compounds concentration for carbon adsorption
and refrigeration condenser systems, and combustion or condenser temperature for thermal oxidation and refrigeration
condenser systems. An owner or operator may substitute an alternative parameter or vapor processor type upon the
approval of the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At new bulk gasoline terminals installing a vacuum assisted vapor collection system, the proposed standards require
continuous monitoring of the pressure in the collection system, to ensure that a vacuum exists at all times during
loading. No specific vacuum limits are being proposed. As with parameter monitoring of the vapor processing system,
this vacuum monitoring will ensure that fugitive vapor leakage is effectively reduced through the continuous compliance
for the proposed vacuum requirements for the vacuum assist system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pumps, valves, and other specified equipment in the gasoline liquid and vapor transfer lines at bulk gasoline
terminals and pipeline breakout stations may be sources of fugitive HAP emissions. The proposed standards include
a requirement for an LDAR program in which pumps and valves are manually monitored using a portable VOC detector on
a periodic basis, and then repaired if a leak is found. Under the proposed standards, monitoring would initially be
carried out monthly at new facilities and quarterly at existing facilities. Provisions are included to reduce monitoring
frequencies for valves on the basis of demonstrated low leak rates. When a leak is detected (meter reading of 10,000
ppm on a portable organic monitor), the owner or operator would have 5 calendar days in which to make an initial repair
attempt, and 15 calendar days in which to complete the repair. Other equipment in gasoline liquid or vapor service
at new facilities are required to have specified equipment.

F. Recordkeeping and Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards require four types of reports: initial notification, notification of compliance status,
periodic reports, and other reports. The initial notification report apprises the regulatory authority of applicability
for existing sources or of construction for new sources. This report also includes a statement as to whether the facility
can achieve compliance by the required compliance date. The notification of compliance status demonstrates that
compliance has been achieved. This report contains the results of the initial performance test, which includes calculation
of the monitored operating parameter value for the vapor processor, and a list of equipment subject to the standard.
Periodic reports submitted quarterly would specify exceedences of the emission standards, such as when the monitored
operating parameter of a vapor processor is outside the value established during the performance test. Other periodic
reports, which are submitted semiannually, include LDAR program and annual storage vessel inspection results.
Certain additional reporting is occasionally necessary because a short-term response may be needed from the reviewing
authority. For example, the Administrator may request more frequent reports of monitored operating parameter or
LDAR data if it is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the standard.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Records required under the proposed standards must be kept at the facility for 5 years. These include records of tank
truck and railcar vapor tightness test certifications, as well as monitoring data from the vapor processor and from
the vacuum assist system at new bulk gasoline terminals. Records from the LDAR program and storage vessel inspections,
and records of startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the vapor processor are required to ensure that the controls
in place are continuing to be effective.

A. Number and Type of Affected Sources or Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1998, the base year of the analysis, it is estimated that there will be approximately 403,600 facilities in the entire
gasoline distribution network. However, only two subcategories within the network (pipeline breakout stations
and bulk gasoline terminals), comprising a total of 1,300 facilities, are being addressed by this rulemaking. Of
this total, it is estimated that about 20 pipeline breakout stations and about 280 bulk gasoline terminals qualify
as major sources and therefore would be subject to today's proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of the analysis conducted in connection with these standards, all facilities built or reconstructed
between today's proposal and the 1998 base year are considered ``new'' facilities in the base year analysis (see proposed
General Provisions, subpart A of 40 CFR part 63). All other facilities prior to proposal were considered to be ``existing''
sources in this analysis. The estimated impacts of the levels of control specified by the proposed regulation within
each subcategory are discussed below.

The base year population of existing pipeline breakout stations is estimated to be about 245 facilities (18 major
source sites, 227 area source sites). Sources of emissions at these facilities arise from gasoline storage and various
equipment components in the process line piping. Under the proposed regulation, each existing major source pipeline
breakout station would be required to implement a quarterly LDAR program for leaks from pumps and valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the 18 major source facilities would be required to retrofit external floating roof tanks with primary
and secondary seals and install internal floating roofs with primary seals on fixed-roof tanks. It is estimated that
35 external floating roof storage tanks and 11 fixed-roof storage tanks at these major source sites would need to be
upgraded to meet these equipment standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that in 1998, there will be 737 bulk gasoline terminals that qualify as ``existing'' sources. It is
further estimated that nearly 200, or 27 percent, will qualify as major sources. Under the proposed standards, existing
major sources would be required to meet a 10 mg TOC/liter of gasoline loaded limit on their loading rack emissions.
It is estimated that 33 percent of the loading racks at existing bulk gasoline terminals will already be meeting this
level of control. Therefore, 134 of these facilities (the remaining 67 percent) would need to newly install, replace,
or otherwise upgrade their control devices to meet this proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that there are approximately 1,600 storage tanks at existing major source bulk gasoline terminals.
Furthermore, it is estimated that 400 external floating roof tanks and 500 fixed-roof tanks already have controls
that satisfy the proposed standards (i.e., primary and secondary seals on external floating roof tanks and internal
floating roofs with primary seals installed in all fixed-roof tanks). Consequently, it is estimated that approximately
470 external floating roof tanks and 210 fixed-roof tanks would need to improve their control level to meet the proposed
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 31,600 tank trucks and approximately 400 railcars that load at existing bulk gasoline terminals.
It is estimated that 22,400 tank trucks are already subject to annual vapor tightness testing and nearly all of the
remaining 9,200 are not tested. The proposed regulation would require all tank trucks and railcars loading at major
source facilities to be vapor tightness tested annually using Method 27. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essentially no terminals have been determined to routinely use an instrument to detect leaks from equipment (pumps
and valves). Under the proposed standards, all existing major source bulk gasoline terminals would be required to
implement the quarterly LDAR program for pumps and valves discussed previously for pipeline breakout stations.

2. New Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that there will be 10 storage tanks classified as new at the 2 new major source pipeline breakout stations
through base year 1998. Although these tanks would be subject to these standards, they are also subject to the existing
NSPS standard as defined in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that there will be nearly 80 major source bulk gasoline terminals subject to the new facility requirements
of the proposed regulation (28 percent of the base year major source bulk gasoline terminals). The proposed standards
would limit loading rack HAP emissions from these sources to 10 mg TOC/liter instead of 35 mg TOC/liter as under the
NSPS standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with pipeline breakout stations, the projected 600 storage tanks at new major source bulk gasoline terminals would
be subject to this regulation (as well as the NSPS for storage tanks) with the same levels of control outlined previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All new major source bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations would also be required to implement a
monthly LDAR program to control equipment leaks from pumps and valves, as well as implement other 40 CFR part 60, subpart
VV standards for other equipment. Lastly, new major source bulk gasoline terminals would be required to install,
operate, and maintain a vacuum assist vapor collection system on their loading racks that fill gasoline tank trucks
or railcars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the existing gasoline distribution network (approximately 390,000 facilities in base year 1998), the nationwide
baseline HAP emissions are estimated to be 46,000 Mg/yr. Of this total, 8 percent or 4,200 Mg/yr can be attributed to
major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. Implementation of the proposed regulation
would reduce these emissions to approximately 43,400 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
Mg/yr.

2. New Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For new sources through 1998, total nationwide HAP emissions from gasoline distribution facilities, approximately
13,000 total facilities, are estimated to be about 6,700 Mg/yr at baseline. The HAP emissions from pipeline breakout
stations and bulk gasoline terminals account for 46 percent of this total (major sources contribute 12 percent of
the total). The proposed regulation would reduce these emissions to a total of approximately 6,200 Mg/yr.

C. Secondary Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since implementation of the proposed regulation would encompass no additional water discharges, there would be
no negative impact on water quality. There is a potential for a positive benefit to water quality, however, due to decreased
amounts of gasoline entering drains, sewers, and waste sumps because of improved leakage control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is projected to be no significant solid waste or noise impact as a result of implementation of the proposed regulation.
Neither flares, thermal oxidizers, nor refrigeration condenser systems generate any solid waste as a by-product
of their operation. The only solid waste that may be generated is spent activated carbon if carbon adsorption is chosen
by an owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal for loading rack emission control. It is estimated that, in this
case, the total environmental impact would average about 680 kilograms of carbon per year for each bulk terminal choosing
this option. Therefore, the solid waste impact can be considered to be small. This impact would be minimized if the
carbon were reactivated and reused. The Agency has also tested the noise level from vapor processors, and found these
levels to be moderate (less than 70 db at 7 meters).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of vapor recovery systems on loading racks at bulk gasoline terminals, and pollution prevention measures
such as equipment standards for storage tanks and implementation of LDAR programs for equipment components will
all keep gasoline in the system that would have escaped as emissions to the atmosphere. Nationwide annual gasoline
savings are estimated to total 2.34 million gallons at pipeline breakout stations and 12 million gallons at bulk gasoline
terminals.

E. Cost Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Total capital and annualized control costs (third quarter 1990 dollars), including recovery credits, have been
estimated for both existing and new sources. The control costs of the proposed regulation at existing facilities
is estimated to require a total capital investment of $93 million, with an annualized cost of $8.4 million per year.
The implementation costs of the proposed regulation will be lower for new facilities than for existing facilities
primarily due to the smaller estimated number of new facilities (26 percent of the total number, encompassing both
subcategories) and because new storage tanks are regulated by an existing NSPS standard and require no additional
retrofit under the proposed standards. As a consequence, the control costs of the proposed regulation at new facilities
is estimated to result in a total capital investment of $32 million, with annualized costs of approximately $7.4 million
per year. Additional implementation costs for the reporting and recordkeeping requirements under the proposed
rule are estimated to be 4 million.

F. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards were analyzed with regard to their impact on gasoline price and consumption, facility closures,
and declines in employment. While the proposed standards require additional control only at bulk gasoline terminals
and pipeline breakout stations, facilities downstream from terminals and breakout stations might be affected by
the regulation due to higher gasoline wholesale prices and reduced consumption. The national average base year increase
in the price of retail motor gasoline as a result of the proposed standards is estimated at $0.001 per gallon. The national
base year decline in gasoline consumption is estimated at less than 100 million gallons (0.08 percent). The base year
facility closure estimate is nearly 650, more than 90 percent of which is projected for the service station sector.
While the number of service station closures is estimated to be in the hundreds, it should be noted that a total of over
380,000 stations is projected in the base year, so that the number of facilities that might close constitutes less
than 0.2 percent. Furthermore, due to a consumption-spurred projection of modest industry growth from 1993 to 1998,
some closures due to the regulation may be more accurately interpreted as reductions in new facility openings rather
than closures of existing facilities. Employment reductions due to reduced consumption and facility closures are
estimated at just over 1,100 jobs, 70 percent of which are projected for the service station sector. However, this
constitutes only around 0.05 percent of the base year service station sector employment. For the same reason given
for facility closures, some employment reductions may be more accurately interpreted as reductions in industry
job opportunities rather than losses of existing jobs.

A. Authority for Development of the NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title III of the 1990 amendments was enacted to help reduce the increasing amount of nationwide air toxics emissions.
Under Title III, section 112 was amended to give the Agency the authority to establish national standards to reduce
air toxic emissions from sources that emit one or more HAP's. Section 112(b) contains a list of HAP's, which are the
specific air toxics to be regulated by the standards developed under section 112. Section 112(c) directs the Agency
to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of source categories for which the NESHAP will be developed.
The Agency must list all known categories and subcategories of ``major sources'' defined earlier as those sources
that emit 10 tons/yr or greater of individual HAP's or 25 tons/yr or greater of any combination of HAP's. Area source
categories selected by the Agency for the NESHAP development will be based on the Administrator's judgment that the
sources in a category, individually or in aggregate, pose a ``threat of adverse effects to health and the environment.''
The initial list of source categories was published on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions from both new and existing sources pursuant to section 112(d)
of the Act. The Act requires the standards to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP's achievable
for new or existing sources. Each NESHAP must reflect consideration of the cost of achieving the emission reduction,
any non-air quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. The emission reduction may be accomplished
through application of measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques including, but not limited to, measures
that:

C. Regulatory Development Process for the NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During development of a NESHAP, the Agency collects information about the industry, including information on emission
source characteristics, control technologies, data from HAP emission tests at well-controlled facilities, and
information on the cost, energy, and other environmental impacts of emission control techniques. The Agency uses
this information in the development of possible regulatory approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the source category contains major sources, then a MACT standard is required. The level of control corresponding
to the MACT ``floor'' needs to be determined as a boundary for developing the regulatory alternatives. (Procedures
for determining MACT floors are discussed in part D of this section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the floor has been determined for new and existing sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator must
set MACT standards that are no less stringent than the floor level. Such standards must then be met by all sources within
the category or subcategory. However, in establishing standards, the Administrator may distinguish among classes,
types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory [Clean Air Act Section 112(d)(1)]. Thus, for example,
the Administrator could establish two classes of sources within a category or subcategory based on size and establish
a different emission standard for each class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Act provides the Administrator further flexibility in regulating area sources. Section 112(d)(5)
provides that, in lieu of establishing MACT standards under Section 112(d), the Administrator may promulgate standards
that provide for the use of ``generally available control technologies or management practices'' (GACT standards).
Area source standards promulgated under this authority are not subject to the MACT ``floors'' described in part D
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in establishing a MACT or GACT standard is the development and analysis of regulatory alternatives.
First, information about the industry is analyzed to develop model plant parameters and populations for the purpose
of projecting national impacts, including HAP emission reduction levels, costs, and energy and secondary environmental
impacts. Several regulatory alternative levels (which may be different levels of emission control, different applicability
cutoffs, or both) are then evaluated to determine the most appropriate regulatory alternative to reflect the MACT
or GACT level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, although the NESHAP are normally structured in terms of numerical emission limits, alternative approaches
are sometimes necessary (e.g., source testing may be impossible or at least impractical due to technological and
economic limitations). In these cases, work practice or equipment standards may be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Agency's decision-making process, the regulatory alternatives considered for new versus existing sources
may be different and each alternative must be technically achievable. In selecting a regulatory alternative to represent
MACT or GACT, the Agency considers the achievable reduction in HAP emissions; the cost of control; and economic, energy,
and other environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selected regulatory alternative is then translated into a proposed regulation. The regulation implementing
the MACT or GACT decision typically includes Sections addressing applicability, standards, test methods and compliance
demonstration, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The preamble to the proposed regulation, published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provides an explanation of the rationale for the decision. The public is invited to comment on the proposed regulation
during the public comment period. Following an evaluation of these comments, the Agency reaches a decision and promulgates
the final standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Determining Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) ``Floors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the Agency has identified the specific source categories or subcategories of major sources and area sources
that it intends to regulate under section 112, MACT standards are set at a level at least as stringent as the ``floor'',
unless the decision has been made to regulate area sources under section 112(d)(5). Congress has provided certain
very specific directives to guide the Agency in the process of determining the regulatory floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress specified that the Agency must establish standards which require ``the maximum degree of reduction in emissions
of the hazardous air pollutants *&blank;*&blank;* that the Administrator *&blank;*&blank;* determines is achievable
*&blank;*&blank;*''

baseline (floor) at which standards may be set, as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The gasoline distribution facility category is made up of several facility types, which taken together form the gasoline
distribution network. The pollutants emitted at each of the facilities in the gasoline distribution network are
essentially the same. These emissions consist of a mixture of organic compounds (essentially all of which qualify
as VOC under the Agency's definition). Section 112(b) of the Act contains a list of HAP's for which the Agency has been
directed to set national emission standards. A comparison of profiles of normal gasoline vapors to the HAP list reveals
several compounds common to both. Benzene, toluene, hexane, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, cumene, all three chemical
orientations of xylene (para, meta, and ortho), n-hexane, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane) appear on both
lists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211 of the Act contains provisions that will affect gasoline composition in the 1998 base year and, therefore,
the HAP emissions from gasoline distribution sources. This section of the Act requires that fuels purchased and sold
in nonattainment areas contain higher levels of oxygenates (reformulated and oxygenated fuel programs). While
the focus of these fuels programs is the reduction of both tailpipe (combustion) and evaporative emissions of CO and
air toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and POM) emissions from gasoline vehicles, the
intent of today's proposed rule is to reduce major stationary source evaporative HAP emissions from gasoline distribution
facilities. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is projected to be a major source of oxygen that will be added to gasoline
to meet the oxygenate content requirements for the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels programs. MTBE is
also listed in Section 112(b) as a HAP.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576), the Agency published an initial list of source categories that emit HAP's, in response
to Section 112(c) of the Act. In this listing, the gasoline distribution network was included as a major source but
was not listed as a category whose area source facilities were to be considered for regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's subsequent analysis (summarized in the background information document (BID)) of HAP emissions from
all subcategories of the gasoline distribution network concluded that only two of these subcategories, pipeline
breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals, contained major sources and should therefore be considered for regulation
under Section 112(d). All the other subcategories of the network (pipeline pumping stations, bulk plants, and service
stations) encompass only area sources and as a consequence were not included in the proposed standards. These sources
will be studied and may be considered for regulation at a future date pursuant to the urban area source provisions of
Section 112(c)(3) of the Act. Public comments and data are specifically requested on today's proposal to exclude
area sources in this rulemaking and on the analysis contained in the BID to estimate emissions for determining area
and major source facilities. Also, the Agency is specifically requesting any data that would document that any service
station, bulk plant, or pipeline pumping station could be considered a major source of HAP's.

B. Selection of Emission Points Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would regulate all HAP emission points at major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk
gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in Section III.A.2, there are two HAP emission source types at pipeline breakout stations. These sources
are: (1) Equipment leaks from pumps, valves, and other components, and (2) losses from storage tanks. Both of these
sources can be significant sources of emissions. Of the total of nearly 7,200 Mg/yr baseline HAP emissions from gasoline
at pipeline breakout stations, it is estimated that 12 percent can be attributed to equipment leaks and 88 percent
is emitted from storage tanks. Emissions from pumps arise from liquid gasoline leaking from packed or mechanical
seals in the pumps used to move the product through the pipeline. Leaks also occur from seals around stems of valves
and other equipment components that control or isolate gasoline from the environment such as connections, drain
lines, and pressure relief devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage tanks at breakout stations may be of either fixed-roof, external floating roof, or fixed-roof with an internal
floating roof construction. Emissions from fixed-roof tanks consist of breathing and working losses. Breathing
loss is a vapor loss due to expansion or contraction of the vapor space in the tank above the liquid because of daily changes
in temperature or barometric pressure. These emissions may occur in the absence of any liquid level change in the tank.
Working losses consist of emptying and filling losses. Emptying losses occur during the expansion of air that is drawn
into the tank during liquid removal. This air becomes saturated with hydrocarbon vapor and, when it expands due to
changes in temperature or barometric pressure, exceeds the fixed capacity of the vapor space. Overflow then occurs
through the pressure-vacuum valve. Filling losses occur when incoming gasoline displaces air and vapors through
vents to the atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standing-storage losses, which result from causes other than a change in the liquid level, constitute the major source
of emissions from external floating roof tanks. The largest potential source of these losses is an improper fit between
the floating roof seal and the tank shell (seal loss). Withdrawal loss is another source of emissions from floating
roof tanks. When liquid is withdrawn from a tank, the floating roof is lowered and a wet portion of the tank wall is exposed.
Withdrawal loss equals the amount of liquid vaporized from the wet tank wall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standing-storage losses from internal floating roof tanks arise through a somewhat different mechanism due to the
enclosed design of the tanks. As ambient air flows over the exterior of the tank, it flows into the enclosed space between
the fixed and floating roofs through some of the shell vents and flows out of the enclosed space through others. Any
vapors that have evaporated from the exposed liquid surface and that have not been contained by the floating deck are
swept out of the enclosed space. The withdrawal loss from an internal floating roof tank is similar to that discussed
for tanks with external floating roofs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are four contributors to HAP emissions at bulk gasoline terminals, all of which contribute significantly to
the overall totals: (1) From loading racks when gasoline is loaded into tank trucks or railcars (about 18 percent of
the nationwide baseline total of 16,500 Mg/yr HAP emissions from bulk gasoline terminals), (2) fugitive leakage
of vapors from tank trucks or railcars during loading of gasoline (23 percent of baseline total), (3) evaporation
of gasoline from storage tanks (33 percent of the baseline total), and (4) equipment leaks from pumps, valves, and
other components (26 percent of baseline values). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions occur at loading racks when gasoline that is loaded into cargo tanks of trucks or railcars displaces vapors
inside these containers. These emissions may occur either uncontrolled (when facilities are not using vapor collection
and processing equipment) from tank truck or railcar cargo compartments, or from the outlet vents of control systems
used to process these displaced vapors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even at controlled loading racks (ones equipped with vapor collection and processing systems), fugitive emissions
from leaking truck transport tanks or railcars may occur through the dome covers, pressure-vacuum relief valves
or vents, and several other potential sources. The dome or hatch cover designed to seal each cargo compartment during
transport and during loading and unloading operations can develop leaks over time. Valves, which include the pressure-vacuum
(P&hyph;V) vent under the dome plate assembly and the vent valve connected to the overturn rail on tank trucks, can
leak if they become dirty or worn. Improperly installed or damaged hose couplings can also be sources of vapor emissions.
The transport tank shell, if damaged, also can produce vapor emissions from cracks or failures in welds. This latter
type of leak occurs less frequently than those at the dome cover and vents, but may be a large emission source for some
transport tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage tank and equipment component (pumps and valves) leak emissions at bulk gasoline terminals are identical
in the manner of their occurrence to those described earlier for pipeline breakout stations. However, HAP emission
reductions are not the same due to differences in turnover rates and storage tank sizes as well as differences in the
numbers of estimated equipment components in the process line piping between the two facility types.

C. Selection of the Basis for the Proposed Standards for New and Existing Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the present time, a majority of sources within the gasoline distribution network are being controlled under State
regulations and Federal new source performance standards (approximately one-third of the storage tanks at pipeline
breakout stations; one-half of the storage tanks, nearly 70 percent of loading racks, and most of the tank trucks and
railcars that load at bulk gasoline terminals). However, since the States are required to adopt regulations consistent
with CTG recommendations only in areas not attaining the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone,
many States have regulations that cover only those areas. Today's proposed standards will require more stringent
emission control levels for major source facilities located in areas designated as ozone nonattainment, and will
extend the same controls to major source facilities located in attainment areas.

1. Determination of Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine which pipeline breakout stations or bulk gasoline terminals are to be regulated (i.e., which ones are
classified as major sources), owners and operators of these facilities either may provide documentation to the Administrator
that the facility is not a major source as defined in section 112(a) by means of completion of an emissions audit or may
employ one of the equations discussed later in this section that have been developed for estimating facility emissions.
However, regardless of the applicability criteria equation that is chosen, bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline
breakout stations that are located within the contiguous area and under common control with a petroleum refinery
are considered major sources if that petroleum refinery is a major source. This is because refinery process equipment
in combination with bulk terminal and pipeline breakout station equipment is likely to emit more than the threshold
levels for major source determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, the Agency considered a throughput cutoff determination for distinguishing major source from area source
facilities in each subcategory. However, for pipeline breakout stations, HAP emissions are a function of the number
of individual emission sources (storage tanks, pumps, and valves), while emissions from bulk gasoline terminals
occur from these sources as well as from sources which depend upon gasoline throughput (loading racks and tank truck
or railcar leakage). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since major source determinations are not based solely on throughput at each facility type, another approach was
investigated for distinguishing between major and area sources. Equations were developed to estimate total HAP
emissions from both bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations. The equation approach allows a potential
subject facility to input the type of equipment present at the facility and calculate emissions accordingly. These
equations were developed to include all potential equipment; however, if a particular portion of the equation does
not apply (e.g., no fixed-roof tanks), then that portion of the equation will equal zero and fall out of the calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At first, several equations were developed to attempt to cover many different equipment combinations, different
HAP contents in gasoline emissions, and the two major source criteria, 10 tons of a single HAP or 25 tons of combination
of HAPs. One equation was developed for each subcategory that would handle normal gasoline (estimated HAP content
of 4.8 percent), a second set of equations was developed for each facility handling reformulated or oxygenated fuels
(estimated HAP emission content of 16 percent) and a third set of equations was developed for each facility handling
the single-HAP (estimated to be gasoline vapor with MTBE with a HAP content of 12 percent).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial equations were simplified to match the desired approach to provide a simple and reasonable set of equations
to distinguish between area and major sources. The initial equations were simplified and narrowed through testing
the equations against different model facility parameters and assumptions. Consequently, the original equations
were reduced to a limited number of equipment parameter variables and reduced to one equation for bulk terminals and
another for pipeline breakout stations. The resulting equations presented below are determined by the Agency to
capture all major sources under the realistic mix of facility equipment and operating parameters.

2. Determination of Floor Control Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A boundary in the formulation of the regulatory alternatives is a determination of the MACT floor for new and existing
sources. The statutory requirements for determining these floors was previously discussed in section V.D of this
preamble. Selection of floor levels of control using the statutory criteria is described in the following subsections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Loading racks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In many of the areas where bulk terminal loading rack controls are mandated authorities have imposed control requirements
more stringent than the limit of 80 mg TOC per liter of gasoline loaded recommended in the CTG for bulk gasoline terminals.
A summary of State regulations pertaining to gasoline tank truck loading indicated that some terminals currently
are operating under a 10 mg TOC per liter limitation in parts of California. In addition, the NSPS for tank truck loading
at bulk gasoline terminals (subpart XX of 40 CFR part 60) limits emissions to 35 mg/liter. There are currently three
types of vapor processor systems, refrigeration condensers, carbon adsorbers, and thermal oxidation systems,
used to meet these three control requirement emission limits. Each type of control can be specifically designed to
meet each limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To establish the control requirements for new sources the Agency is required to select controls not less stringent
(floor) than the control achieved in practice by the best similar source. The best performing control systems at similar
sources, or systems achieving the maximum degree of reduction in emissions, are those systems designed and operated
to meet the 10 mg TOC per liter standard. Therefore, control systems achieving the 10 mg TOC per liter limit are considered
the floor control level for new sources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To establish the limit for existing sources the Agency is required to select a limitation no less stringent (floor)
than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of sources. To support setting the
floor for existing sources the Agency collected information on the number of facilities under each control requirement
and the results of the measured emission rates achieved during performance tests of vapor processors at over 100 bulk
gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that 70 percent of the approximately 1,000 terminals nationwide are required to meet one of the three
levels of control requirements, 10, 35, and 80 mg TOC per liter of gasoline loaded. Performance test data were collected
for terminals subject to each of those three levels. Performance test data collected from vapor processors at terminals
regulated by the 10 mg standard all met the 10 mg limit, but less than 3 percent of terminals are subject to a 10 mg emission
limitation. The majority (about 70 percent) of performance test data collected from terminals under the 35 mg NSPS
standard achieved less than 10 mg TOC per liter. This indicates that the 10 mg standard is achievable by processors
designed to achieve the 35 mg standard. About 40 percent of the terminals are subject to the 35 mg standard. Therefore,
the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources is a 10 mg standard,
thus 10 mg limit is the floor control level for existing bulk gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tank truck and railcar vapor leakage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CTG detailing control of fugitive emissions from tank trucks recommends that cargo tanks be tested for vapor leakage
on an annual basis, and repaired as necessary. Also, the bulk terminal tank truck loading NSPS (subpart XX of 40 CFR
part 60) requires that tank trucks that load gasoline at bulk gasoline terminals be ``vapor-tight;'' that is, they
must pass an annual vapor tightness test in accordance with Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A second form of leak
testing is carried out by the Department of Transportation (DOT), whose required annual leak tightness testing specifies
pressurization of the cargo tank to 80 percent of its maximum allowable working pressure. The DOT considers Method
27 to be an acceptable alternative to its own pressure test. However, since the relief vents on each fuel compartment
(which have been found to be the major sources of vapor leakage) are capped off during the DOT test, this test is considered
less stringent than Method 27 pressure test. Also, the DOT test does not include a vacuum test as specified in Method
27. The Agency estimates that over 70 percent of existing tank trucks are required to pass the annual vapor tightness
testing using Method 27. It has also been determined that the same test can be applied to railcars.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through contacts with one State control agency, the Agency discovered a system that provides additional control
of vapor losses from cargo tanks. In this system, a negative pressure is created in the vapor collection system during
loading, ensuring that vapors will not be forced out into the air through any leakage points. This ``vacuum assist''
system is in use at a few bulk gasoline terminals (in addition to Method 27 testing) in Texas, so it meets the Act requirement
to consider the best controlled similar source in establishing the floor level of control for new terminals. Since
less than 1 percent of terminals use this vacuum assist system it is not considered the floor for tank trucks at existing
terminals. Annual vapor tightness testing using Method 27 is the next highest or best emission level and therefore
represents the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources as specified
in the Act. Therefore, annual vapor tightness testing using Method 27 is considered the floor for tank trucks loading
at existing terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources have expressed concerns regarding the operational reliability of a vacuum assist system, especially
under extreme cold weather conditions. These commenters also believe that the system could present a safety hazard
if excess negative pressures were developed within a tank truck fuel compartment. To the Agency's knowledge, the
systems in operation have not experienced any significant problems, and one of the systems has been operating for
over 2 years. These systems contain safety pressure relief devices in combination with the pressure-vacuum vents
already installed on each tank truck compartment. However, safety concerns are important to the Agency. The Agency
specifically requests comment, including technical documentation and data where available, on the reliability,
effectiveness, safety aspects, and any other issue concerning vacuum producing equipment for bulk terminal vapor
collection systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis that this technology has been demonstrated, the Agency has selected the vacuum assist system for the loading
of tank trucks and railcars at new bulk gasoline terminals (in combination with the 10 mg TOC/liter emission limit
and continuous monitoring of the vapor processing system) as the floor level of control for fugitive cargo tank leakage
at new facilities.

Equipment leaks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control of emissions from equipment components leaking liquid or vapors at pipeline breakout stations and bulk
gasoline terminals has never been specifically addressed by the Agency in a federal regulation or in a CTG. The Agency
has determined, based on information obtained on site visits and from various industry contacts, that many facilities
conduct periodic visual inspections to identify leaking components, and a few (less than one percent) perform leak
detection and repair (LDAR) programs with a portable organic vapor analyzer. Therefore, the existing facility floor
for the control of emissions from leaking equipment components at both pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline
terminals was determined to be periodic visual inspections, or no formal (federally enforceable) inspection procedure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control of emissions from leaking equipment components at other facilities with similarities to pipeline breakout
stations and bulk gasoline terminals has been studied extensively. LDAR programs to conduct periodic monitoring
of these components are in effect for many types of sources, including equipment in VOC service at petroleum refineries
(40 CFR part 60, subparts GGG and VV) and equipment operated in volatile hazardous air pollutant (VHAP) service (40
CFR part 61, subparts J and V). These programs include monthly inspections of pumps and valves involving the use of
a portable organic vapor analyzer to identify leaking components, a protocol for tagging leaking components, and
a time limit for performing repairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the frequency of monitoring that would reflect best control of these emission sources, the Agency
found that some bulk gasoline terminals are already carrying out equipment leak monitoring with a portable organic
analyzer. Some of these programs involve quarterly monitoring, while others involve monthly monitoring. Bulk gasoline
terminals co-located with or within the contiguous area of refineries are performing LDAR under 40 CFR part 60, subparts
GGG and VV and 40 CFR part 61, subparts J and V. Since these similar source control requirements are achieved in practice
the Agency has selected an LDAR program based on 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV as the floor level of control for equipment
leaks at new bulk gasoline terminals and breakout stations. The proposed standards require monthly leak monitoring
of pumps, no detectible emissions from pressure relief valves (after overpressure release to insure proper reseating
of valve), barrier fluid systems for compressors, closed-purge or closed-vent systems for sampling collection
systems, and caps or plugs for open-ended valves or lines. Requirements for valves are that they be monitored monthly,
with provisions allowing the monitoring frequency for valves that do not leak for 2 successive months to be relaxed
from monthly to quarterly. Additionally, an alternative standard for valves allows for equal to or less than 2 percent
of all valves to leak above the detection limit, and contains procedures that allow monitoring frequency to decrease
from monthly to either quarterly or to annually.

Storage tanks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NSPS standards have been promulgated (40 CFR part 60, subparts K, Ka, and Kb) that cover new, modified, and reconstructed
petroleum and volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage tanks, and CTG recommendations have been implemented for existing
storage tanks in ozone nonattainment areas. The requirements specify that external floating roof tanks be equipped
with certain primary and secondary seals and that fixed-roof tanks be equipped with internal floating roofs with
certain types of seals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following an analysis of State regulations, the Agency estimated that approximately 76 percent of the storage tanks
at pipeline breakout stations are of external floating roof design, while 24 percent are of fixed-roof construction.
The corresponding numbers for storage tanks at bulk gasoline terminals are 53 and 47 percent, respectively. Further
analysis showed that of the external floating roof tanks at pipeline breakout stations, 36 percent have the NSPS and
CTG required primary and secondary seals, while 64 percent have only primary seals. At bulk gasoline terminals, the
numbers are 43 and 57 percent for the respective seal types. Similarly, of the fixed-roof tanks at pipeline breakout
stations, it was estimated that 38 percent have internal floating roofs (72 percent at bulk gasoline terminals) as
required by NSPS and recommended by the CTG, while 62 percent are uncontrolled at pipeline breakout stations (28 percent
at bulk gasoline terminals). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above analysis, the most recent NSPS standard (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb) represents the average emission
limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources. Thus the floor level of control for storage
tanks at both existing pipeline breakout stations and existing bulk gasoline terminals has been determined to be
the control level defined in subpart Kb. Since it has not been demonstrated that, in practice, there are any better
controls than this level for storage tanks, the level of control defined by 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb was also selected
as the floor level of control for storage tanks at new pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Degassing and cleaning of tank bottom sediments are necessary to safely retrofit the different or additional seals
on existing tanks to meet the floor level of control (subpart Kb requirements). Degassing and cleaning of the bottom
of the tank are routine maintenance practices that have been reported to occur at least every ten years. Degassing
and cleaning also results in air emissions. As discussed earlier in this preamble, section 112(i)(3) in the Act allows
for up to three years to comply with this standard and an additional one-year permit extension. Also there is the additional
time between proposal and promulgation. During this three to five year period, it is logical to assume that many of
the tanks requiring the retrofit of controls will be experiencing their routine maintenance cleaning and degassing;
these tanks could be retrofitted during this time. Thus, for these tanks the retrofitting required by this proposal
would not result in earlier degassing and cleaning emissions than would otherwise occur. For those tanks that would
not be degassed or cleaned during that period, degassing and cleaning emissions would be required by this proposed
rule to occur earlier than normal. This early emissions increase is estimated to be more than off-set by the emission
reductions achieved from the required improved seals. Comments and data are requested on any situations where estimated
emissions increase will not be off-set by the emission reduction achieved by the controls; for these situation, the
data should include the number and description of tanks in this atypical situation, their existing equipment and
maintenance history, determinations of the emissions and costs for tank degassing and cleaning, and the basis for
any calculations.

The floor level of control for existing storage tanks was discussed earlier and was determined to be the level of control
achieved under the NSPS subpart Kb. Gasoline storage tanks meeting the control level in subpart Kb were determined
to represent the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources.
Comments and data are specifically requested on the number of gasoline storage tanks at these facilities with seal
types meeting subpart Kb.

After establishing the MACT floor control levels, the Agency developed regulatory alternatives for the affected
subcategories. The first alternative developed was one that specified control levels at the floor for all new and
existing major sources. This alternative was designated Alternative IV. Next, various combinations of control
options were examined, ranging in stringency from the floor level controls specified in Alternative IV to the most
stringent controls for each subcategory. A cost-effectiveness analysis was then performed to eliminate the alternatives
with higher costs for the same or lesser emission reductions. A final set of three regulatory alternatives (Alternatives
IV, IV&hyph;Q, and IV&hyph;M) was then evaluated as the potential basis for the proposed standards. Alternatives
IV&hyph;Q and IV&hyph;M are similar to Alternative IV except, they contain increasingly stringent levels of equipment
leak control at existing facilities. The following paragraphs and Table 1 describe these alternatives.

At pipeline breakout stations, Alternative IV requires that secondary seals be installed on both new and existing
external floating roof storage tanks and that fixed-roof tanks be retrofitted with internal floating roofs with
primary seals. The control level for storage tanks is the same as 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. It also requires that an
LDAR program equivalent to 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV be implemented for equipment leaks at new facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At new and existing bulk gasoline terminals, Alternative IV specifies a 10 mg TOC/liter emission limit for vapor processors
at loading racks, and requires the same storage tank requirements discussed above for pipeline breakout stations.
Also, new facilities must use vacuum assist vapor collection for loading of gasoline tank trucks and railcars, and
an LDAR (40 CFR part 60, subpart VV) program. Also, at existing bulk gasoline terminals, Alternative IV requires tank
trucks and railcars to undergo an annual vapor tightness test. Under this alternative, no LDAR program is required
for equipment leaks at existing bulk gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives IV&hyph;Q and IV&hyph;M specify controls identical to those of Alternative IV, with the addition of
a pollution prevention LDAR program for both pumps and valves at existing bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout
stations. Alternative IV&hyph;Q adds a quarterly LDAR program for pumps and valves at existing facilities, and Alternative
IV&hyph;M adds a monthly LDAR program for pumps and valves at these same sources. LDAR programs at existing sources
achieve emission reduction at little additional annual cost to each facility, and are in use at facilities with similar
equipment.

During the development of today's proposal, EPA considered including an emissions averaging approach but did not
identify any viable alternatives. EPA would be interested in pursuing the development of an averaging alternative
if such an alternative would be protective of the environment and, as expected, lower the cost of achieving any particular
emission reduction. A possible benefit of an averaging approach is that it may provide sources greater flexibility
in achieving emissions reductions that may also translate into cost savings for the source. EPA is interested and
requests data and comments that could be used to develop an emissions averaging alternative in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For the entire gasoline distribution network, total nationwide HAP emissions are estimated to be 52,440 Mg/yr at
baseline. Of these emissions, approximately 23,750 Mg/yr (45 percent of the total) can be attributed to the two subcategories
of the network subject to today's proposed regulation; nearly 7,250 Mg/yr of HAP's are emitted by pipeline breakout
stations, while about 16,500 Mg/yr are associated with bulk gasoline terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All individual sources of emissions at facilities in these two subcategories are significant contributors to total
facility emissions, with equipment leaks at pipeline breakout stations being the smallest (12 percent of the baseline
subcategory total, due to the relatively small number of equipment components in the process piping at these facilities).
Storage tanks at pipeline breakout stations contribute the remaining 88 percent of the total for this subcategory.
At bulk gasoline terminals, HAP emissions are more evenly distributed: loading racks account for 18 percent of the
baseline subcategory total, storage tanks contribute 33 percent, fugitive leaks from cargo tanks of trucks or railcars
account for 23 percent of the subcategory total, and it is estimated that leaking pumps and valves in the process line
piping account for the remaining 26 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that implementation of Alternative IV would reduce these HAP emissions from pipeline breakout stations
and bulk gasoline terminals by 11 percent, implementation of Alternative IV&hyph;Q would reduce them by a little
less than 13 percent, and Alternative IV&hyph;M by slightly more than 14 percent. All of these are significant amounts
in view of the fact that these reductions are incremental to existing programs, and that only an estimated 23 percent
of the total subcategory facilities are major sources. (The analysis estimates that 7.4 percent of pipeline breakout
stations and 27 percent of bulk gasoline terminals qualify as major sources.) If only major source pipeline breakout
stations and bulk gasoline terminals are considered at baseline, implementation of Alternative IV reduces these
emissions by 48 percent, Alternative IV&hyph;Q by 55 percent, and Alternative IV&hyph;M by 59 percent.

Data directly from bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline facilities was not available to analyze the equipment leak
potential emissions and reductions. The Agency used the emissions data that had been previously collected at petroleum
refineries, including the Agency's published AP&hyph;42 emission factors. Subsequent to the Agency's analysis,
new data specific to leaking components at bulk gasoline terminals was released in a published report. This data appeared
to indicate lower emissions than those derived from the refinery data, and industry commenters urged the Agency to
reconsider leak detection and repair standards for this subcategory. These commenters also stated that equipment
components in use at gasoline production and distribution facilities are quite different, so the assumption that
the leakage characteristics of components at these two types of facilities are similar may not be valid. To address
this latter comment first, the Agency believes that the magnitude and frequency of leaks from components at these
facilities are similar. This conclusion is based on several years of gathering and analyzing data on all configurations
and uses of equipment at refineries and chemical production facilities. The Agency, in these data gathering efforts,
found no correlation between temperature, pressure, or component size and the magnitude or frequency of leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency performed a thorough review of the new data collected at bulk gasoline terminals. It was determined that,
while acceptable test protocols were used, the quantity of data (which were for only a few terminals) were insufficient
to warrant a change in the emission calculations for these components. Therefore, the Agency's conclusion that a
periodic equipment monitoring program would be a cost-effective means of ensuring maximum HAP emission reductions
is unchanged. The data discussed above indicates potentially lower equipment leak emissions rates than those found
in testing refineries. It should be noted that any facilities where this may be the case, could qualify for the less
frequent monitoring requirements in today's proposed standards, as provided for in 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is open to receiving additional data that could be used to quantify emissions and control levels of leaking
equipment at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations. This includes leak frequency data, leak correlation
data, and information on programs that may be in place to reduce equipment leaks. Such data should include specifics
on test procedures, applicable rules, control methods, etc. The Agency will review all data received in developing
and assessing the final control requirements. The full range of control options presented here will be included in
the consideration.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Implementation of Alternative IV, IV&hyph;Q, or IV&hyph;M is estimated to result in identical capital costs, approximately
$125 million. This cost is primarily associated with retrofit or installation of vapor collection piping and vapor
processors for loading racks at bulk gasoline terminals. However, there is a difference in annualized cost among
these three alternatives due to annual costs and recovery credits associated with implementing LDAR programs at
existing sources. Recovery credits are calculated based on the value and the amount of gasoline not allowed to evaporate
or collected under each control alternative. Alternative IV&hyph;Q requires the smallest annualized cost, $15.8
million/yr, due to having the largest recovery credit per dollar spent on implementation of the program. Alternative
IV&hyph;M is slightly more costly at $16.3 million/yr (recovery credits per dollar spent are not quite as large as
IV&hyph;Q). Alternative IV has similar annualized cost as Alternative IV&hyph;M.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The implementation of either Regulatory Alternative IV, IV&hyph;Q, or IV&hyph;M is projected to result in gasoline
price and consumption impacts, facility closures, and declines in employment. The national average base year increase
in the retail price of motor gasoline as a result of these alternatives is estimated at $0.001 per gallon. The national
base year decline in gasoline consumption is estimated at less than 100 million gallons (0.08 percent). There are
a limited number of facility closures estimated to result from the regulatory alternatives. The base year facility
closure estimate is nearly 650, of which more than 90 percent are projected for the service station sector. While the
estimated number of service station closures is estimated to be in the hundreds, it should be noted that a total of over
380,000 stations are projected being in operation during the base year, so that the number of facilities closing would
constitute less than two-tenths of one percent. Furthermore, due to a consumption-spurred projection of modest
industry growth from 1993 to 1998, some closures due to the regulation may be more accurately interpreted as reductions
in new facility openings rather than closures of existing facilities. Employment reductions due to reduced consumption
and facility closure are estimated at just over 1,100 jobs, of which 70 percent are projected for the service station
sector. However, this job loss constitutes only about 0.05 percent of the total employment attributed to the service
station sector in the base year. For the same reason given for facility closures, some employment reductions may be
more accurately interpreted as reductions in industry job opportunities rather than losses of existing jobs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As discussed earlier, there is projected to be no adverse secondary air pollution or water pollution impacts associated
with standards based on implementation of any of the alternatives. In fact, there is likely to be some benefits. For
example, implementation of any of the alternatives would be based in major part on an LDAR program. LDAR programs at
most facilities should actually reduce the water pollution impact through detection and repair of faulty equipment
in a shorter timeframe than in the past. Additional benefits may be realized through decreased intrusion of rainwater
into storage tanks at both facility types. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small amount of water condensed from the air-vapor stream by refrigeration condenser systems installed at loading
racks should pose no threat to the environment because the gasoline is recovered (typically in an oil-water separator)
and the gasoline-water portion is collected and stored for processing off-site.

The only potential secondary impact involves solid waste disposal, which may result in cases where carbon adsorbers
are used to comply with the emission standards at bulk terminal loading racks. Spent activated carbon from these units
is normally reclaimed for reuse during the carbon's useful life, and then discarded when it is no longer effective
(usually 10 years) or reactivated in a furnace. If the average annual solid waste impact of this disposal (assuming
no reactivation) is spread over the estimated life of the carbon, an overall environmental impact of about 230 megagrams
per year (0.7 megagrams per terminal) results. Consequently, the magnitude of the adverse solid waste disposal impact
occurring from the implementation of any of these alternatives is considered small.

8. Consideration of Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There is a beneficial nationwide energy impact associated with implementation of each of the alternatives. Implementation
of LDAR programs and installation of secondary seals on storage tanks both result in energy savings, since additional
gasoline is kept in the tanks and lines, and remains available for sale rather than being allowed to escape to the atmosphere.
Only a small amount of electrical energy would be required for most flares that may be installed at bulk terminal loading
racks for emission control; however, assist gas may be necessary for some systems. Where thermal oxidation, refrigeration
condenser, or carbon adsorption systems are installed to achieve compliance for loading racks, however, a moderate
amount of electrical energy will be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned earlier, vapor recovery (noncombustion) systems would recover gasoline from vapors collected at bulk
terminal loading racks; LDAR programs, storage tank monitoring, and vacuum assist vapor collection all operate
to reduce evaporation and improve leak prevention, so they result in gasoline savings. Assuming that 25 percent of
the emission reduction at bulk terminal loading racks would be accomplished using recovery devices (the remainder
would be the result of combustion devices) and subtracting the energy used by the recovery devices from the energy
in the recovered product, the savings resulting from implementation of each of the alternatives are as follows: Alternative
IV results in recovery of approximately 16 million gallons of gasoline per year, Alternative IV&hyph;Q saves almost
18 million gallons per year, and Alternative IV&hyph;M recovers slightly more than 19 million gallons per year.

9. Selection of the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In accordance with Clean Air Act section 112(d), the Administrator is required to set emission standards for new and
existing sources of HAP's from source categories listed pursuant to section 112(c) [see the source category list
proposal of July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576)]. In doing so, the Administrator must require the maximum degree of reduction
in emissions of HAP's that is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving the emission reduction,
any nonair quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. Having given full consideration
to these directives, the Administrator has selected Alternative IV&hyph;Q as the basis for the proposed standards
for gasoline distribution major sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All three alternatives discussed earlier (IV, IV&hyph;Q, and IV&hyph;M) satisfy the Act's criteria. Alternative
IV achieves the least HAP emission reduction and is the least stringent possible alternative allowed by the Act statutory
language. However, the Act provides for setting standards above the floor. As a result, Alternatives IV&hyph;M and
IV&hyph;Q contain control levels more stringent than the floor for existing sources (monthly and quarterly leak
detection and repair of pumps and valves, respectively). Results of emission reduction calculations show that Alternative
IV&hyph;M achieves greater HAP emission reductions than IV&hyph;Q or the floor Alternative IV. Additionally, analysis
shows that Alternative IV&hyph;Q and IV&hyph;M would have minor economic and nonair quality environmental impacts,
and beneficial energy impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Alternative IV&hyph;M would achieve the maximum reduction in HAP emissions, there is uncertainty in the
calculation of emission reductions for leak detection and repair (as discussed in section 4). Due to this uncertainty
in emissions and the increased cost of Alternative IV&hyph;M, Alternative IV&hyph;Q was chosen over the more stringent
Alternative IV&hyph;M.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 112(h) of the Act requires that standards be promulgated in terms of a numerical emission standard except
when it is not feasible for the pollutants to be emitted through a conveyance or it is not practicable to apply measurement
methodology due to technological or economic limitations. In these cases, the Administrator may promulgate a design,
equipment, work practice, or operational standard that is consistent with the intent of section 112. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed under Section B above, there are four distinct categories of emission sources at bulk gasoline terminals:
(1) Displacement losses when gasoline tank trucks or railcars are loaded at loading racks, (2) fugitive vapor losses
from leaking tank trucks or railcars during controlled loading operations, (3) losses from storage tanks, and (4)
vapor leaks from equipment components. The latter two emission sources also occur at pipeline breakout stations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To set a numerical emission limit for tank truck loading operations, the total HAP emissions would have to be measurable,
so that a comparison with this emission limit could be made. Since the small portion of the displaced vapors which may
leak from the tank trucks cannot be quantitatively measured, accurate measurements of total HAP emissions from tank
truck loading are not possible. However, the major portion of the displaced vapors can be measured after the vapors
are collected at the loading rack. Vapor collection systems typically include the equipment at the loading rack used
to contain and route emissions, and generally consist of hoses or arms, manifolding, piping, and check valves. This
type of system is consistent with the current state-of-the-art collection systems in use at many existing bulk gasoline
terminals. Because of its demonstrated control effectiveness, and because it is not possible to set a standard of
performance for the total emissions from the loading operation, an equipment standard requiring a vapor collection
system at each loading rack was selected by the Administrator as the format for controlling HAP emissions at the loading
racks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since emissions from the vapor collection system can be measured, standards of performance in the form of a numerical
emission limit can be applied to emissions from the vapor collection system. Several formats for these standards
of performance are possible. Three formats considered for limiting emissions from the vapor collection system include
a concentration standard, a control efficiency standard, and a mass emissions standard. A vapor processing system
would be necessary under any of these formats to achieve the required emission limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A format expressed in terms of concentration would limit the HAP concentration in the exhaust from the vapor processing
system. However, test data from these systems indicate a variation in exhaust gas flow rates and concentrations among
the various types of systems. Separate concentration limits might be required for each type of control system at each
affected terminal if a concentration format were selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information from the manufacturers and test results indicate that the control efficiencies of the processing systems
are dependent on the inlet concentration to the processor. The data further indicate that concentrations at the inlet
of the processor vary considerably from terminal to terminal. It would be difficult to adjust the calculations to
account for these variations. Also, control efficiency testing would require two separate measurements of pollutant
concentration instead of just one measurement as required in the concentration or mass approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A mass standard based upon the vapor processor outlet emissions would involve a simpler, less expensive, and more
straightforward test procedure. This testing would require measurement of mass emissions at the processor outlet
only. In addition, the affected industry has over 15 years experience in conducting this type of testing at bulk gasoline
terminals and, in fact, this is the type of test data analyzed to determine the MACT control levels for the facilities
to be regulated in this source category. Due to these considerations, a mass emission format, based on measurements
at the outlet of the vapor processor only, was selected for the standard to be applied to bulk terminal tank truck and
railcar loading emissions. This mass emission format is the same type analyzed to determine the MACT control levels
for vapor processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test methods that have proved to be acceptable for measuring pollutant emissions from bulk terminal control systems
measure the total organic compounds content of the exhaust stream. To analyze the stream specifically for HAP content,
more complex testing would have to be carried out. The emission reduction processes utilized in vapor processing
systems have been found to reduce HAP's in proportion to the reduction of total organics. Therefore, the emission
limit for loading rack vapor collection systems is expressed in terms of mass (milligrams) of total organic compounds
emitted per volume (liter) of gasoline loaded into tank trucks and railcars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even at loading racks controlled through installation of vapor collection and processing systems, gasoline vapor
emissions may occur from the loading operation due to vapor leakage from closed gasoline tank trucks or railcars during
loading. These leakage emissions originate from pressure-vacuum vents and defective hatch covers and seals. Due
to the fugitive nature of these emissions, it is not feasible to collect the escaping vapors and route them through
a conveyance. Since cargo tank leakage measurements at the loading racks do not provide a quantitative measurement
of total organic concentration, flow rate, or mass emissions, an enclosure around a loading tank truck or railcar
would be necessary in to trap emissions for measurement. An enclosure or conveyance to accomplish this is not technologically
or economically practicable. Due to these considerations, the Administrator determined that a standard of performance,
in the form of a numerical emission limit, could not be set, and that a work practice standard would be appropriate for
controlling cargo tank vapor leakage emissions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One method for monitoring fugitive tank truck or railcar emissions would involve the use of a portable hydrocarbon
analyzer to detect emissions during loadings. However, such a requirement is considered to represent an excessive
burden, especially at unmanned terminals where entry is gained through a cardlock system. Another method for exercising
control over leaking tank trucks would consist of a work practice standard. The work practice standard format would
consist of a requirement that the owner or operator of the terminal restrict loadings of gasoline tank trucks to those
for which documentation was on file that the tank had passed an appropriate vapor tightness test within the last year.
This type of requirement is in effect in many areas of the country under current State rules and is the basis for setting
the MACT control level. Since it is the most practical and effective means of controlling tank truck or railcar fugitive
emissions at loading racks with vapor control systems, this work practice standard was selected by the Administrator
as the requirement for fugitive tank truck leakage control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions from gasoline storage tanks at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations consist of a combination
of standing and working losses. These emissions consist of vapors that escape through rim seals on the circumference
of the tank (internal and external floating roof tanks), and for fixed-roof tanks, through several vents and other
openings necessary to relieve built up internal tank pressures. The large number of emission points makes testing
these sources excessively expensive and burdensome. Based on the best industry practice in use for controlling these
emissions, an equipment and work practice standard is being proposed for the control of these storage tanks, which
is identical to the national standards in practice for new storage tanks, 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. For fixed-roof
tanks, an internal floating roof would be added, and for existing external floating roof tanks, a secondary seal would
have to be added for those tanks with only a primary seal on the floating roof. Periodic visual inspections and seal
gap measurements would be necessary to ensure that the seals are continuing to maintain the required control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations utilize pumps, valves, and other liquid and vapor transfer
equipment components that may develop leaks over time. Due to the large number of sources, testing each to quantify
emissions would be expensive. Thus, an equipment leak LDAR program and specific equipment standards similar to those
currently being practiced at petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing facilities, and a few terminals could
be used to identify leaking components so that timely repair could be carried out. It is proposed that monthly monitoring
of components and specific equipment standards at new facilities and quarterly monitoring of pumps seals and valves
only at existing facilities, with the described provisions to modify these frequencies on the basis of monitoring
results, be carried out.

The Administrator does not preclude selection of alternative means of compliance to those described above in part
D of this section, provided that the owner or operator provides proof of compliance as specified under section 112(h)(3)
of the Act. If, after notice and opportunity for comment, the owner or operator of any source establishes to the satisfaction
of the Administrator that an alternative means of emission limitation will reduce emissions of any air pollutant
at least as much as would be achieved under the design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination
thereof, the Administrator shall permit the use of the alternative means.

The proposed standards require several types of performance tests, as well as both periodic and continuous monitoring
to ensure that the intent of the standards to achieve maximum emission reductions is realized. The tests include performance
testing of the bulk terminal control system, vapor leak monitoring and repair of the vapor collection system before
each performance test, and annual vapor tightness testing of tank trucks and railcars that will load at the affected
terminals. All of these procedures have been used with acceptable results and are consistent with &sect;63.7 of the
proposed General Provisions for performance testing. Storage tanks at terminals and pipeline stations would require
periodic visual and seal gap measurement tests (consistent with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb). Equipment components
would have to be monitored and repaired as necessary in accordance with the applicable LDAR program (requirements
are detailed in 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Continuous monitoring of an operating parameter would be required for vapor processing systems. At new bulk gasoline
terminals, the vacuum achieved in the tank truck or railcar during vacuum assist loading would have to be monitored
continuously. These monitoring requirements are required to verify that the control systems continue to provide
the control level required by the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Emission Test Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Performance tests ensure that a vapor control system at a bulk gasoline terminal is in initial compliance with the
required control level, and they also establish operating conditions under which the system should continue to meet
the required standard. An initial performance test would be required, in accordance with the schedule in &sect;63.7
of the proposed General Provisions. This initial test is required 120 days after the effective date of the standards
or after initial startup for a new facility, or 120 days after the compliance date specified for an existing facility.
In accordance with &sect;63.7(a)(2) of the proposed General Provisions, the Administrator may require a performance
test at any other time it is authorized by section 114 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards require the use of approved test methods to ensure consistent and verifiable results for the
initial performance test and for demonstration of continuous compliance. Methods 2A, 2B, 25A, and 25B of 40 CFR part
60, appendix A are specified for measurement of total organic compound emissions from the vapor collection and processing
system. These methods have been used routinely for many years at bulk gasoline terminals. Due to the difficulties
involved in measuring mass emissions from flares without an outlet stack (which can be used to control loading rack
emissions), the above test methods will not be applicable. In these cases, flares must comply with &sect;63.11 of
the proposed General Provisions which includes a compliance determination according to Method 22 of 40 CFR Part 60,
Appendix A, and design specifications for exit velocity and heat content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before each performance test, the owner or operator would be required to monitor potential leak sources in the terminal's
vapor collection and processing system during the loading of a gasoline tank truck or railcar. Leaks (defined as a
meter reading of 500 ppm or greater calibrated with methane) would have to be repaired before conducting the performance
test. This leak definition is consistent with the definition in other equipment leak monitoring regulations; i.e.,
40 CFR part 60, subparts VV and GGG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards would require each gasoline tank truck and railcar loaded at an affected bulk terminal to be
certified as vapor-tight through an annual vapor tightness test according to Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix
A. This test verifies that the tank compartments will not emit fugitive vapors or admit fresh air into the tank truck
during loading. The pressure-vacuum test of Method 27 is presently required annually for gasoline tank trucks operating
at terminals subject to the bulk gasoline terminals NSPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Continuous Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In addition to the initial performance test required for bulk terminal vapor processing systems, continuous monitoring
of the operation of these systems is also part of the proposed standards. Selection of the format for this monitoring
and the rationale for the selection are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous monitoring systems that monitor vapor processor exhaust organic emissions in the units of the proposed
standard (mg/liter) would require measuring not only total organics concentration in the system exhaust, but also
exhaust gas flow rate, volume of product dispensed, temperature, and pressure. Such systems are not currently in
use at bulk gasoline terminals. However, monitoring equipment is available and in use for monitoring the operational
variables associated with the operation of the processing systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed standards (40 CFR part 63, subpart R) require continuous monitoring of operating parameters of
vapor processing systems, and reports of periods when the monitored value exceeds or there is a failure to maintain,
as appropriate, the parameter value established by monitoring data recorded during the performance test. The Agency
is requiring each source to establish a site-specific monitoring parameter value and if exceeded or not maintained,
as appropriate, it would be an enforceable violation of the emission limit. System-specific values for monitored
parameters would account for deviations in the design, installation, and operational characteristics of individual
control systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under the NSPS and the earlier NESHAP programs, parameter monitoring has traditionally been used as a tool in determining
whether control devices are being maintained and operated properly. However, section 114(a)(3) of the Act and &sect;70.6(c)
of the operating permit rule (57 FR 32251, July 21, 1992) require the submission of ``compliance certifications''
from sources subject to the operating permit program. Sources must certify whether compliance was continuous or
intermittent, as well as their compliance status at the end of the reporting period. In light of these requirements,
the Agency has considered how sources subject to this rule would demonstrate compliance. The Agency has found that
operating parameter monitoring is already being used successfully at some bulk gasoline terminals and can be applied
for this purpose. The Agency considers that each exceedence or failure to maintain, as appropriate, of a operating
parameter value would constitute a violation of the emission limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic compounds concentration at the processor outlet is the best indication of system operation and corresponding
emission reduction. A monitor to measure this parameter would be appropriate for carbon adsorption and possibly
refrigeration condenser systems. To achieve representative organic concentration measurements at the processor
outlet, the concentration monitoring device should be installed in the exhaust vent of the vapor processor: (1) At
least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or
other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur and (2) at least a half equivalent
diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For some vapor processing systems, monitoring of the exhaust organics concentration may be impracticable and monitoring
a process parameter may be an equally accurate measure of system performance. For example, temperature monitoring
of the combustion section of a thermal oxidation system or the temperature of the air-vapor mixture on the outlet side
of a refrigeration condenser system establish performance of the system. If a flare is used to control loading rack
emissions, a heat-sensing device such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or a thermocouple to indicate the presence of
a flame during the loading operation is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is requesting comment, including data and other supporting technical information, on whether the proposed
approach on continuous monitoring and types of monitoring parameters ensure continuous compliance of vapor control
systems that would be installed at affected bulk gasoline terminals to meet today's proposed emission standard.
Additionally, comments and data are requested on how representative the control equipment parameters are of actual
performance of the control equipment and in determining compliance. Also, comments and data are requested on alternative
methods to those proposed today that can be used to ensure continuous compliance with the emission standard. The proposed
regulation also allows for substituting an alternative vapor processing system for those mentioned above or the
monitoring of some other parameter if it can be demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction that the processing
system achieves the emission limit, and the value of the alternative monitoring parameter ensures continuous compliance
with the emission standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operating parameter value would be established during the initial performance test. During the test, the operating
parameter would be continuously recorded during all the times a gasoline tank truck or railcar was being loaded. Only
monitoring data from performance tests in which the system shows compliance with the 10 mg TOC/liter emission limit
are valid for the determination of the monitored operating parameter value. The operating parameter value would
be the average of the values recorded during which loadings of gasoline tank trucks occur over the six-hour performance
test. Today's proposal requires facilities to monitor this operating parameter value continuously, calculate
and record a rolling six-hour average valve, and report exceedences or failures to maintain, as appropriate, the
average value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New bulk gasoline terminals must install a vacuum assist vapor collection system to ensure that loading tank trucks
and railcars do not emit fugitive HAP vapors. The vapor collection system must be continuously monitored to verify
that a vacuum always exists in the system while loading is taking place. The monitoring location must be within 0.3
meter (1 foot) of the tank truck/vapor return line interface. The Agency is not proposing any specific vacuum levels
that must be maintained (although the vacuum must never exceed the level at which the system's or transport tank's
safety vents automatically begin to open). Therefore, the monitoring device need not be highly precise. However,
a continuous record indicating that a vacuum is being maintained for the duration of all loadings must be created and
maintained at the facility.

The proposed standards would require owners or operators who are subject to today's proposed standards under 40 CFR
part 63, subpart R to submit an Initial Notification. This report notifies the agency of applicability for existing
facilities or of construction for new facilities as outlined in &sect;63.5 of the proposed General Provisions, whichever
is applicable. A respondent must also report any facility modifications as defined in &sect;63.5 of the proposed
General Provisions. This report will establish an early dialogue between the source and the regulatory agency, allowing
both to plan for compliance activities. The notice is due within 45 days after the date of promulgation for existing
sources. For new sources, it is due 180 days before commencement of construction or reconstruction, or 45 days after
promulgation of today's proposed rules, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Initial Notification must include a statement as to whether the source can achieve compliance by the specified

or operator to discuss the problem with the regulatory authority as early as possible. This report will also include
a description of the parameter monitoring system intended to be used in conjunction with the vapor processing system.
Pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act, the proposed standards contain provisions for a 1-year compliance extension

The Notification of Compliance Status (NCS) would be submitted no later than 30 days after the facility's initial
performance test. It contains the information necessary to demonstrate that compliance has been achieved, such
as the results of the initial performance test on the vapor processing system and results of the LDAR monitoring program.
The submission of the performance test report will allow the regulatory authority to verify that the source has followed
the correct sampling and analytical procedures, and has performed all calculations correctly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in the performance test report submitted with the NCS would be the calculation of the operating parameter
value for the selected operating parameter to be monitored in the vapor processing system. The notification must
include the data and rationale to support this parameter value as ensuring continuous compliance with the emission
limit.

3. Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic Reports are required to ensure that the standards continue to be met and that vapor control systems are operated
and maintained properly. Generally, periodic reports would be submitted semiannually or quarterly. However, if
monitoring results show that the parameter values for the vapor processing system exceed or fail to maintain, as appropriate,
the operating parameter value for more than 1 percent of the operating time in a quarterly reporting period, or the
monitor is out of service for more than 5 percent of the time, the Administrator may request that the owner or operator
submit more frequent reports. After 1 year, the facility may return to quarterly reporting if approved by the regulatory
authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has established this reporting system to provide an incentive (less frequent reporting) for good performance.
Due to uncertainty about the periods of time over which sources are likely to experience exceedences or failures to
maintain, as appropriate, the operating parameter value or monitoring system failures, the Agency is seeking comment
on the 1 percent and 5 percent criteria triggering the potential for more frequent reporting. In particular, data
are requested on both the frequency of exceedences and monitoring system downtime. As discussed in section VI.F.2,
records must be kept of the parameter value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners and operators are also required to keep records of monthly or quarterly leak detection and repair, and to furnish
reports on program results, as specified in &sect;63.428(f). These reports can be made a part of the Periodic Report,
unless the frequency of the reports exceeds that of the Periodic Report. Facilities must also retain records and submit
reports of annual inspections of storage vessels, in accordance with &sect;63.428(e). These reports may also be
included in the appropriate Periodic Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Other Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There are also a limited number of other reports required under the proposed standards. Where possible, subpart R
is structured to allow information to be reported in the semiannual (or quarterly) Periodic Report. However, in a
few cases, it is necessary for the facility to provide information to the regulatory authority shortly before or after
a specific event. For example, notification before a performance test or a storage vessel inspection is required
to allow the regulatory authority the opportunity to have an observer present (as specified in the proposed General
Provisions). This type of reporting must be done separately from the Periodic Reports because some situations require
a shorter term response from the reviewing authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reports of start of construction, anticipated and actual startup dates, and modifications, as required under &sect;63.5
and &sect;63.9 of the proposed General Provisions, are entered into the Agency's Aerometric Information Retrieval
System (AIRS) and are used to determine whether emission limits are being met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records required under the proposed standards are generally required to be kept for 5 years. General recordkeeping
requirements are contained in the proposed General Provisions under &sect;63.10(b). These requirements include
records of malfunctions and maintenance performed on the vapor processing system and the parameter monitoring system.
At bulk gasoline terminals, vapor tightness (annual test) documentation for each gasoline tank truck and railcar
using the terminal is required. Continuous monitoring data from the parameter monitor on the vapor processor and
the pressure monitor on the vacuum assist vapor collection system will provide a record of continuous compliance
with the emission standards. Records of storage vessel inspections, operating plans, and other details of controlled
storage vessels at terminals and pipeline stations are to be kept as specified under &sect;60.115b. Records documenting
the LDAR program at subject facilities must be kept in accordance with &sect;60.486 (b) through (j).

H. Selection of Compliance Deadlines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Agency proposes to allow affected sources the following time periods after promulgation for compliance, as provided
for in Clean Air Act section 112(i). All sources, whether uncontrolled or having in place control systems or measures
requiring upgrading to meet the new standards, would be required to reach full compliance within 3 years after promulgation
of the standards. All sources must implement an LDAR program as soon as practical, but not later than 180 days after
promulgation of this rule. These compliance deadlines allow a reasonable time for replacement of operating equipment
at existing sources, for construction and installation of vapor control devices and piping, and for retrofit of storage
tanks.

I. Solicitation of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Administrator welcomes comments from interested persons on any aspect of the proposed standards, and on any statement
in the preamble or the referenced supporting documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards were developed on the basis of information available. The Administrator is specifically
requesting factual information that may support either the approach taken in the proposed standards or an alternate
approach. To receive proper consideration, documentation or data should be provided.

C. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined to treat this action as a ``significant regulatory
action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made
in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the docket listed at the beginning of today's
notice under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.

D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the OMB under the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared
by the Agency (ICR No. 1659.01) and a copy may be obtained from Ms. Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., (2136), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 400 hours per respondent for
the first year after the date of promulgation of the rule, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
The cost for this additional burden per respondent is estimated to be about 14,000 dollars during the first year.

E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations
on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared. However,
regulatory alternatives that would alleviate the potential impact of the proposed standards on directly affected
companies were not selected because the CAA requires all facilities that are members of a category or subcategory
of major sources to meet, at a minimum, the requirements of the MACT floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the affected industry sectors, the Small Business Administration's definition of small business is independently
owned companies with less than 100 employees. The proposed standards directly impact small companies owning gasoline
bulk terminals and pipeline breakout stations. Due to downstream wholesale gasoline price increases, the proposed
standards would indirectly impact small companies owning gasoline bulk plants and gasoline service stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A definitive estimate of the number of small businesses that would be directly and indirectly affected by the proposed
standards could not be feasibly obtained because of the lack of data related to the extent of vertical integration
in the gasoline distribution chain. However, the EPA believes that a maximum of 56 percent of all gasoline bulk terminals
are owned by small companies. Potentially, up to 99 percent of the indirectly affected gasoline bulk plants and service
stations are owned by small companies. The percentage of actual small companies in these sectors, especially the
gasoline bulk terminal sector, is projected to be much smaller due to vertical integration with petroleum refiners.
No estimate has been made of the percentage of pipeline breakout stations owned by small companies, but since they
are typically affiliated with petroleum refiners, the percentage is projected to be small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A preliminary assessment indicates that the proposed regulations would not result in financial impacts that would
significantly or differentially stress affected small companies. The compliance costs for all but the smallest
throughput facilities in directly affected industry segments are a minute fraction of production costs and revenues.
Even so, the per unit compliance cost differential between large throughput and small throughput facilities are
minor. Small facilities are likely to be serving small or specialized markets, which makes it unlikely that the differential
in unit control costs between large throughput and small throughput facilities will seriously affect the competitive
position of small companies, even assuming that small companies own small facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have
a significant impact on small companies, even though a substantial number of small companies may be affected.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is proposing to revise and reorganize its regulations on Smoking/No Smoking
Areas. As revised, designated smoking areas at the Bureau's medical referral centers and minimum security institutions
ordinarily would be outside of buildings and away from entrances. Wardens at all low, medium, high, and administrative
institutions other than medical referral centers may continue, but are not required, to designate indoor smoking
areas in addition to outdoor smoking areas. This amendment is intended to provide for a clean air environment and to
protect the health and safety of staff and inmates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on Smoking/No Smoking Areas. A final rule on this subject
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 16, 1989 (54 FR 47753). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Prisons is committed to the creation of a clean air environment and to protect the health and safety of
its staff and inmates by restricting areas in which a person is allowed to smoke. To achieve this purpose, the Bureau
is proposing that ``smoking areas'' to be designated by Wardens at medical referral centers and at minimum security
institutions shall ordinarily be outside of all buildings and away from all entrances so as not to expose others to
second-hand smoke. Because inmates at minimum security institutions have ample access to designated outdoor smoking
areas, the Bureau believes that the proposed change is a reasonable step towards a smoke free environment. Establishment
of a smoke free environment at the Bureau's medical referral centers is proposed in accordance with guidelines from
the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. As for the remaining Bureau institutions, the
proposed rule specifies that the Warden may, but is not required to, designate indoor smoking areas in addition to
outdoor smoking areas. The Bureau believes that by allowing Wardens at these institutions this discretion, the Bureau
will be able to more effectively assess the practicability of making further changes at higher security level institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the revisions described above, the Bureau has reorganized and revised its regulations on Smoking/No
Smoking Areas for the sake of clarity and to avoid redundancy. For example, the current regulations contain cross
references qualifying those locations where smoking ordinarily is not permitted. Because the Warden is responsible
for designating smoking areas, ordinarily only where the needs of effective operations so require, the Bureau deems
it unnecessary to list in its revised regulations specific locations which would still be subject to the Warden's
discretion. The listing of these locations has therefore been removed from the regulation, but remains as guidance
in implementing instructions to staff. The revised regulations also contain a nomenclature change in which the title
``Warden'' has been substituted for ``Chief Executive Officer''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
