<SUMMARY>

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise the regulations governing inspection and certification for fresh fruits, vegetables
and other products by revising the fees charged for the inspection of these products at destination markets and by
clarifying other charge-related regulations. The proposed fee increases are needed to offset the costs of developing
and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables and to recover the costs of providing Federal
fruit and vegetable inspection service at destination markets. Regulations regarding fees for inspection of small
lots (fifty packages or less) would be added to provide a fee commensurate with the level of effort typically required
to conduct such inspections. Finally, regulations regarding charges for waiting time would be added and conditions
governing the applicability of dock-side inspection fees would be clarified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), the Administrator
of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determined that this action would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule for the revision of the Regulations governing
inspection, certification and standards for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products will not impose substantial
direct economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small entities, and will not alter the market
share or competitive position of these entities relative to large businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations were last revised in November 1992. The proposed rule reflects fees needed to offset the cost of developing
and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables previously funded through an appropriation
and to recover the costs of Federal fruit and vegetable inspection service at destination markets rendered in accordance
with the AMA of 1946. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1994, Congress directed AMS to establish a user fee program,
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, to recover the cost of developing, reviewing, and maintaining agricultural commodity
standards that describe product quality attributes. This proposal would amend the schedule for fees and charges
for services rendered to users at destination markets to recover the portion of the cost for fresh fruit and vegetable
standardization that is applicable to these users.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA authorizes voluntary official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of fresh fruits,
vegetables, and other products such as raw nuts, Christmas trees, and flowers. The AMA provides that reasonable fees
be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered.
The program seeks to maintain an unobligated balance that is at least equal to 4 months of operating expense. The unobligated
balance for the Federal inspection service at destination markets at the end of fiscal year 1993 was 1.1 months of operating
expense. Approximately $240,000 in increases are expected in the cost the service pays for General Services Administration
office rent and Federal Telecommunications Service, and a $120,000 increase is expected for the cost of implementing
a locality-based pay system in January 1994. The service plans to implement cost-cutting actions during fiscal year
1994 that are expected to save approximately $350,000 each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 1995. These cost-cutting
actions will offset some of the expected increases in service costs; however, further action is necessary to meet
all rising costs and for the program's unobligated balance to grow to the 4 month level necessary to provide contingency
funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMS regularly reviews this program to determine if fees are adequate. The last fee change was effective on November
12, 1992 (57 FR 48929). With the planned cost-cutting actions, but without a fee increase, the unobligated balance
of this program is expected to decrease to seven-tenths of a month by the end of fiscal year 1994 and to two-tenths of
a month by the end of fiscal year 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the program's need to offset various rising expenses, to increase its unobligated balance, and to incorporate
user-fee funding for standardization activities, AMS proposes to increase the fees for destination market inspection
services. Additionally, regulations would be added or clarified to (1) establish a new inspection fee for 50 packages
or less of the same product; (2) reflect the lower level of effort typically required to inspect small lots compared
to that required for half carlot equivalent lots with 500 to 1,000 packages; (3) charge for waiting time at the prevailing
hourly rate when an inspection is delayed because product is not available or readily accessible; and (4) apply dock-side
inspection fees to cases where the applicant offers the product to AMS for inspection at the dock-side facility but
AMS chooses to inspect the product at another location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table compares current fees and charges with proposed fees and charges for fresh fruit and vegetable
inspection as found in 7 CFR 51.38. Unless otherwise provided for by regulation or written agreement between the applicant
and the Administrator, the charges in the schedule of fees as found in &sect;51.38 are:

(3) When weight certification is provided in addition to quality and/or condition inspection, a one-hour charge
shall be added to the carlot fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When inspections are performed to certify product compliance for Defense Personnel Support Centers, the daily
or weekly charge shall be determined by multiplying the total hours consumed to conduct inspections by the hourly
rate. The daily or weekly charge shall be prorated among applicants by multiplying the daily or weekly charge by the
percentage of product passed and/or failed for each applicant during that day or week. Waiting time and overtime charges
shall be charged directly to the applicant responsible for their incurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When performing inspections at the request of the applicant during periods which are outside the grader's regularly
scheduled work week, a charge for overtime or holiday work shall be made at the rate of $18.50 per hour or portion thereof
in addition to the carlot equivalent fee, package charge, or hourly charge specified in this subpart. Overtime or
holiday charges for time shall be rounded to the nearest half hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an inspection is delayed because product is not available or readily accessible, a charge for waiting time
shall be made at the prevailing hourly rate in addition to the carlot equivalent fee, package charge, or hourly charge
specified in this subpart. Waiting time shall be rounded to the nearest half hour.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document invites written comments on a proposal to either terminate or for 1994 suspend the seasonal incentive
plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New Jersey Federal milk orders. This was requested by
cooperative associations that represent about one-half of the milk supply for each market. The cooperatives contend
that the payment plans, which have been suspended since 1991, are no longer effective in altering producer seasonal
milk production patterns.

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that the proposed actions
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such actions would lessen
the regulatory impact of the order on dairy farmers and would have no impact on regulated handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the termination,
or as an alternative the suspension for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994, of the
following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing
areas are being considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. In &sect;1001.62, paragraphs (c) and (d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In &sect;1002.61, paragraphs (d) and (e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons who want to send written data, views, or arguments about the proposed termination or suspension of provisions
should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building,
P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, not later than 30 days after the publication of this notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The period for filing comments is limited to 15 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested termination or suspension is to be effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments that are received will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business
hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed actions would either terminate, or as an alternative suspend for the months of March through June 1994
and August through November 1994, the seasonal incentive plans for paying producers under the New England and New
York-New Jersey Federal milk orders. The seasonal payment plans provide for making deductions from prices paid to
producers during the normal flush-production months of March through June. The deducted amounts are returned to
producers during the normal short-production months of August through November. The plan is intended to provide
an incentive for dairy farmers to level out the seasonal milk production pattern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions were requested by several cooperative associations representing dairy farmers who supply handlers
regulated by the Federal milk marketing orders for the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing areas. Collectively,
these cooperatives represent about 51 percent of the producers associated with the New England marketing area and
about 48 percent of the producers associated with the New York-New Jersey marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cooperatives maintain that the ``Louisville'' seasonal payment plans have not had the effect of reducing the
large seasonal spring-to-fall swings in milk production as was intended when they were first provided for in these
orders some 25 years ago. They maintain that the seasonality of milk production in the Northeast has not been reduced
significantly. The cooperatives assert that the seasonal payment plans are largely ineffective because of a general
lack of awareness about the plan in the dairy farming community. They also contend that the price differentials are
too low to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to modify their seasonal production patterns. The cooperatives
also expressed concern about the impact of reducing returns to producers during the spring months when producer milk
prices are already generally lower than during other times of the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The cooperatives seeking actions noted that the seasonal incentive payment plans have been repeatedly suspended
since 1991. They contend that the prior suspension actions are further evidence that the plans are no longer necessary
or effective. These past suspensions, according to the cooperatives, were supported by the need for dairy farmers
to have additional monies available during the spring months in which prices to producers declined precipitously.
The cooperatives expect that milk prices will decline in the spring of 1994, which will continue to put a cash flow pressure
on dairy farmers during a time of increased cash needs for spring planting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, comments are sought to determine whether the aforementioned provisions should be terminated or, in the
alternative, suspended for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994.

 A hearing held in February 1993 to consider proposals to adopt multiple component pricing for milk pooled under the
Southern Michigan marketing order is being reopened to consider modifications to the pricing plan recommended for
that order. Additional proposals would authorize the market administrator to adjust pool supply plant shipping
requirements to reflect changes in marketing conditions. The reopened hearing will also consider a proposal to ``lock
in'' to regulation under the Southern Michigan order a UHT packaging plant that otherwise may be regulated under a
different Federal order each month. A request to consider the ``lock in'' proposal on an emergency basis also will
be considered.

Notice is hereby given of a reopened public hearing to be held at the request of most of the producers whose milk is pooled
under the Southern Michigan milk order. The reopened hearing will begin at 9 a.m. on March 1, 1994, at the Radisson Hotel,
11 Monroe Avenue NW., Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503, telephone (616) 242&hyph;6000, with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreement and to the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southern Michigan marketing
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreement and to the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence also will be taken to determine whether emergency marketing conditions exist that would warrant omission
of a recommended decision under the rules of practice and procedure (7 CFR 900.12(d)) with respect to Proposal No.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions under the Federal milk order program are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and informational requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties
may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary
a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order
is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler
is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition.
The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant,
or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition,
provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion
of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. This proposal would also require modification
of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints. This proposal is prompted by a structural review of Model
747 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent rapid decompression of the
airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe loads.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after tiny cracks in rivet holes in the upper fuselage
linked together, causing structural failure and explosive decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage.
This accident focused greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was attended by representatives of the
aviation industry from around the world. It became obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel,
the relatively slow pace of new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older technology
airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on this aging fleet and maintaining
its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America committed
to identifying and implementing procedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transport category
airplanes. An Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, with representatives from the aircraft operators, manufacturers,
regulatory authorities, and other aviation representatives, was established in August 1988. The objective of the
Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to (1) select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in
the transport fleet, to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, (2) develop corrosion directed
inspections and prevention programs, and (3) review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program,
(4) review and update the Supplemental Structural Inspection Documents (SSID), and (5) assess repair quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group assigned to review the Boeing Model 747 series airplanes completed its work on Item (2) in July 1989
and developed a baseline program for controlling corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness
of the Boeing Model 747 fleet. This program is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;36022, ``Aging Airplane
Corrosion Prevention and Control Program_Model 747,'' dated July 1989. The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment
39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990), which requires implementation of a corrosion prevention and control
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group completed a portion of its work on Item (1), above. The Working Group's proposal is contained in Boeing
Document Number D6&hyph;35999, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.''
The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6490 (55 FR 8374, March 7, 1990), which requires the installation
of the structural modifications identified in the document, and AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8437
(58 FR 8695, February 17, 1993), which requires structural inspections of older airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional structural inspections are required by AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39&hyph;6653 (55 FR 28600, July 12, 1990), which references Boeing Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, dated December 21, 1989. (A correction of the rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 30, 1990 (55 FR 31027).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action being proposed herein follows from the ongoing activities of the Working Group relative to Item (1). The
Working Group has identified certain service difficulties that warrant mandatory inspections following mandatory
modification of these airplanes. The Working Group considers that these service difficulties can be controlled
safely by repetitively inspecting following modification of these airplanes, and that, because of the safety implications,
the inspections should be mandatory to assure that all operators perform them. Typically, the addressed unsafe conditions
have occurred infrequently on older airplanes, and the Working Group has a very high degree of confidence in the ability
of an inspection program to detect the damage before it impairs safety.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Working Group has reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993, and has recommended it to the FAA for mandating of the described inspections to
detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and necessary
repair. The SWG also recommends modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened
with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 or more total landings. The upper skin panel
in these particular lap joints has a doubler that is hot-bonded to the skin. The countersink depth of the rivet is greater
than the basic skin gage. While this is not a problem for a skin panel with the hot bond intact, disbonding will result
in a knife-edge condition in the skin layer. This condition causes these lap joints to be more susceptible to fatigue-related
cracking. The SWG also recommends accomplishment of repetitive inspections of these modified lap joints. Accomplishment
of these modifications and inspections will detect fatigue-related cracking and corrosion in a timely manner and
will ensure the structural integrity of the skin lap joints beyond the design life of the airplane. The FAA has concurred
with the Working Group's recommendations and has determined that AD action is warranted to mandate the inspections
and modifications to assure the continued airworthiness of the Model 747 fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, Revision 2, dated October 14,
1993, that describes procedures for inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin
lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin also describes procedures for ``full'' modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage
upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 total landings.
Such rivets are used in the lap joints at the following locations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Stringer 12, left and right, from station 520 to 1,000; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Stringer 19, left and right, from station 520 to 740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``full'' modification for deep countersink rivets at these locations consists of opening the lap joint between
circumferential splices, removing adhesive, repairing all cracks and corrosion, and reassembling the lap joint
with 9/32 inch protruding head rivets at all rivet locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections
to detect fatigue-related skin cracks of modified lap joints at the upper fastener row, and repair, if necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service bulletin also describes procedures for an ``optional'' (partial) modification for certain lap joint
areas that have an upper skin panel thickness of 0.090 inch or less and that do not have cracks or corrosion or an existing
structural repair on the lap joint. The ``optional'' (partial) modification consists of removing the upper row of
rivets at a corrosion-free lap joint, performing an HFEC open hole inspection to detect cracks in removed rivet locations,
and installing 1/4-inch protruding head rivets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin
lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require ``full'' modification
of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that
have accumulated 20,000 total landings. The inspections and ``full modification'' would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed AD would also require repetitive external HFEC inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks of
modified lap joints, and repair, if necessary. After such repair, additional repetitive external HFEC inspections
would be required. The HFEC inspections and repair would also be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed AD would also provide an ``optional'' (partial) modification for certain skin panels that have a thickness
that is within specified limits, and that do not have cracks or corrosion or an existing structural repair on the lap
joint. For those skin panels, this ``optional'' (partial) modification may be accomplished in lieu of the ``full''
modification. However, the ``optional'' (partial) modification may not be implemented at deep countersink fastener
locations. The ``optional'' (partial) modification would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishment of the requirements of this proposed AD would terminate the requirements of AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06,
Amendment 39&hyph;6653 (55 FR 28600, July 12, 1990). The FAA is considering further rulemaking action to revise AD
90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39&hyph;6653, accordingly once this proposed AD becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 116 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the proposed inspections entail 100 work hours per airplane per inspection, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.)
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed inspections,
is estimated to be $638,000, or $5,500 per airplane per inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the proposed ``full'' modification entail approximately 96 work hours, for each 200-inch
length of uncracked and uncorroded lap joint, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include
the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) There are 100 lap joint sections per airplane, each with a length
of 200 inches. The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed ``full'' modification requirement, is estimated
to be $61,248,000, or $528,000 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the proposed initial HFEC inspection following modification entails approximately 56
work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed initial HFEC inspection following modification, is estimated to
be $357,280, or $3,080 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is expected to be
$62,243,280, or $536,580 per airplane. This total cost figure includes the proposed inspections and modification,
for the first year of the average five-year inspection cycle. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet
accomplished the proposed requirements of this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed ``full'' modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish.
However, the proposed compliance time specified in paragraph (e) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for accomplishment
of the ``full'' modification coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities,
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have applied to certain British Aerospace
(BAe), Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes. The proposed action
would have required identifying all Type ``F'' universal joints on the flap torque shaft and replacing these universal
joints with Type ``M'' or Type ``MC'' universal joints. Since issuance of the NPRM, Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. has introduced
improved flap torque shaft assemblies that include universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporate
the actions proposed in the referenced NPRM and required in two other existing airworthiness directives (AD's).
The FAA has determined that installing these improved assemblies would incorporate the actions of the current NPRM
and the requirements of the two existing AD's. The FAA is withdrawing the current NPRM and will subsequently issue
another NPRM that would incorporate all the actions referenced above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Jetstream Aircraft Ltd. has introduced improved flap
torque shaft assemblies that include universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporate the actions
proposed in the referenced NPRM and required in two other existing AD's. The FAA has determined that installing these
improved assemblies would incorporate the actions proposed in the current NPRM and the requirements of the following
AD's:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;5529, which requires limiting the in-service life of the torque
tube shaft assembly on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;6273, which requires repetitively inspecting the universal
joints and universal joint rivets on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and replacing
any damaged part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will issue another NPRM to propose combining the universal joint inspection requirements and the flap torque
shaft assembly life limit requirement of the two existing AD's, but mandate installing improved flap torque shaft
assemblies as terminating action for these requirements. Since this future action will also incorporate the previously
proposed actions, the FAA is withdrawing the existing NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this NPRM constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice
in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws an NPRM, it is neither a proposed rule nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered
under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Piper Aircraft Corporation
(Piper) PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes. The proposed action would require installing a certain nose landing
gear modification kit. Several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on the affected airplanes prompted
this action. In particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4&hyph;20) connecting the lower drag link
of the nosegear to the upper drag link. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent nose gear collapse
because of AN4&hyph;20 bolt failure, which could lead to airplane damage.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has received several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on certain Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and
PA44 series airplanes. In particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4&hyph;20) connecting the lower
drag link of the nosegear to the upper drag link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the nose landing gear of a Piper Model PA44&hyph;180 airplane collapsed during the landing roll. The
accident occurred during a normal touchdown and was a result of AN4&hyph;20 bolt failure. Both the left and right propellers
struck the ground and were damaged beyond repair.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Piper Service Letter No. 988, dated July 29, 1986, references Nose Landing Gear Modification Kit, Piper part number
(P/N) 764&hyph;377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) and Piper P/N 764&hyph;378 (for PA44 series airplanes).
The modification kits consist of a close tolerance bolt (NAS464P4&hyph;27), four bearings, and all other associated
hardware for installation on the draglink assembly. This NAS464P4&hyph;27 bolt replaces the AN4&hyph;20 bolt used
to connect the upper and lower draglinks. Instructions to these kits specify complete installation procedures for
these parts, including a check of the nosegear downlock hook to ensure that it rotates freely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the accident and incidents
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent nose gear collapse because of failure
of the AN4&hyph;20 bolt, which could lead to airplane damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44
series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing Nose Landing Gear Modification
Kit, Piper part number (P/N) 764&hyph;377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) or Piper P/N 764&hyph;378 (for
PA44 series airplanes). The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions included
with the referenced kits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 6,888 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 6 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $52 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,631,216. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected
airplane owners/operators have accomplished the proposed modification.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 5, 1993, the Coast Guard published an NPRM regarding the establishment of a vessel identification system
(VIS) (58 FR 51920). The VIS proposal would establish a vessel identification system, as required by legislation,
guidelines for State vessel titling systems, procedures for certifying compliance with those guidelines, and rules
for participation in the VIS system for undocumented vessels. The Coast Guard has received a request to extend the
comment period for six months. The Coast Guard has determined that in order to keep this important project moving in
as timely a manner as possible, extending the comment period for six months would be inappropriate. However, the Coast
Guard recognizes the value of data and information from interested parties. Therefore, the Coast Guard, in order
to encourage meaningful participation by all interested parties, is reopening the comment period for an additional
30 days.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its loan guaranty regulations to comply with certain
provisions of the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992 and the Onmibus Budget Reconciliatory Act of 1993.
VA proposes to amend its regulations to provide for the guarantee of loans for reservists and members of the national
guard, loans where the interest rate has been negotiated between the borrower and the lender, adjustable rate mortgages,
and energy efficient mortgages. VA also proposes to amend its regulations to reflect a reduced funding fee for interest
rate reduction refinancing loans, and a revised guaranty percentage for these loans as well as an increased funding
fee on most guaranteed loans, and an increased funding fee for second and subsequent use of the loan guaranty benefit,
except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans. These changes will increase the types of loans available to
veterans and the categories of veterans eligible for VA home loans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 VA is proposing to incorporate into its regulations several changes to comply with certain provisions of Public Law
102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547 persons whose only military service consisted of active duty for
training and inactive duty training in the reserve components of the Armed Forces did not qualify for loan guaranty
benefits. Public Law 102&hyph;547 extends eligibility for VA-guaranteed home loans to certain members of the Selected
Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5). This eligibility expires 7 years from the date of enactment of the law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38 U.S.C. 3729 requires that a funding fee be collected from each veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan except for
veterans who receive compensation or from a surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability.
Public Law 102&hyph;547 requires that a higher funding fee be collected on loans to the newly eligible members of the
Selected Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5) than on loans to other veterans. Effective October 1, 1993, Public
Law 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, increased the funding fee by 0.75 percent on all VA
loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans, vendee loans, direct loans, manufactured home loans under
38 U.S.C. 3712, and loan assumptions. This new law also established an increased fee for second and subsequent use
of the loan guaranty benefit, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans. The increase in funding fees
established by Public Law 103&hyph;66 will expire on September 30, 1998. VA is proposing to amend 38 CFR 36.4312 to
add the funding fee structure for members of the Selected Reserves, and to provide for the higher funding fees required
by Public Law 103&hyph;66, as discussed in the following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;66 provides that on loans to veterans whose entitlement is not based on service in the Selected
Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(5)(1), the funding fee shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, the funding
fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the funding fee shall
be 1.5 percent of the loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the funding fee shall be 1.25 percent of the
total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For refinancing loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7),
the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For loans where the veteran uses entitlement for a second or subsequent time and does not make a downpayment, the
funding fee shall be 3.00 percent of the total loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;66 provides that on loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve
as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5) the funding fee shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, the funding
fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the funding fee shall
be 2.25 percent of the loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the
total loan amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For refinancing loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7),
the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For loans where the veteran uses entitlement for a second or subsequent time and does not make a downpayment, the
funding fee shall be 3.00 percent of the total loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547 the Secretary was required to set a maximum interest rate which a
veteran could pay when purchasing a home with a VA guaranteed loan, and the veteran was not permitted to pay discount
points on the loan. Public Law 102&hyph;547 authorizes the Secretary to elect either to require that VA-guaranteed
loans bear interest at rates not to exceed the maximum rates established by the Secretary or to allow such loans to bear
interest at rates agreed upon by the veteran and the lender. The law also authorizes the Secretary to change the election
from time to time, and provides that when the Secretary has elected to have interest rates negotiated between the veteran
and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points on the loan. Effective October 28, 1992, the Secretary
elected to have interest rates negotiated between the veteran and the lender. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4212 and
36.4311 to reflect these changes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;547 generally prohibits financing discount points when interest rates are negotiated between
the lender and veteran. However, Public Law 103&hyph;78, approved August 13, 1993, permits veterans to finance discount
points on interest rate reduction refinancing loans. Accordingly, the proposed &sect;&sect;36.4212(b) and 36.4311(b)
prohibit discount points from being financed, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C.
3710(a)(8), 3710(b)(7) and 3712(a)(1)(F). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547, VA was authorized to guarantee fixed rate mortgages only. Public Law
102&hyph;547 authorizes a demonstration project during fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 whereby VA will guarantee
loans with adjustable interest rates. The law provides that the interest rate adjustments on these loans shall: (1)
Correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on
which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources; (2) be made by adjusting the
monthly payment on an annual basis; (3) be limited, with respect to any single annual interest rate adjustment, to
a maximum increase or decrease of 1 percentage point; and (4) be limited, over the term of the mortgage, to a maximum
increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4311 to provide
for an adjustable rate mortgage with these adjustment provisions. The regulations will also provide that the first
interest rate adjustment may occur 12 to 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The VA guaranteed
adjustable rate mortgage with the above features will be similar to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) adjustable
rate mortgage. This should facilitate pooling of these mortgages together in Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA) mortgage-backed securities pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;547 requires the Secretary to carry out a program to demonstrate the feasibility of guaranteeing
mortgages for the acquisition of an existing dwelling and the cost of making energy efficiency improvements to the
dwelling or for energy efficient improvements to a dwelling owned and occupied by a veteran. The law authorizes an
addition to the purchase loan for the cost of energy efficient improvements. It provides that for a mortgage guaranteed
under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) the cost of the energy efficient improvements may be added to the loan amount provided the cost
does not exceed (1) $3,000; or (2) $6,000, if the increase in the monthly payment for principal and interest does not
exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs resulting from the energy efficiency improvements. VA proposes
to amend 38 CFR 36.4336 to provide that a loan for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) may
exceed the reasonable value of the property by the cost of the energy efficient improvements as stated above. This
demonstration program for financing the cost of energy efficiency improvements will expire on December 31, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The law provides that the amount of the guaranty for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d)
will be in the same proportion as would have been provided if the energy efficiency improvements were not added to the
loan amount. It also provides that there be no additional charge to the veteran's entitlement as a result of the increased
loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4302 to conform to these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;547 reduces the funding fee for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under
sections 3710(a)(8), 3710(a)(9)(B), and 3712(a)(1)(F) to 0.50 percent of the total loan amount. VA proposes to amend
38 CFR 36.4232, 36.4254 and 36.4312 to comply with the law. The law also provides that the guaranty amount for interest
rate reduction refinancing loans shall not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount or 25 percent of the
loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4223 and 36.4302 to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66 included in the appropriate regulations by
this amendment have been implemented administratively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendments will not, if promulgated, have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The proposed amendments simply update VA regulations to incorporate the changes which have
already been made by Public Law 102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66.

(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 the Secretary may elect to require that such loans
bear interest at a rate that is (1) agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or (2) established by the Secretary. The
Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this paragraph by publishing a notice in the

. Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average
yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at `constant
maturity' are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the
yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury
bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published
by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519)
is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the
Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.

Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur not sooner than
12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. To set the new interest rate,
the lender will determine the change between the initial (i.e., base) index figure and the current index figure. The
initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current
index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran.
The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain
spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Except for the initial
rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate
shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage
point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess
of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in
the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of
more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated
into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example,
if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent.
If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 81/8
percent.

may be increased by up to $10,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of
a home, purchase of a condominium, or for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan, and (ii) entitlement for manufactured

(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 the Secretary may elect to require that such loans
bear interest at a rate that is (1) agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or (2) established by the Secretary. The
Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this paragraph by publishing a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Provided, however, that the interest rate of loans for the purpose of an interest rate reduction (38 U.S.C. 3710 (a)(8)
or (b)(7)) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount
points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest
rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7). For loans bearing an interest rate agreed
upon by the veteran and the lender the provisions of &sect;36.4312, paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) do not apply.

Interest rate index.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average
yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at `constant
maturity' are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the
yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury
bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published
by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519)
is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the
Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.

 Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur no sooner than
12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. To set the new interest rate,
the lender will determine the change between the initial (i.e., base) index figure and the current index figure. The
initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current
index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran.
The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain
spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Except for the initial
rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate
shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage
point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess
of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in
the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of
more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated
into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example,
if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent.
If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 81/8

the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using
entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent. On purchase or construction loans
on which the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the amount of the funding fee

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 15, 1992, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for Fuels and Fuel Additives (F/FAs) Registration Regulations (57 FR 13168).
The purpose of the proposed regulation would be to establish requirements for the registration of motor vehicle F/FAs
as authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Under the proposed regulations, manufacturers
of F/FAs would be required to conduct certain tests and submit information regarding the composition of emissions
produced by such F/FAs and the effects of these emissions on public health and welfare.

EPA held a public hearing on the NPRM on May 28, 1992 and accepted written comments until June 30, 1992. Subsequent analysis
indicated that additional public notice to clarify and reconsider a few specific compliance-related and technical
issues would be helpful in developing the final rule. Today's action presents these issues and requests comments
on EPA's proposals for addressing them. The issues addressed in this document are the following: Timing of requirements
for new F/FAs, alternative testing requirements in lieu of Tier 2, general emission generation methodology, mileage
accumulation for the testing of atypical F/FAs, and base fuel specifications.

The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 USC
section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive for registration and prohibits manufacturers
of designated fuels or additives from selling such products unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance
with section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic registration requirements,
as stipulated by section 211(b)(1), that required applicants to submit certain information, such as commercial
identifying information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition, in order to register
a fuel or fuel additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA also gave EPA discretionary authority to establish additional registration requirements under section
211(b)(2). This section authorized EPA to require F/FA manufacturers ``to conduct tests to determine potential
public health effects of such fuel[s] or additive[s] (including but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic,
or mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions
and determine their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on the public health and welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require testing of F/FAs under section 211(b)(2) when the general
registration regulations were issued in 1975. However, in the CAA Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95&hyph;95, August
7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2) mandatory. On August 7,
1990, EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) (55 FR 32218) and, on April 15, 1992, published
an NPRM (57 FR 13168) proposing additional registration requirements under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the
CAA. The purpose of the rule would be to provide EPA with information for identifying and evaluating the potential
adverse health effects of motor vehicle F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of related regulatory actions
in the future as specified in section 211(c). The reader is referred to the NPRM and Public Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07
for detailed information on the proposed registration requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the proposal, a public hearing was held on May 28, 1992, followed by a written comment
period which closed on June 30, 1992. A transcript of the public hearing and the written comments are contained in the
docket.

After careful evaluation of the comments and additional technical analysis, EPA determined that additional public
notice to clarify certain key compliance issues and to modify certain proposed technical approaches would be beneficial.
The next sections of this notice discuss the issues in question and request relevant comments from the public. EPA
asks the public to focus their comments on the key areas discussed below. Comments on topics addressed in previous
notices and comment periods will be treated as late communication to which EPA is not required to respond. The issues
to be addressed are the following: (1) Timing of requirements for new F/FAs, (2) alternative testing requirements
in lieu of Tier 2, (3) general emission generation methodology, (4) mileage accumulation for the testing of atypical
F/FAs, and (5) base fuel specifications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The registration requirements proposed in the April 1992 NPRM were organized within a three-tiered health effects
evaluation structure. Under Tier 1, F/FA manufacturers would be required to perform a literature search on the health
and welfare effects of 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide exposure information. Tier 2 would include short-term
biological testing to screen for specific health effects endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals
to the whole emissions of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. After receipt and review of manufacturers' Tier 1 and Tier
2 submittals, EPA would determine, on a case-by-case basis, if additional testing were needed under Tier 3 to evaluate
the risk of a particular F/FA (or group of F/FAs) on human health or welfare. Tier 3 testing could include any emissions
analysis, health effects, welfare effects, and/or exposure testing or analysis deemed necessary by EPA for this
purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organization of the F/FA program's requirements into hierarchical tiers was proposed, in part, to ensure that
the rule would accommodate the goals of section 211(b) within the time restrictions of section 211(e). Section 211(e)
requires that, for F/FAs registered as of the date of promulgation of the final rule, the ``requisite information''
be submitted to EPA within three years of that date. On the other hand, manufacturers seeking to register F/FA products
after the date of promulgation would have to satisfy the testing requirements before registration would be granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA judged that compliance with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements should be achievable within the three-year time
limit for registered F/FAs; thus, these two tiers were proposed to be defined as the ``requisite information'' for
registration pursuant to its authority under CAA section 211(e). However, maintenance of such registration would
be conditional on subsequent satisfaction of any Tier 3 requirements which EPA might impose pursuant to its authority
under CAA section 211(b). For consistency, the same definition of ``requisite information'' and the same Tier 3 arrangements
were proposed to apply to both currently registered and new F/FAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to maintain these originally proposed provisions in the case of currently registered F/FA products.
Thus, for continued registration of such F/FAs, compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 must occur within three years of promulgation
of the final rule. As proposed in the NPRM, this registration would be conditional on subsequent satisfaction of any
Tier 3 requirements which might be prescribed by the Agency. This means that if Tier 3 testing were prescribed for a
fuel or fuel additive product registered as of the time of promulgation, the registration would be extended for that
time which EPA specifies as necessary for completion of the prescribed Tier 3 requirements. Only upon satisfactory
completion of these requirements would re-registration occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of products for which manufacturers seek registration after promulgation of this rule, EPA is re-examining
the appropriateness of the timing of these Tier 3 provisions. As discussed in the NPRM, EPA interprets section 211(b)
in conjunction with section 211(c), which gives EPA authority to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction
into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive if the Administrator finds that the emission
products of such fuel or fuel additive ``causes, or contributes, to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger the public health or welfare.'' In light of this responsibility, EPA believes that it should exercise
particular caution in registering new 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products that are significantly different from or have a usage pattern which is significantly different in scope
or character from currently registered 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products. The potential health risks associated with the use of new F/FAs could be higher, lower, or the same as
those of current F/FAs. Thus, before permitting the introduction of these products into the market, the Agency must
have reasonable certainty that the public health consequences will not be made worse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clarification is therefore needed concerning what constitutes a ``new'' 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA. EPA believes it is appropriate to distinguish between two types of unregistered products which a manufacturer
might seek to register after the promulgation of the final rule: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA products similar in composition and usage to those already allowed wide commercial distribution (e.g., registered
for general use by other manufacturers), and (2) F/FA products which differ significantly in composition and/or
usage from such current products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To formalize this distinction, EPA is proposing to make use of grouping system concepts and definitions previously
discussed in the April 1992 NPRM. Specifically, EPA proposes that a F/FA product not registered by its manufacturer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as of the date of promulgation of this rule be designated as ``registrable'' if it meets the program's criteria for
grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the same fuel family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Conversely, a F/FA product not registered by its manufacturer as of the date of promulgation would be designated
as ``new'' if it does not meet the program's criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive
in the same fuel family. In these definitions, the term ``currently'' refers to the date on which EPA receives the registration
application for the F/FA in question.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of these definitions, registration is product-specific. Thus, if a particular fuel or additive product
has not been registered by its manufacturer, then that manufacturer does not have the right to introduce, market,
and/or sell this product, even if a compositionally similar or identical product has been registered by another manufacturer.

A ``bulk additive,'' sometimes called a ``general use'' additive, was defined in the NPRM as a product added to fuel
at the refinery as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery, but before
the fuel is purchased for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. In contrast, an ``aftermarket additive,''
sometimes called a consumer additive, is an additive product marketed for introduction directly into the fuel system
of a motor vehicle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
``Fuel family'' refers to the primary categorization of F/FAs within the proposed grouping system. A fuel family
was defined in the NPRM as a set of F/FAs which share basic chemical and physical formulation characteristics and can
be used in the same engine or vehicle. Seven such fuel families were originally defined (unleaded gasoline, leaded
gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane), although EPA now intends to delete the leaded gasoline
family in view of the prohibition under CAA section 211(n) of on-road use of leaded fuel after December 31, 1995. In
the proposed definition of ``registrable,'' the restriction ``in the same fuel family'' means that the similarity
of an applicant F/FA to a bulk additive currently registered for use in another fuel family would not suffice to make
the applicant F/FA registrable. This restriction is consistent with the general principles of the grouping system,
which permits grouping of F/FAs only within defined fuel families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to these definitions, an unregistered F/FA which meets the criteria for grouping only with a currently
registered aftermarket additive (and not also with a currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) would not be
registrable. This does not preclude an unregistered aftermarket additive from being registrable (since aftermarket
additives can group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the registration status of currently registered
aftermarket additives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in unleaded gasoline
and conforming to the ``substantially similar'' criteria for unleaded gasoline (56 FR 5352) would be registrable,
since it would be able to group with currently registered baseline unleaded gasoline fuels and bulk additives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On the other hand, an unregistered chromium-containing additive intended for use in unleaded gasoline would be
considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable,'' because there are no currently registered chromium-containing
fuels or bulk additives in the unleaded gasoline family with which the applicant additive could be grouped. Even if
a chromium-containing product had previously been registered as an aftermarket additive for unleaded gasoline
(prior to the ban on such aftermarket additives under CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or as a bulk additive for use in another fuel family (e.g., leaded gasoline or diesel fuel), the applicant additive
would still be considered ``new''.

Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying
only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of
the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements other
than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA amendments,
all types of motor vehicle F/FAs were placed under section 211(f) jurisdiction. All aftermarket additives that were
not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990 were banned. However, this ban does
not apply to products first introduced into commerce prior to November 15, 1990 [CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)]. Thus,
``non-sub-sim'' gasoline aftermarket additives which had been registered prior to that date were allowed to retain
their registrations. These are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the original proposal, new F/FA products would automatically be allowed on the market after submission of Tier
1 and Tier 2 data, whether or not significant health effects concerns had arisen and whether or not EPA had sufficient
information to determine if action under section 211(c) were appropriate. However, to address the concerns described
above in relation to section 211(c), EPA is now proposing to require that manufacturers of new F/FA products (i.e.,
F/FA products not registered by their specific manufacturers as of the date of promulgation and not fitting the registrable
criteria) submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including Tier 3 when prescribed by the Agency.
This means that if EPA were to identify a need for additional testing at the Tier 3 level for a new F/FA, registration
would not be granted until satisfactory completion of all such requirements.

On the other hand, EPA is proposing to grant registration to ``registrable'' F/FAs upon the manufacturer's submittal
of the basic registration application and other pre-Tier 1 notification requirements (see NPRM)

. Once registered, these products would be legally able to enter the market. Furthermore, these products would have
the same testing and compliance requirements as those specified for currently registered products, i.e., three
years from the date of promulgation for the completion of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements and, if Tier 3 testing were
prescribed, additional time consistent with the incremental testing requirements. Manufacturers' compliance
with these requirements could be accomplished independently or as a member of an existing group.

Even if an unregistered F/FA were ``registrable'', however, EPA could invoke other available regulatory authority
under Federal law to prevent its commerical distribution if EPA were to determine that such action was necessary to
protect the public health or welfare. For example, applicable sections of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15
U.S.C. section 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
), such as the Significant New Use rule or the Premanufacturing Notification process, could be invoked to require
health effects testing prior to commerical distribution of an F/FA product if, among other factors specified in TSCA,
there is a change in the use of the product or an increase in the magnitude and/or duration of exposure to the product
by human beings or the environment (15 U.S.C. section 2601 (a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the proposed distinctions between registrable and new F/FAs, both in terms of their definitions
and their respective compliance requirements, reflect reasonable regard for the public health and welfare without
undue interference in the F/FA marketplace. Because registrable F/FAs are defined such that they must be reasonably
similar in composition and usage to current F/FAs, their entry onto the market would generally not be expected to increase
the health or welfare risks potentially related to current F/FA emission exposures. In determining whether a manufacturer's
product is registrable, the omission of aftermarket additives from the relevant population of currently registered
F/FAs is intended to prevent a potentially large increase in public exposure to generally untested products which
had previously been relatively limited in distribution and usage. It also ensures that the ability to group with a
``grandfathered'' aftermarket additive would not confer ``registrability'' on an unregistered F/FA. This is consistent
with the congressional intent in CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) to preclude introduction into commerce of new aftermarket
additives which do not fit the ``substantially similar'' criteria. The omission of F/FAs in different fuel families
from the relevant population of current F/FAs is also intended to prevent potential increases in exposure to untested
products. Expanding the use of an additive from one fuel family to another (e.g., from diesel fuel to gasoline) would
significantly increase the overall size of the potential market for the product and thus the potential exposure to
its emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these safeguards, EPA believes that additional protection to the public health would generally not be
achieved by prohibiting registrable F/FAs from entering the market while testing of these products (or groups of
similar products) proceeds. In the case of ``new'' F/FAs, however, EPA has no such assurances. By definition, these
F/FAs would be dissimilar in composition and/or usage to currently registered products, and allowing their introduction
could not reasonably be assumed to have no adverse effects on the health or welfare of the general population. For these
F/FAs, therefore, EPA believes that it must protect the public health and welfare by requiring compliance with all
data requests it deems necessary before exposing the public to potentially increased risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 1 summarizes the decision process for determining whether an unregistered F/FA product would be ``registrable''
(and thus handled much like a currently registered product), or whether an unregistered F/FA product would not be
``registrable'' and must complete all testing requirements before registration is granted.

As a result of these modifications to the original proposal, EPA would have an opportunity to evaluate fully the potential
health effects of truly new products before they enter the marketplace. On the other hand, F/FAs similar to those already
registered would not be arbitrarily kept from the market during the compliance period simply because of the relationship
between their date of introduction and the effective date of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA interprets section 211(e) to support the approach contained in this notice. EPA believes that the reference in
CAA section 211(e)(2) (A) and (B) to a ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' or ``which is not registered''
is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the F/FA generally or to a particular product-specific registration. Given
this ambiguity, EPA believes that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered''
to refer to the F/FAs generally. Further, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered'' to
include both F/FAs that are either ``registered'' or ``registrable.'' ``Registrable'' F/FAs are sufficiently
similar in composition and use to existing F/FAs that one would not expect them to have dissimilar health effects;
and therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered fuel or fuel additive'' to include not only those
F/FAs that are identical, but also those that can group with existing F/FAs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, EPA believes that the approach in this notice is consistent with section 211 because EPA interprets
section 211(e)(3) (A) and (B) in conjunction with section 211(e)(3)(C), which gives EPA authority to exempt any F/FA
from duplicative testing. Thus, even if one interprets the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which [is/is not] registered''
to mean either that an identical F/FA must already have a registration, or to refer to a product-specific registration,
EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret section 211(e)(3)(C) to allow F/FAs that are similar in composition and
usage to those already on the market to group with those similar F/FAs and complete the testing with the other F/FAs
in their group. At the same time, EPA believes that for F/FAs that differ significantly in composition or usage from
currently registered F/FAs, such testing would not be duplicative of testing of groups of registered F/FAs; and therefore,
EPA is authorized under section 211(e) to require this information prior to registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under either theory, EPA's authority to obtain information is not limited to Tier 1 and Tier 2 data, because section
211(b)(2)(B) gives EPA authority to require any information necessary to assess the effects of emissions on public
health or welfare. Therefore, EPA interprets section 211 (e) and (b) to give it the authority to require any necessary
health or welfare effects information for F/FAs that are significantly different in composition or usage from currently
registered products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comments on its interpretation of CAA section 211 as it applies to the approach outlined in this notice
and on the proposed compliance requirements for F/FA products which manufacturers may seek to register after promulgation
of this rule. EPA is proposing: (1) To allow those products fitting the definition of ``registrable'' to become registered
and thus subject to the same compliance and timing requirements as currently registered products, and (2) to require
manufacturers of ``new'' F/FAs (i.e., those not in conformance with the definition of ``registrable'') to submit
any information EPA requires, potentially including Tier 3, prior to registration. Based on its analysis of the public
comments on these proposed provisions, EPA may adopt both proposals, adopt one proposal, or reject both proposals.

B. Alternative Testing Requirements in Lieu of Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in the NPRM, the main purpose of the proposed rule is to obtain information for the identification and
evaluation of potential health effects of F/FA emissions in order to guide EPA in future regulatory actions. CAA section
211(b)(2)(A) gives EPA the authority to require the manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive ``to conduct tests to
determine potential public health effects of such fuel or additive (including, but not limited to, carcinogenic,
teratogenic, or mutagenic effects).'' Thus, the statute gives EPA discretion to require the examination of other
endpoints of concern in addition to the mandatory areas of testing described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tier 2 program in the NPRM proposed to establish a testing framework that incorporated the screening of several
health effects endpoints relevant to the assessment of the public health impacts of F/FA emissions, including those
endpoints mandated by the statute. In general, EPA still intends to maintain a standard Tier 2 biological testing
program as a requirement for registration. Thus, the prescribed Tier 2 tests to be included in the final rule would
apply to nearly all F/FAs seeking compliance with registration requirements, to the extent that the results of the
data search activities in Tier 1 do not include comparable existing information from adequately performed and properly
documented previous studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is now proposing a special provision which would give EPA discretion to require different testing requirements
in lieu of the standard Tier 2 program, in order to address specific health concerns for a particular fuel or fuel additive
product. EPA recognizes that, in some special cases, more exhaustive or specifically focused tests might be warranted
in lieu of the screening Tier 2 tests, based on already available health effects information. For example, for a particular
fuel or fuel additive product, information could already be available to EPA (independent of this proposed program)
which indicates that testing should be targeted to an identified health concern that is not specifically addressed
in Tier 2 or that calls for more definitive testing than would ordinarily occur under Tier 2. The currently proposed
testing program structure certainly allows EPA to require such tests under Tier 3 after the evaluation of the previous
tiers. However, in this special case, requiring more definitive tests or other appropriate endpoint tests earlier
in the testing program would result in overall savings to the manufacturer while providing EPA with the needed data
earlier to assess the potential health risks for the particular fuel or fuel additive in question. Under this special
provision EPA would also be able to prescribe additional tests to be performed along with the standard Tier 2 program
as well as substituting different tests. EPA asks for comments on this proposed provision that would allow EPA to prescribe
alternative tests in lieu of (or in addition to) the standard Tier 2 tests in special cases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If EPA decided to exercise its authority under this special provision, EPA would allow an appropriate time for completion
of the prescribed tests. For instance, if ancillary tests to Tier 2 were prescribed for a registered F/FA, the usual
three-year timeframe for completing Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements would no longer apply. Instead, EPA would allow
additional time for completion of the alternative testing program (i.e., Tier 2 as well as the ancillary tests prescribed
under this provision) in this special case. Similar compliance allowances would be made if different tests (e.g.,
chronic tests) were prescribed in lieu of the standard Tier 2 screening tests. For registered F/FAs, EPA would notify
the manufacturer (or group) by certified mail letter, within eighteen months of promulgation of the final rule, of
the specific tests to be done in lieu of the standard Tier 2 regimen, along with a schedule for compliance and submittal
of test results. A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice would also be published to give the public opportunity to comment on the intended testing regimen. A public
hearing would not be held, however. The responsible manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) would have 60 days to
comment on the prescribed tests and timing requirements. If the responsible manufacturer did not provide any comments,
EPA would assume that the manufacturer had consented in full with the prescribed testing program. Similar notification
arrangements would apply to manufacturers of currently unregistered F/FAs. In this instance, EPA would notify the
new applicant (by certified mail letter) of the nonstandard requirements within eighteen months of EPA's learning
of the manufacturer's intent to register a product. EPA welcomes comments on the proposed notification and comment
procedures for this special provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, EPA considers the normal Tier 2 testing regimen to be applicable, appropriate, and valuable for the health
effects evaluation of F/FA emissions, even if higher-level testing is later required under the provisions of Tier
3. Thus, EPA would exercise the special authority to prescribe other testing requirements in addition to or in lieu
of the standard Tier 2 regimen only in exceptional cases. The exercise of this authority would be done wholly at EPA's
discretion. F/FA manufacturers would be specifically discouraged from submitting applications or requests to
EPA for Tier 2 substitutions, and EPA would be under no obligation to consider or respond to any such requests.

A. General Emission Generation Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed that F/FA manufacturers would be required to conduct a detailed characterization of the emissions
of their products, as well as biological tests in which animals are exposed to these emissions. The use of applicable
portions of the standard Federal Test Procedure (FTP) was proposed for generating exhaust emissions for these purposes.
For biological testing of products predominantly used in light-duty vehicle applications, EPA proposed the use
of one light-duty vehicle operating over continuous, repeated Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycles
(i.e., a transient speed driving sequence used to simulate typical urban driving) performed on a chassis dynamometer.
An engine dynamometer operated on the Engine Dynamometer Schedule (EDS) was presented as an option. The EDS is a transient
engine speed versus torque time sequence commonly used in heavy-duty engine evaluation. It was proposed that the
EDS would be used to generate emissions in heavy-duty applications. EPA also proposed that all test vehicles and engines
should possess all of the emission control equipment normally recommended by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their comments on the NPRM, the regulated industry questioned the appropriateness of using the FTP to generate
emissions for biological testing, given the inherent variable nature of FTP-generated emissions. In response to
these comments, EPA is considering several alternative approaches as discussed below. EPA asks for comments on the
suitability of these proposals and on alternative methods suitable for the generation of emissions to be used in the
biological testing of F/FAs. To be most useful, such comments should include a detailed discussion on the recommended
methodology, including advantages and disadvantages.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is considering the use of non-transient methods as an alternative approach to FTP or other transient cycles to
reduce the potential variability in the emission stream. The rationale behind this approach is discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination of an exposure/health effect relationship requires a constant, well-controlled, and measurable
exposure environment. A high degree of variability in emission properties such as heat, pressure, water vapor, CO,
NOx, CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, total hydrocarbons, and specific chemical composition could complicate the measurement and determination of
the actual exposure levels that occur during toxicology testing. During transient cycles, physical and chemical
properties of the exhaust stream can vary significantly. In addition, a high percentage of emissions are produced
in concentrated spikes (related to the enriched conditions present during accelerations) that result in a series
of alternating high and low level exposures. This variability could be difficult to accommodate in the context of
the inhalation toxicology tests proposed in this rule. Therefore, EPA is considering the use of single-mode (steady
state) operating conditions for generating emissions in the F/FA testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to reducing variability, non-transient methods might also provide a better simulation of ambient conditions.
Ambient air contains emissions from many thousands of vehicles of varying technologies, age, and state of maintenance.
At any point in time, these vehicles are in different stages of operation under various engine loads. As a collective
average of the emissions from these sources, the ambient air typically varies gradually over a period of hours or days.
In contrast, UDDS emissions vary significantly from second to second. For these reasons, the ambient air actually
resembles a steady state condition more closely than a transient state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potential advantage of running the test vehicle or engine under single-mode conditions is that it would permit
less sophisticated and less expensive dynamometer equipment (e.g., water-brake dynamometers) to be used for emission
generation. This could help to encourage additional biological testing laboratories to obtain the equipment necessary
for conducting the test exposures required in this program, and might also increase the feasibility of using portable
dynamometers for these purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the use of a non-transient rather than a transient cycle for generating emissions raises legitimate
concerns that the emission stream could be missing certain toxicologically active species which would ordinarily
be generated in appreciable amounts only during accelerations. However, these concerns might be allayed to some
extent by two other emission generation specifications which EPA is considering: the use of engine-out (non-catalyzed)
rather than tailpipe catalyzed emissions (see section III.A.2, below) and the use of high-load, fuel-enriched operating
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To maximize the emission species occuring in the exhaust stream during non-transient operation, EPA is considering
different vehicle/engine operating specifications or emission performance requirements. One approach under
consideration is to specify the speed and throttle requirements, e.g., 25 percent of full throttle at a constant speed
of 20 mph (the average speed of the FTP). An alternative method would be to specify a high load requirement directly
(e.g., 50 percent load at 20 mph). One factor to consider is that the vehicle/engine operating conditions must be achievable
without exceeding the load which a typical well-maintained, modern engine can handle for prolonged periods of time
without breaking down. EPA requests comments and advice on this practical constraint. A different approach would
be to require the modification of electronic computer controls to manage fuel injection so as to achieve a suitably
enriched air/fuel ratio under steady-state operation. Programming a vehicle to operate in open-loop mode is one
example of this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than specifying the operating conditions to be used during non-transient vehicle/engine operation, EPA
could choose to specify performance criteria which would achieve suitable emission levels. These criteria would
be based on selected exhaust or exposure concentrations of key emissions for biological testing (e.g., CO, total
HC). This approach would allow operators the flexibility to determine the most appropriate vehicle/engine conditions
and/or computer controls needed to obtain an exhaust stream containing the required concentration ranges of specific
emissions. For example, EPA could require that the concentration of total hydrocarbons in the exhaust must exceed
a specified amount and/or that the CO concentration be less than a specified maximum. Because different test vehicles/engines
would be required to meet the same criteria, this approach might reduce the potential test-to-test variability which
might result if EPA were to specify a particular set of operating conditions and require that set to be applied across
all vehicle/engine technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA invites comments on the possibility of using a non-transient cycle rather than the FTP for generating emissions
for biological testing. Specific comments are requested on the effectiveness of the various approaches discussed
above for achieving the desired emission enrichment during steady-state operation. Comments on the specific speed,
throttle, load specifications, computer controls, and/or performance criteria mentioned above are also requested,
and suggestions as to suitable alternative methods or specifications are welcome. Such suggestions will be particularly
helpful if supporting data and rationale are provided. Detailed emission speciation data/profiles contrasting
engine/vehicle operating conditions (e.g., transient versus non-transient, especially under engine-out conditions)
are also solicited.

2. Alternative Approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although EPA is considering steady state conditions for the generation of emissions in the final rule, it has not excluded
the possibility of using the previously proposed FTP method or other transient or semi-transient (e.g., multi-modal)
methods. EPA solicits detailed comments on whether transient methods are necessary to ensure that toxicologically
significant species will not be unintentionally omitted from the emission stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering the use of emission conditioning techniques that could potentially accommodate transient cycle
emission generation within the context of the F/FA inhalation toxicity testing program. One option being considered
would use constant dilution ratio equipment (e.g., the mini-diluter or variable flow rate ``constant volume sampling''
(VFR&hyph;CVS) systems) being developed and evaluated in the American Industry/Government Emissions Research,
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (AIGER CRADA) to limit the transient variability characteristics
of classical CVS (variable dilution ratio) exhaust. With this equipment, the diluent can be managed to achieve desired
CO, CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and water vapor concentrations (e.g., to avoid animal asphyxiation or water condensation) and sample temperatures
prior to being directed to the biological exposure chambers. Concentration swings will occur when the engine air/fuel
ratio diverges from stoichiometric combustion, but for only short durations of time. EPA recognizes that this is
a developing technology and invites comments, suggestions, and supporting data on its possible application in the

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
F/FA biological testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative that would allow management of the variability of transient vehicle exhaust is use of a mixing
chamber between the classical CVS source and the exposure chamber. The transient exhaust would be injected into a
large dilution/mixing/integration chamber prior to its delivery to the animal exposure chamber. This would allow
necessary adjustment of the exhaust concentrations and integration of the large concentration swings typical of
CVS exhaust, prior to exposing the animals. The mixing chamber would be charged from the CVS at a constant rate determined
by the exposure chamber purge rate. The exposure chamber flow could begin at the conclusion of the initial transient
cycle with the associated mixing chamber charge. EPA requests comments on the feasibility of using mixing chambers
to condition diluted transient exhaust for animal exposure in the context of the F/FA testing program.

3. Engine-Out Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also considering the use of engine-out (i.e., non-catalyzed) rather than catalyzed tailpipe emissions for
biological testing, to assure that the test animals will be exposed to the full range of emission species potentially
resulting from the combustion of F/FAs. With modern emission control technology in place, most of the ambient air
pollutant species attributable to automobile exhaust come from two sources: malfunctioning vehicles (``high emitters'')
and normal vehicles during their cold start period, when their engines run rich and their catalytic converters have
not yet reached effective operating temperatures. The variety of emissions from these two important sources are
not well represented by hot, catalyzed exhaust generated from well-maintained, modern vehicles. Emissions during
the cold-start include hundreds of organic chemical species which are generated before the catalytic converter
reaches its effective temperature. Once the catalytic converter is warmed-up, its efficiency increases to the point
where only a dozen or so simple compounds remain in readily measurable amounts in the catalyzed exhaust. Thus, the
use of treated exhaust in the biological testing program would expose the laboratory animals to only a very few of the
organic emission species associated with the combustion of the fuel or additive of interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
testing requires continuous air changes in the animal chambers to avoid confounding health effects (e.g., lung and
skin irritations, hypoxia, bacterial infections, heat exhaustion, etc.) caused by a build-up of metabolic by-products
(e.g., CO

, ammonia, humidity and body heat) of the animal test population. Because of the need for frequent air changes, the
initial cold-start emissions would remain in the exposure chamber for only a few minutes before being flushed out.
Assuming catalyzed emissions were used, the remaining hours of each day's test period would expose the animals only
to the relatively few species that remain in hot, treated exhaust. Thus, the use of catalyzed exhaust for biological
exposures could exclude from the tests relevant emission species that could potentially be harmful to human health
or the environment. In contrast, the ambient air normally contains the full range of combustion emissions, since
cold-start emissions are continuously re-introduced and some ``high emitters'' are always in operation. Since
humans experience continuous exposure to these emissions, EPA believes it is important that they be included in the
test exposure atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several possible methods have been considered for increasing the frequency and/or duration of biological exposures
to actual cold-start emissions. These included the use of emission storage and retrieval systems, use of an enhanced
engine and exhaust cooling system, and the use of a fleet of identical vehicles that could be interchanged to provide
natural cooling periods. However, each of these methods could introduce still more technical challenges. Thus,
EPA believes that production of a constant supply of genuine cold-start emissions could be an impractical requirement
for the type of toxicology tests required in this program. Comments and suggestions on these issues are welcome.

Instead of attempting to produce a constant supply of cold-start emissions, EPA is considering the possibility of
requiring manufacturers to use engine-out emissions as a surrogate for cold-start emissions. Recognizing that
an ineffective catalytic converter is the major (though not only) vehicle-related factor which differentiates
the cold start, EPA has compared cold-start emissions and high-emitting vehicle emissions to engine-out emissions
using available emission data. This analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 showed that, in terms of both chemical composition and relative concentrations, engine-out organic emissions closely
resemble cold-start and high-emitting vehicle emissions. In addition, a comparison of FTP composite emissions
showed that engine-out and tailpipe organic emission species were nearly the same on a qualitative basis, although
the engine-out emissions appeared at a greater overall concentration. Thus, bypassing the catalyst produced emissions
representing a comprehensive aggregate of characteristic combustion products at enriched concentrations, including
the species which are otherwise emitted only during the cold start. The enrichment of organic emissions is an important
side benefit for the biological testing program because richer hydrocarbon streams will be available for toxicology
testing for any given level of CO

 and water vapor. (It should be noted, however, that CO levels are also raised, and may themselves become a limiting
factor.) EPA requests comments on the use of engine-out emissions for the F/FA biological testing program and welcomes
suggestions regarding this proposal or other alternative approaches. To be most useful, such comments should include
supporting emission data.

With the exception of exhaust after-treatment devices, EPA proposes that all normally required emission control
equipment be present and fully operational on all test vehicles and heavy-duty engines used in the generation of engine-out
emissions. This may require replacing catalytic converters and particulate traps with other devices capable of
simulating the back pressure, residence time, and mixing characteristics usually provided by these devices. Another
approach could be to install a blank catalyst (no catalytic wash coat) in the exhaust system where the production catalyst
would normally be installed. EPA requests comments and suggestions on this or other suitable alternative methods
that would ensure the appropriate operation of the exhaust system.

B. Mileage Accumulation for the Testing of Atypical F/FAs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed 25,000 miles as the minimum mileage which must be accumulated on the emission-generation
vehicle before generating emissions for characterization and animal testing purposes. For fuels and fuel additives
containing atypical elements, mileage accumulation was proposed to continue after 25,000 miles, if needed, until
the emissions of the atypical element(s) reached steady state or until the vehicle or engine has been operated for
80 percent of its estimated useful life (e.g., 80,000 miles for light-duty vehicles). ``Steady state'' was defined
in the proposal as the point at which the mass of the atypical elements emitted during the performance of one or more
UDDS or engine dynamometer schedules is within 10 percent of the mass of the atypical elements that entered the combustion
chamber during the driving cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based in part on comments received from the regulated industry, EPA is now considering different mileage accumulation
approaches. In the case of a fuel or fuel/additive mixture meeting baseline or non-baseline criteria, EPA believes
that an accumulation of 4,000 miles on a light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck or 125 hours on a heavy-duty vehicle
(fueled exclusively with the fuel or fuel/additive mixture to be tested), should be sufficient to stabilize emissions.
The 4,000 mile/125 hour mileage accumulation requirements are consistent with the emission stabilization procedures
used for emission-data vehicles in EPA's new vehicle certification program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of F/FAs with atypical elements, EPA is concerned that the requirement to reach a mass-balance steady state
prior to generating emissions for testing might be too stringent. In fact, in some cases, a measured input-output
mass balance might never be reached. Thus, EPA is considering a different approach for atypical F/FAs. The minimum
mileage accumulation that vehicles/engines testing atypical F/FAs would be required to undergo would be 4,000 miles,
the same mileage accumulation now proposed for the testing of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. After completion
of the 4,000 miles, the F/FA manufacturer would be required to identify and measure the atypical element(s) in the
exhaust, if possible. Because the presence of the atypical species in specific emission fractions will be dependent
on the nature of the particular atypical element, EPA would recommend examination of all emission fractions (i.e.,
vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate). If the atypical element(s) of interest are not detected in at least one of
the emission fractions after 4,000 miles, the manufacturer would then need to continue mileage accumulation until
the atypical element(s) are at high enough level(s) for accurate identification and measurement. The intervals
at which the emissions should be examined for detection of the atypical element(s) is proposed to be left to the manufacturer's
discretion. Once the atypical element(s) of interest are detected in at least one emission fraction, an additional
10,000 miles would be required prior to generation of emissions for purposes of emission characterization and biological
testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comments and suggestions on the proposed mileage accumulation requirements for baseline, non-baseline,
and atypical F/FAs. If alternative approaches are provided, EPA requests commenters to include supporting data
and a detailed discussion so as to allow an appropriate analysis of the options.

C. Base Fuel Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed the use of base fuels to represent theoretical ``industry average'' or normative formulations
for each defined fuel family. EPA was to develop chemical and physical specifications to define a specific base fuel
(including a minimum required additive package) for each fuel family. The base fuels were proposed to serve as the
group representatives in compliance with testing requirements for baseline F/FA groups. The base fuels were also
proposed to serve as the fuel substrates into which additives which were undergoing evaluation would be mixed prior
to emission generation and testing. Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel would then serve as controls
against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture would be compared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although base fuel definitions for the conventional fuel families (gasoline and diesel) were discussed in a memorandum
to the docket (``Base Fuel Determination Procedures for the Proposed Fuels and Fuel Additives Rulemaking,'' see
Public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07), EPA did not specify at that time the required additive package for conventional
fuels or the base fuel specifications for alternative fuels. The proposed specifications for the unleaded gasoline
and diesel base fuels are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Comments are requested on these specifications,
with particular emphasis on the additive functions proposed to be included in each base fuel. The base additive packages
are intended to include only those additive functions that are essential for fuel production or engine operation
and/or those required by law. Selection of the specific product within each specified additive functional category
would be up to the formulator of the base fuel and/or the test operator. However, additive products which include elements
other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen would not be allowed as part of the base fuel/additive formulation.
The base additives would be required to be used at their minimum effective concentrations in the base fuel.

EPA has also developed proposed base fuel specifications for alternative fuels, based on California Air Resources
Board (CARB) definitions and other available information. EPA requests comments on the proposed base fuel specifications,
discussed below for each alternative fuel family. At this time, much less in-use data is available for alternative
fuels than for conventional fuels, and some of these fuels and their associated vehicle/engine technologies are
still under development. EPA thus proposes to allow some flexibility (with specific EPA approval) in the base fuel
formulations specified for the alternative fuel families, if necessitated by technological changes occurring
after final promulgation of the specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such changes might be particularly necessary in regard to the additives specified to be used as part of the base fuels.
For example, the proposed M100 base fuel (see below) is specified to contain no additives. This proposed specification
reflects EPA's understanding that M100 fuel is currently used without additives in heavy-duty buses in California.
However, as experience accumulates and/or if other M100 vehicle technologies become predominant, the need for a
minimum complement of additives (such as agents to increase the lubricity or auto-ignition characteristics of M100)
may become evident. In such cases, EPA would review and (if justified) approve requests from alternative fuel manufacturers
to modify the base fuel (and/or additive) specifications. Such requests would generally be deemed to be justified
if consistent with the associated vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for operation of the vehicle. Public
notice of any approved changes to the base fuels (and/or their additive components) would be published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM, the baseline category within the methanol fuel family would contain two F/FA groups: the M100
group (to include methanol formulations with at least 96 percent methanol by volume) and the M85 group (to include
methanol formulations with 50&hyph;95 percent methanol by volume). Each of these baseline methanol groups would
have its own base fuel. These base fuels would contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
sulfur, and chlorine. The chlorine (as chloride) would be permitted as a contaminant remaining from methanol production,
and would be limited to no more than 0.0001 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not exceed 0.002 percent by mass in
the M100 base fuel and may not exceed 0.004 percent by mass in the M85 base fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The M100 base fuel would be required to consist of 100 percent by volume chemical grade methanol. The M85 base fuel would
contain 85 percent by volume chemical grade methanol, blended with 15 volume percent unleaded gasoline base fuel
(as described in Table 1). No additives other than those contained in the gasoline base fuel component would be allowed.
Specifications for the methanol base fuels are presented in Table 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Some gasoline detergents have been shown to cause intake system deposits when used in M85 applications. Likewise,
lubricating oils containing calcium have been shown to cause injector tip deposits in M100 applications. Therefore,
EPA recommends that F/FA producers determine the methanol compatibility of lubricating oils as well as fuel additives
used in the gasoline portion of the M85 base fuel. EPA requests comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Ethanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed two baseline groups for the ethanol fuel family: E100 group and E85 group. However, EPA is
now considering defining only one group for baseline ethanol formulations. This single baseline ethanol group would
be represented by E85 base fuel. The rationale behind this proposal is that fuel ethanol is required to contain at least
5 percent denaturant, which means that, in actuality, E100 formulations contain only 95 percent ethanol (i.e., E95).
Furthermore, gasoline is normally used as the denaturant for ethanol fuels. EPA believes that there would be little
incremental value in requiring tests of E95 in addition to E85, and thus proposes to create a single baseline ethanol
group represented by an E85 base fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The E85 base fuel would contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and
copper. The chlorine (as chloride) would be permitted as a contaminant remaining from ethanol production, and would
be limited to no more than 0.0004 percent by mass. The sulfur content in the E85 base fuel may not exceed 0.004 percent
by mass. Copper, also a contaminant from ethanol production, would be limited to 0.07 mg/L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The E85 base fuel would contain 85 percent by volume chemical grade ethanol, blended with 15 volume percent unleaded
gasoline base fuel. No additives, beyond those included in the gasoline base fuel portion of the ethanol blends, would
be included in the E85 base fuel. Additives used in the gasoline component of E85 should be ethanol-compatible. A summary
of the ethanol base fuel specifications is provided in Table 4.

3. Methane (CNG, LNG) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The methane fuel family would be represented by a natural gas base fuel whose elemental composition is limited to CHONS,
with the sulfur present only as an odorant for leak detection purposes and limited to 16 parts per million (by volume).
The added odorant should be used at a level such that at ambient conditions the fuel must have a distinctive odor potent
enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of
flammability. No other additives would be included in the base fuel. The proposed methane base fuel specifications
are presented in Table 5.

4. Propane (LPG) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Special-duty propane, as defined in ASTM specification D&hyph;1835, is proposed to serve as the propane base fuel.
The propane base fuel may contain no elements other than CHONS, with the sulfur present as an added odorant for leak
detection purposes and limited to 120 ppm (by weight). The added odorant should be used at a level such that at ambient
conditions the fuel must have a distinctive odor potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration
in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of flammability. No other additive would be allowed included in
the base fuel. The proposed base fuel specifications for propane are presented in Table 6.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) requests public comments on a proposed rule that would annually allocate the
U.S. Pacific whiting harvest guideline or quota, in 1994 through 1996, between: Fishing vessels that either catch
and process at sea or catch and deliver to at-sea processors; and fishing vessels that deliver to processors located
on shore. In each of the 3 years, after 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline (or quota) for whiting is taken, further
at-sea processing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) would be prohibited, and the remaining 40 percent (104,000
metric tons (mt) in 1994) would be reserved initially for fishing vessels that deliver to shore-based processors.
On or about August 15, any amount of the harvest guideline (including any part of the 40 percent initially held in reserve)
that is determined by the Northwest Regional Director, NMFS, not to be needed by the shoreside sector during the remainder
of the year would be made available to the at-sea processing sector. This action is intended to promote the goals and
objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) by providing for equitable sharing of the
harvest guideline between shore-based and at-sea processors; by contributing to the economies of coastal communities
by providing reasonable opportunity for shoreside processing of the whiting harvest guideline; and by promoting
stability in the west coast fishing industry by diverting effort from other fully-utilized fisheries.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NOAA is issuing a proposed rule based on a recommendation of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), under
the authority of the FMP and the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are
managed by the Secretary according to the FMP prepared by the Council under the authority of the Magnuson Act. The FMP
is implemented by regulations for U.S. fishermen at 50 CFR part 663. General regulations applicable to U.S. fishermen
are at 50 CFR part 620. The FMP has been amended 6 times. Amendment 4 contains a framework process (the socio-economic
framework) that provides the authority, guidelines, and criteria for establishing management measures that address
social and economic conditions within the fishery. These measures can be implemented by regulation, without further
amending the FMP, through the procedures contained in Amendment 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific whiting is the largest groundfish resource managed by the Council, and makes up over 50 percent of the potential
annual groundfish harvest. Prior to 1980, this species was harvested primarily by foreign fishing vessels. Foreign
directed fishing for whiting ended in 1989, when all the available whiting were allocated to U.S. fishermen, mostly
for delivery of raw fish to foreign processing vessels under joint venture arrangements. By mid-1990 it was clear
that over-capacity of the harvesting and processing sectors in the Alaska groundfish fisheries was causing shorter
fishing seasons and that participants were looking for alternative resources, both inside and outside Alaska.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991, the Council recommended, and the Secretary approved, a proposal to allocate the 228,000-mt 1991 Pacific
whiting quota 104,000 mt to catcher/processors and 88,000 mt to fishing vessels that do not process (including vessels
that delivered whiting both to shoreside plants and to motherships), with 36,000 mt reserved for priority access
for the shoreside sector (56 FR 43718, September 4, 1991). The actual 1991 harvest was 117,000 mt by factory trawlers,
80,000 mt delivered to motherships, and 21,000 mt delivered to shoreside processors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, no more than 98,800 mt of whiting initially could be processed at sea, 80,000 mt was allocated to vessels delivering
to shoreside processors, and 30,000 mt was retained in reserve with a priority for use by the shoreside sector. The
30,000-mt reserve was released to at-sea processing operations on September 4, and an additional 24,000 mt of the
initial shoreside allocation was made available for at-sea processing on October 1. In 1992, factory trawlers again
harvested 117,000 mt, motherships received 36,000 mt and 56,000 mt was delivered to shoreside processing plants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the first 112,000 mt of the 142,000 mt harvest guideline was available for open competition (``olympic fishery''),
with the remaining 30,000 mt held in reserve for shoreside processing. This assumed that vessels delivering shoreside
would harvest about 12,000 mt during the olympic fishery, for a total of 42,000 mt for the year. When it became apparent
that shoreside deliveries were substantially lower than expected during the olympic fishery, an emergency rule
was issued that prohibited processing at sea when 100,000 mt was taken by the at-sea processing sector. Therefore,
42,000 mt was reserved for vessels delivering shoreside in 1993. The regulations also included a provision for releasing
any unneeded portion of the shoreside allocation on September 1, to ensure the harvest guideline would be fully utilized.
However, shore-based processors used their entire allocation and no additional whiting were made available for
processing at sea in 1993. The at-sea processing sector harvested 99,103 mt in 1993 (84,588 mt by catcher/processors
and 14,515 mt by vessels that delivered to motherships). Shore-based landings were about 41,859 mt in 1993. In total,
140,962 mt of whiting were caught in 1993, over 99 percent of the 142,000 mt harvest guideline.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fleet composition in the 1994 whiting fishery may be quite different than in 1992 and 1993. A license limitation
(``limited entry'') program was implemented under Amendment 6 to the FMP, and became effective on January 1, 1994.
The limited entry program requires trawl vessels targeting on groundfish to have a limited entry permit. Limited
entry permits were issued to vessels that landed a minimum amount of groundfish during the window period (July 11,
1984_August 1, 1988). Permits also were issued to vessels purchased or under construction or conversion during the
window period that later had a certain level of participation in the fishery. The permits may be bought and sold. Therefore,
the traditional vessels that were active in the whiting fishery during the window period initially received permits
while entrants after 1988 (which includes the catcher/processor fleet) are not able to operate in the fishery unless
they buy or lease permits sufficient for these vessels to operate. In 1993, 16 catcher/processors operated in the
whiting fishery. As of January 20, 1994, it appears that one catcher/processor may initially receive a limited entry
permit while several others might acquire enough limited entry permits to operate as a catcher/processor (rather
than a mothership) in the 1994 whiting fishery. However, the catcher/processor fleet is expected to be much smaller
than in 1992 and 1993_the whiting market is weak and too few permits are likely to be available for purchase to accommodate
the entire whiting catcher/processor fleet. The final composition of the whiting fleet for 1994 and beyond will not
be known until the fishery is underway, but it is clear that future participation by the catcher/processor fleet will
be constrained by implementation of the limited entry program in 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of the Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the fishing and processing sectors of the whiting fishery continue to be overcapitalized, which means there
is more capacity than needed to take and to process the entire harvest guideline. The at-sea processing sector is more
mobile and thus able to follow whiting that migrate from south to north during the March&hyph;October/November fishing
season. Catcher/processors and catcher vessels delivering to motherships do not lose fishing time by having to return
to shore to offload. Until 1994, there have been more at-sea processing vessels (as many as 26 in a given year) than shore-based
plants (10&hyph;12 major plants). The at-sea processing fleet generally prefers shorter, intense seasons to minimize
operating costs, and to ``fill in'' between other fisheries, particularly the pollock fisheries off Alaska. The
shore-based plants clearly are not mobile and are limited by the availability of whiting as it migrates within range
of local ports. Shore-based processing plants tend to prefer a longer, slower season to maintain their work force
and markets when other fisheries are less productive. Even under limited entry, the potential exists for the at-sea
processing sector to preempt the shoreside sector's opportunity for a longer processing season if enough at-sea
processing capacity enters the whiting fishery. Although limited entry may reduce the number of catcher/processors
that harvest whiting, it has no effect on the number of at-sea processors that may choose to offer at-sea markets to
catcher boats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shore-based fleet and processing plants now are established components of the whiting industry, not likely to
be totally preempted by the at-sea fleet. They are, however, vulnerable to severe economic impacts should landings
be precipitously reduced by unrestricted at-sea processing taking much of the harvest guideline in a fast, early
fishery. The Council believes that even partial preemption of shoreside processing opportunities will result in
an inequitable redistribution of economic benefits between sectors of the industry. The greatest change in the fishery
in 1994 will be due to implementation of the limited entry program. Even though the traditional catcher vessels might
appear to be protected from the rapid and intense competition of the catcher/processor fleet, concern remains that
market opportunities might be severely restricted by an at-sea processing fleet consisting of motherships (including
former catcher/processors acting as motherships) or of catcher/processors accumulating enough permits to operate
in the fishery. The mothership fleet provides a viable market for the traditional catcher vessels, and to this extent
is beneficial to the catcher fleet. However, if the mothership fishery attracts a large number of catcher/processors
acting only as motherships, and if they are able to process whiting almost as rapidly as when they acted as catcher/processors
(which is expected), the harvest guideline still could be taken in a matter of weeks (as early as May 31, 1994, according
to Table 7&hyph;2 in the EA/RIR). The Council believes the traditional catcher fleet's market opportunities are
enhanced when there are viable, competing markets both onshore and offshore over a longer period of time, and therefore
a less intense, slower fishery appears to benefit market choices for these vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also is concerned that preemption of harvesting opportunities for whiting catcher boats will result
in those vessels transferring additional fishing effort into the traditional groundfish fisheries for rockfish,
sablefish, and flatfish, which already are fully utilized. Increased effort in the non-whiting groundfish fishery
could result in shortened seasons and more restrictive trip limits for all groundfish fishing vessels, could economically
disadvantage many fishermen, and could exacerbate the current problem of excessive discards and wastage attributed
to restrictive regulations. To the extent that the Council can maintain employment for the traditional joint venture
fishing vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery, adverse impacts on the other groundfish fisheries will be lessened.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Council and the industry desire stability in the regulatory process. For each of the last 3 years,
the Council submitted recommendations for allocations to the Secretary. Uncertainty as to what the allocation would
be and delays in announcing the allocation prevented participants in the whiting fishery from planning their harvesting
and processing operations prior to the season. The industry was unable to plan ahead because it did not have a firm foundation
on which to base its business decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the problems the Council has identified and is seeking to solve are: Too much fishing and processing capacity
and not enough fish; inequitable distribution of economic benefits among the competing sectors; and regulatory
instability that has prevented the industry from making timely business decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Ensure that [the] shore-based sector has reasonable opportunity to participate; (2) foster stability of shore-based
processing sector by providing replacement revenues for other faltering fisheries; (3) help stabilize faltering
rural coastal economies by providing fishing, processing and supporting industry revenues to replace income declines
in other industries; (4) achieve maximum net benefit to the nation by putting economic benefits directly into coastal
communities and distributing income impacts/benefits along traditional geographic paths; (5) spread fishery
over time and area, reducing potential pulse fishery impacts on whiting, salmon and rockfish stocks; (6) prevent
effort shift to other species; (7) address management of the entire groundfish resource rather than piecemeal; (8)
contribute to increased long-term product yield and employment opportunities by spreading harvest over a longer
season; (9) discourage additional capital investment in harvesting or processing facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council convened an ad hoc industry subcommittee in July 1993 in Portland, Oregon, to develop an allocation option
that would be acceptable to all sectors. The subcommittee included a representative from each major sector in the
whiting industry: catcher vessels delivering at-sea, shoreside, and ``at-large;'' shoreside processors; catcher/processors;
and mothership processors. The ad hoc committee, after considering a number of alternatives, successfully negotiated
a 3-year agreement that was acceptable to all participants, and subsequently was adopted by the Council and recommended
to the Secretary (Option 1 in the EA/RIR or the proposed rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council's recommendation provides that the first 60 percent of the annual whiting harvest guideline will be available
to all vessels in open competition. The remaining 40 percent is reserved initially for shore-based activities. When
the 60 percent has been harvested, no further at-sea processing will be allowed for the remainder of the year or until
August 15, when an additional portion of the harvest guideline may be made available. NMFS will assess how much of the
harvest guideline will be utilized by shore-based processors during the remainder of the year, and any surplus to
shore-based needs will be made available to all permitted vessels on August 15. The allocation would remain in effect
for 3 years, 1994&hyph;1996. Any Pacific whiting harvested or processed in state ocean waters (0&hyph;3 nautical
miles offshore) will be counted toward the EEZ limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also considered the alternatives of continuing the 1993 percentages (of 30 percent for vessels delivering
shoreside and 70 percent for at-sea processing (Option 2 in the EA/RIR), and continuing the ``olympic''-style fishery
with no allocations to either sector (Option 3 in the EA/RIR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ad hoc committee also reached a consensus agreement to assume that only the traditional whiting catcher fleet
(limited entry vessels with ``A'' permits) would be allowed to operate in the whiting fishery. The Committee believed
that the limited entry fleet, which contains approximately 40 catcher vessels from the traditional whiting fishery
and possibly one catcher/processor, is sufficient to harvest any likely harvest guideline for whiting in the next
3 years. However, NOAA cannot foresee what choices fishermen will make and cannot guarantee that the entire harvest
guideline will be taken by the current limited entry fleet. Participation in the limited entry fishery is determined
under Amendment 6 to the FMP, which allows for participation by vessels that are not in the current limited entry fleet
(by issuance of ``designated species B permits''), based on seniority in the fishery, if the current limited entry
fleet will not use the entire harvest guideline. Therefore, the FMP provides for temporary participation by vessels
that do not have ``A'' permits to ensure that the harvest guideline for whiting will be fully utilized.

Impacts of the Proposed Rule

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The socio-economic framework in the FMP, under which this action is taken, requires the Council to consider a number
of factors in its recommendation to directly allocate the resource among users. (See section III.C.3 of the appendix
to 50 CFR part 663.) One factor that must be considered by the Council is ``any consensus harvest sharing agreement
or negotiated settlement between the affected participants in the fishery.'' However, the fact that an agreement
has been negotiated is not in itself a sufficient basis for the Secretary to approve the Council's recommendation.
The socio-economic framework also requires consideration of a number of biological, social, and economic factors,
as well as consistency with the goals and objectives of the FMP, the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. These factors
are more fully discussed in the Council's EA/RIR (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In its analysis, the Council developed a model to predict how much whiting would be taken by each sector under each option
and under certain conditions and assumptions (section 7.2.3 of the EA/RIR). The resulting ranges of estimated production
for the shore-based sector are listed in the following table.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
No significant biological or environmental impact is expected as a result of the proposed rule. The bycatch of rockfish
and salmon is expected to be similar whether the proposed rule is implemented. Although it is possible that a short,
intense pulse fishery could have localized impacts on bycatch species, it also provides the potential for avoiding
species more likely to be caught at other times of year. The incentive to minimize bycatch may be less if the season is
short and vessels race to take their allocation. However, observers have been carried onboard both the at-sea processors
and shore-based catcher vessels for the purpose of monitoring bycatch. In general, bycatch rates of yellowtail rockfish
and Pacific ocean perch are more likely to increase if the fishery occurs predominantly in the northern areas, and
bycatch of bocaccio/chilipepper rockfish are more likely to increase if fishing occurs off California. A number
of regulations were implemented in 1993 for the purpose of minimizing bycatch of salmon and rockfish in the whiting
fishery (50 CFR 663.23(b)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Council heard testimony that a later and longer season would benefit the whiting resource because the
fish would be larger later in the season and it would take fewer fish to fill the harvest guideline, the actual difference
in yield is small. An analysis conducted in 1992 indicated that even if the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
entire 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
harvest guideline were taken in September compared to April, the potential increase in yield would be about 10 percent.
This 10 percent would include increases to liver and gonad weight, and therefore is not likely to represent an equal
increase in marketable flesh. Since none of the options considered by the Council provided for the entire fishery
being taken in September, the increase in yield from an extended season would be less than 10 percent.

Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic cost-benefit analysis developed by the Council for the 1993 allocation did not provide adequate information
to support any allocation decision. However, one more year of fishing and marketing experience, and revised data
were incorporated into a new analysis. Even though data were available in the recent analysis that did not exist at
the time the previous analysis was prepared, the results still should be interpreted with caution and are contingent
on assumptions about the effects of limited entry, and the quality of the data. However, given these limitations,
the Council's cost/benefit analysis does provide consistent ranking of the three options, suggesting that the proposed
rule may provide the greatest net economic benefit to the nation, even though the amount of that difference may be quite
small. In all instances the no allocation option (Option 3) was ranked lowest in terms of net economic benefit to the
nation. The differences between Options 1 and 2 were insignificant in most cases. Three important factors, based
on 1993 prices, appear to drive the results: (1) Shore-based headed and gutted operations are the most profitable
(highest net economic benefit); (2) shore-based waste utilization adds to the net economic benefit; and (3) surimi
prices are highest for catcher/processors. Applying the new data to assumed levels of participation by each sector,
and using observed prices, the total difference between the proposed rule and the no allocation option is only about
$3 million over the three-year period. Even though the exact dollar amount may not be known, this indicates a small
economic difference among the options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council concluded that although the net economic benefits are similar for Options 1 and 2, the no allocation (Option
3) was clearly inferior. In short, the cost-benefit analysis concluded that shore-based activities appear to produce
a slightly greater net economic benefit, in part due to the slower operating pace and to the multi-faceted nature of
the shore-based sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Council perceives a clearer difference between the options with respect to distributional effects,
believing maintenance of a robust shore-based whiting fishery is essential for the preservation of the social and
economic structure of the west coast fishing industry.

Social Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council believes that the proposed rule will provide the greatest stability to the harvesting and processing
communities. The Council is concerned about the impacts on traditional fishermen and the rural coastal communities
where they reside, focusing on those displaced by Americanization of the joint venture fisheries as well as those
displaced from other declining fisheries and industries. An integrated industry is important in dealing with severe
stock declines in other fisheries, most notably in the salmon industry, which also is stressing the shore-based processing
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the traditional whiting fishery must be viewed in the context of the overall groundfish fishery. Most
traditional whiting fishermen (those receiving ``A'' permits in the limited entry fishery) operate in other groundfish
fisheries as well. These fisheries have been managed under increasingly restrictive landing limits, and are harvested
near their levels of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), which means they cannot sustain additional effort. Of the three
options considered, Option 1 (the proposed rule) provides the greatest stability to the harvesting and processing
communities in part because it provides for the longest season for the shoreside sector (which could last until late
July/mid-October in 1994&hyph;1996) and should divert the greatest effort from other fully-utilized fisheries.
Diversion of effort from these other fisheries is intended to prolong their seasons, delay reductions in trip limits,
and maintain employment opportunities in both fishing and processing sectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, the catcher/processor trawl fleet entered the fishery off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1990
and has targeted only on whiting. Consequently, its participation in the whiting fishery does not divert effort from
other west coast fisheries, and, by taking the harvest guideline quickly, may reduce market opportunities for catcher
vessels that do not process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The no allocation option (Option 3) could encourage a brief fishery conducted primarily by at-sea processors, with
the entire harvest guideline being taken by the end of June. This would divert effort back to the other fully-utilized
groundfish fisheries, could accelerate the need for reduced trip limits in those fisheries, and result in shortened
seasons for the shoreside fishing and processing industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing opportunities for the at-sea fleet also have been substantially reduced, particularly off Alaska and the
former Soviet Union, and therefore whiting has become more important to this fleet as well. The Council concluded
that the social and demographic description included in the December 1992 EA/RIR (prepared for the 1993 allocation
decision) clearly showed that the relative importance of whiting to the coastal communities exceeds the relative
importance to the Seattle metropolitan area where most of the at-sea processing fleet is based (although a large percentage
of employees are recruited from throughout the western United States). The Council agrees that neither sector should
receive a disproportionate amount of the harvest guideline, as could occur under the no allocation option (Option
3). It also believes that the greater national benefit will be derived by giving some protection to the traditional
catcher vessels that deliver to shore-based processors, and the communities in which they are based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although each of these options would influence participation by each sector, none of the options would preempt any
sector entirely. The social impacts of Option 1 upon the Seattle-based at-sea processing fleet are small relative
to those already occurring under the limited entry program. Because the fleet composition under the limited entry
program is still relatively unknown, undertaking a rigorous social analysis is premature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also recommended Option 1 because industry consensus in support of this option indicated a willingness
to compromise that is unprecedented and should be encouraged.

Net Benefit to the Nation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the findings above, the Council found other compelling reasons to support the proposed rule and concluded
that it would provide the greatest net benefit to the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1 addresses concerns that there be equal sharing of the conservation burden between the at-sea and the shoreside
processing sectors. A percentage allocation more equitably shares between sectors both the conservation burden
when the harvest guideline is low, and the benefit when the harvest guideline is high. The harvest guideline in 1994
is much higher than previously expected, almost twice the 1993 level, but is expected to be lower in 1995 and 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the tonnage available in 1994 is substantially higher than in 1993, additional overcapitalization is
not expected. The shore-based industry already is developed and the 104,000 mt reserve is close to the 100,000 mt estimate
of shoreside capacity in the EA/RIR. (Maximum annual harvest by shore-based whiting fishery was estimated at 134,000
mt in 1994&hyph;1996.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, if implemented, would apply only for the next 3 years, a long-enough horizon for stability in planning,
but short enough to indicate to the public that the Council may reconsider this issue after the fleet has had a chance
to adjust to the limited entry program and whiting markets have stabilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is not a major departure from the approved 1993 allocation percentage of 30 percent for the shoreside
sector. The Council recommendation for 1994&hyph;1996 would give shoreside priority to 40 percent of the harvest
guideline, supplementing any amount taken during the olympic fishery for the first 60 percent. Also, with implementation
of the limited entry program, participation by the at-sea processing fleet may be much lower than in 1993, although
the exact level will not be known until the fishery occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reserve release assures that the harvest guideline will be fully utilized. The release date of August 15 is 2 weeks
earlier than in the past, and provides a longer opportunity for the at-sea fleet if a release is made to them. August
15 also coincides with the opening of the pollock ``B'' season in Alaska, and therefore would provide a more subdued
level of effort and a more orderly fishery than if the reserve were released much earlier or later in the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above considerations, NOAA also has considered the Council's response to the following three questions
asked at the November 1993 Council meeting: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Why is allocating between the sectors by regulation superior to allowing the market to determine the shares between
sectors? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of the sectors has the capacity to take a substantial portion, if not all, of the whiting harvest guideline in the
next 3 years. It is not clear if each would choose to do so given current low prices and uncertainty in the availability
of markets. The shore-based and at-sea sectors operate optimally at different rates, however, with the shore-based
component generally preferring a longer, slower fishery and the at-sea component best served with a relatively shorter,
more intense operation. Extended seasons at sea and on-shore actually enhance market opportunities for catcher
boats that would have their choice of markets. Furthermore, providing an opportunity for all sectors would divert
effort from other fully utilized fisheries that already are severely restricted. Additional effort into those fisheries
would have a cascading effect, causing earlier and/or more restrictive management measures and even greater stress
on shore-based processors of those species. (Whiting is the only trawl-caught species off Washington, Oregon, and
California that is processed offshore to any large extent.) Allowing the at-sea processing sector to even partially
preempt the shoreside sector would reduce national net benefits to the nation from the fishery and destabilize the
successfully developed shoreside economic infrastructure. Thus, there is ample justification to allocate between
sectors. The proposed rule would provide each sector with a reasonable opportunity to utilize this public resource.
However, if a sector does not need or intend to use its opportunity to the fullest extent possible, any unused portion
of the harvest guideline would be made available to the entire whiting fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Will this proposal encourage further capitalization in either sector? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of the options, including the preferred option, are expected to encourage further capitalization in either
sector. The at-sea and shore-based processing sectors and the catcher fleet are fully developed and are believed
to be capable of taking the proposed amounts. Even though the tonnage available in 1994 is substantially higher than
in 1993 (and is the highest level in the 3-year period under consideration), market prices for whiting currently are
at such low levels that it is unlikely that additional processing capacity would be attracted. At issue is the extent
that existing capacity will be utilized on whiting, other species, or not at all.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
With 104,000 mt reserved for shore-based operations in 1994, what are the net benefits to the nation from providing
an exclusive opportunity to the shoreside sector to use twice its historical level? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the Secretary was concerned that the conservation burden of a reduced harvest guideline be equitably shared
among the sectors. Similarly, the benefit of an increased harvest guideline also should be equitably shared between
the sectors, particularly since it is not expected to result in increased capitalization, but rather in how effectively
the existing infrastructure is used. Thus, it would not be reasonable to limit the shoreside sector to only what they
processed in 1993 or any prior year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shoreside industry needs a longer operating window to be viable than the at-sea sector needs. Production by early
August will be a key component in determining if shore-based processors will need the entire reserve. Any unneeded
portion of the harvest guideline will be made available to the entire fishery on or about August 15, assuring there
is adequate time to conduct successful operations on the remainder of the harvest guideline. In 1992 and 1993, the
at-sea fleet was able to harvest considerably more than its initial allocation due to the release of whiting not needed
by shoreside processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The historical level of catch or production is not the only consideration. In 1993, both the shore-based and at-sea
processing fleets were constrained from catching as much whiting as they wanted. The 40 percent reserve recognizes
anticipated lower participation by catcher/processors in 1994 and beyond, consistent with implementation of the
limited entry program in January 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has reviewed the Council's recommendation and supporting analysis and initially has determined that the proposed
rule is consistent with the Magnuson Act and its national standards and other applicable Federal laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA also requests comments on the advisability of releasing additional amounts of whiting after August 15, but only
if necessary to ensure full utilization of the harvest guideline.

 and was prepared at the request of the Pacific Fishery Management Council. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has initially determined that this proposed rule is necessary for management of
the Pacific coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this proposed rule (contained in the EA/RIR), and concluded
that there would be no significant impact on the environment. A copy of the EA may be obtained from the Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the whiting fleet contains less than 20 percent of the total number of groundfish vessels, if this proposed
rule diverts effort from other traditional groundfish stocks, more than 20 percent of the fleet could potentially
be affected. However, none of the options is expected to have impacts that would qualify under any of the criteria for
determining ``significant'' impacts, nor would they force any small business entity to cease operation. In fact,
in comparison to the status quo, the proposed rule could result in greater fishing opportunities for non-whiting
vessels and thus increased revenues. For these reasons, it is determined that the proposed rule potentially would
affect a substantial number of small entities, but would not cause significant economic impacts on those entities.
Therefore, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) is not required. Also, the Council has requested that
this notice announce a correction to page 77 of the EA/RIR, the last sentence in the first paragraph, so that it reads:
``The Council concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant effects on small entities
in 1994&hyph;1996.''

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the
Western Pacific Region (FMP). This rule would replace a moratorium on the issuance of new permits for the Hawaii-based
longline fishery for Pacific pelagic management unit species. Under this rule, limited entry permits for the Hawaii
longline fishery would be issued to people meeting certain eligibility criteria. The rule also proposes broad framework
procedures for subsequent adjustment of the conservation and management measures for the pelagics fisheries intended
to provide for more efficient administration of the longline fishery. This rule also makes several technical changes
to the regulations. The proposed action is necessary to manage the longline fishery based in Hawaii to achieve optimum
yield from the fishery and prevent overfishing in accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act). Comments are solicited on this action; especially regarding the sufficiency of the upgrade limit
to control the longline fleet's growth and the adequacy of this measure to protect pelagic stocks and to prevent adverse
impacts on non-longline fishermen fishing for tuna and billfish, and to protect sea turtles.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FMP was prepared by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented by
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) at a time when there were few problems in the domestic fisheries for management
unit species (billfish and associated species). This is no longer the case. The longline fishery based in Hawaii targets
swordfish, tuna, and other management unit species, with vessels often traveling up to 2,000 miles (3,219 Km) from
port. Due to rapid growth of this fishery, prior to imposition of the 3-year moratorium on new participants, there
was concern about the potential and actual impact of the expanded fishery on the status of some fish stocks, the impact
of increased longline catches on other fisheries, and interactions between longline fishing and protected species
such as Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council and Secretary have already taken several actions to address these concerns. They established a control
date for possible use in a limited entry program (56 FR 12891, March 28, 1991), issued an emergency rule establishing
a moratorium on new entry into the Hawaii-based longline fishery (56 FR 14866, April 12, 1991) and subsequently extended
the moratorium to midnight, April 22, 1994, by Amendment 4 to the FMP (56 FR 51849, October 16, 1991). Amendment 7 would
replace the moratorium and addresses a number of issues that are associated with the prospect of unregulated expansion
of the longline fishery. Increased level of longline fishing catches from the portion of the EEZ around Hawaii and
from adjacent high seas could result in overfishing of the stocks of Pacific pelagic management unit species throughout
their range, most notably swordfish. Even if stocks were not affected on a stock-wide basis, increased catches by
U.S. longline vessels could adversely affect other established fisheries, such as the commercial and recreational
handline and troll fisheries in the EEZ, as well as within the longline fishery. Further, even if direct catch competition
were not occurring, there would be considerable potential for market competition, both between the longline fleet
and the troll and handline fleets and within the longline fishery itself. Unregulated expansion of the longline fishery
could also increase the likelihood of adverse impacts on threatened and endangered species such as sea turtles, which
are known to be taken in the longline fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the restrictions (e.g., limitations on permit transfers and on vessel upgrading) under the moratorium,
in combination with area closures around the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands, which were imposed after the
moratorium went into effect, have been adversely affecting a number of people who had qualified for longline permits
under the moratorium. More than a quarter of the eligible fleet was inactive in 1992, due in many cases to the main Hawaiian
Island area closures that require vessels to travel 50 to 75 (81 to 121 Km) or more miles from shore to set their longline
gear. Some older and smaller vessels are unable to fish under these restrictions. Vessel owners have in some cases
been unable to sell or otherwise transfer their vessels or obtain financing for their fishing activity due to the ``one
transfer'' limit during the moratorium. In the Council's view, this has been an unintended negative effect of the
management program. Further, restrictions on the longline fishery outside the EEZ could have mixed effects on the
nation. The United States would benefit if the fishery could expand without adverse effects on fish stocks, other
fisheries, or protected resources and if foreign fleets were subject to similar restrictions. However, in the absence
of similar management of foreign fleets, restricting the U.S. fleet could disadvantage the United States in any future
negotiations leading to international regulation of longline fisheries and allocations of fish from the high seas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Amendment 7 is intended to improve the administration of the existing longline fishery management program.
The FMP also could be improved administratively. Existing framework procedures for regulatory changes are limited
in scope, and new framework procedures are proposed to simplify and expedite the implementation of new regulations
in particular instances without an FMP amendment. This is especially important for rapid response to new information
indicating problems with respect to stock conservation or conservation of protected resources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hawaii longline limited entry permits would be required for longline vessels used to: (1) Fish for pelagic species
in the EEZ around Hawaii; or (2) land or transship pelagic species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ around
Hawaii. The permits already required by existing regulations at 50 CFR 685.9 would be re-named ``longline general
permits'' and would be required for longline vessels around American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands or
other U.S. possessions in the Pacific Ocean, that are used to fish for, land, or transship pelagic species. Holders
of Hawaii longline limited entry permits would not need a separate general permit to longline, land, or transship
anywhere in the fishery management area (the waters off Hawaii and all the western Pacific territories and possessions),
or adjacent state waters. Receiving vessel permits would be required for vessels shoreward of the outer boundary
of the fishery management area that do not have longline gear on board and that land pelagic species or receive pelagic
species from other vessels. For purposes of 50 CFR part 685, ``land'' means to begin to offload, to arrive in port with
the intention of offloading, or to cause to be offloaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following persons would be eligible for Hawaii longline limited entry permits: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The last holder of record for any longline vessel limited entry permit under the moratorium, provided the vessel
was used to land longline-caught management unit species in Hawaii at least once during the moratorium period; (2)
The last holder of record of a limited entry permit under the moratorium for a vessel less than 40 feet (12 m) in length;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The last holder of record of a limited entry permit obtained during the moratorium because that person also held
a limited entry permit for the NWHI crustaceans (lobster) fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 166 vessels are expected to qualify for permits under this program. Hawaii longline limited entry
permits would be freely transferable between vessel owners, provided the new vessel is not longer than the longest
vessel that had a longline limited entry permit and made landings during the moratorium period (about 93 feet (28 m)
to date). The vessel's length overall is defined in the proposed regulations and will be the measure of length used
in implementing this restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures are intended to allow vessel owners more freedom to either transfer their vessels or permits to other
prospective fishery participants or invest in larger vessels (up to the size of the largest vessel active in the moratorium
period) in order to resume operation in the fishery. Vessel owners would have more freedom to decide whether and how
to use their vessels and other resources. This is expected to result in a decrease in the number of smaller vessels and
an increase in the number of larger vessels. Overall effort is expected to increase over the actual effort that occurred
during the moratorium, with more effort directed at swordfish on the high seas. Landings of swordfish and tuna are
expected to increase, with the value of landings estimated to rise from about $45 million in 1992 to about $60 million
per year after fleet adjustments have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment contains framework procedures to allow rapid responses to changing conditions, including biological
concerns for the stocks, economic problems in the fisheries, and potential harm to protected species under the Endangered
Species Act, such as sea turtles. This would simplify the implementation of needed changes in the management program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-permitted U.S. longline vessels could enter the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Council's area of concern
and ports shoreward of the EEZ with longline-caught fish on board provided the longline gear is stowed or secured.
These vessels would not be allowed to offload management unit species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ. These
measures are intended to relieve economic strains now faced by longline vessel owners in Hawaii due to present limitations
on permit transfers and vessel upgrades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 685.23 would be removed because the 5-year review was completed in 1992 and this section is therefore no longer
applicable. It was noted that pelagic fisheries had changed dramatically and that more frequent evaluation of the
effectiveness of management was necessary. Several amendments to the FMP already had been implemented to address
new issues. The Council now prepares an annual report on this fishery under the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also proposes to add three fish species to the management unit (moonfish, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lamprus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spp.; pomfret, Family Bramidae; and oilfish, Family Gempylidae). The definition of overfishing applied to other
Pacific Pelagic Management Unit Species (excluding sharks) would apply to the species added to the management unit.
This would ensure that collection of catch and effort data will be comprehensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the definition of protected species zone would be revised to correct a drafting error when the zone was
created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 52214, October 18, 1991). The current definition leaves open to longline fishing a corridor between Laysan
Island and Lisianski Island. The intent of the Council in establishing the protected species zone was to provide a
continuous closed corridor around the NWHI in which longline fishing would be prohibited to protect Hawaiian monk
seals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would eliminate &sect;685.26, which has procedures for changing longline fishing prohibited areas, because
the new framework procedures in &sect;685.18 would encompass the procedures for changing longline fishing prohibited
areas.

A consultation was conducted by NMFS under the Endangered Species Act in 1993 to determine if the fishery, as it was
being managed under the FMP at that time, would jeopardize the continued existence of sea turtles. A Biological Opinion
and Incidental Take Statement were issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 10, 1993, that indicated the fishery is not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species of
sea turtle, nor will it adversely affect any critical habitat of any listed sea turtle species during the 1-year term
of the Opinion. An incidental take of 752 turtles was established. Several conservation recommendations and reasonable
and prudent measures were included in the Opinion and Statement, which are in an Appendix to this Amendment 7. Through
complementary actions, the Council has also concurred with establishment of a mandatory observer program and an
electronic vessel monitoring system requirement for the longline fishery. These measures were included in the Opinion
and Statement. The proposed amendment will be evaluated for compliance with the Biological Opinion during the public
review process for Amendment 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservation of sea turtles is a special concern. In the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, NMFS
included a conservation recommendation that the FMP be amended to preclude increases in longline effort until it
is demonstrated that the take of turtles is being managed at a level that will not preclude recovery of the species.
Amendment 7 would establish a cap on potential harvesting capacity by allowing vessel upgrades only to the size of
the largest vessel active in the moratorium period. The amendment indicates that it is likely there will be some shift
to larger vessels on average, and that larger vessels generally deploy fewer hooks per set than small vessels. Effort
is not expected to increase above that which would have occurred if all the vessels in the fleet had been active in the
moratorium. As noted, the amendment also proposes framework measures to allow rapid regulatory response to new information,
including indications of need for management changes for protected resources. In separate actions, the Council
has concurred with establishment of a mandatory observer program and a vessel monitoring system requirement. In
the Council's view, these measures taken together are sufficient to control growth of the longline fishery and address
future conservation problems with new actions, if necessary, and the amendment complies with the Biological Opinion
and incidental take statement. NMFS specifically solicits comments on this issue.

Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by a Council within
15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined that Amendment
7 is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. In making
that determination, the Secretary will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is not subject to review under E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council prepared a combined draft FMP amendment/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) covering the impacts
of the fishery as managed under this amendment and alternative approaches. The final amendment/final EIS satisfies
NEPA requirements for documentation and analysis of the impacts of the fishery on the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was conducted in 1993 and NMFS issued a Biological
Opinion (Opinion) and Incidental Take Statement (Statement) in June 1993 concerning the take of sea turtles in the
longline fishery. The Opinion concluded that the fishery, as managed by the FMP at that time, is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of the species during the one-year period of the Opinion. An incidental take of 752 turtles
was set for the one year during which the Opinion is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, if adopted, is expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Hawaii longline vessel owners (approximately 166) will have more flexibility to buy and sell vessels and permits
and to upgrade their fishing vessels to compete more effectively in the domestic longline fishery, as well as with
foreign fleets. It is estimated that total revenue from longline landings would increase to $60 million per year from
about $45 million in 1992. The final amendment/FEIS also is written to serve as an IRFA intended to satisfy the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule includes changes in an information collection previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OMB No. 0648&hyph;0204). A request for approval of these modifications and extension of the collections is included
in a request submitted by the Southwest Region, NMFS, for approval of modification and extension of that collection
that covers all Southwest Region fishery permit programs. The proposed program would require prospective participants
in the Hawaii longline fishery to submit permit application forms and supporting information, including a current
Certificate of Documentation from the U.S. Coast Guard, to obtain a permit under the new limited entry program. Landings
records from the existing Hawaii longline logbook reporting requirement will be used to determine whether an individual
has met any landings requirement to qualify for a permit. The estimated burden on the applicants is 30 minutes per application.
This is less than the average of 1 hour or more that had been required for applications for permits in the moratorium
period because those applications often involved documentation demonstrating intent to enter the longline fishery
at a time when investment decisions were made. The documentation requirements under the new permit program will be
simpler. This rule also restates requirements for the submission of logbooks and post-landing notifications. These
requirements have already been approved by OMB under Control Number 0648&hyph;0214. The response times for these
requirements were estimated to be 5 minutes per day for the logbook and 5 minutes per notification. Send comments regarding
these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collection-of-information requirements, including suggestions
for reducing burden, to the Director of the Southwest Region, NMFS, and to OMB (see

Introduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New management measures may be added, through rulemaking, if new information demonstrates that there are biological,
social, or economic concerns in the fishery. The following framework process allows for measures that may affect
operation of the fisheries, gear restrictions, quotas, or reductions or increases in longline catch and/or effort
if the information supports such a change. Additional information may indicate the need for new management measures
for other sectors of the fishery, such as harvest guidelines, permits for certain classes of vessels, or reporting
requirements.

Assessment of the fisheries.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed Pelagics Plan Team will prepare an annual report on fisheries in the
fishery management area, containing the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fishery performance data (e.g., landings, effort, value of landings, species composition); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Summary of recent research and survey results; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Habitat conditions and recent alterations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Enforcement activities and problems; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Administrative action (e.g., data collection and reporting, permits); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) State and territorial management actions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Assessment of need for Council action (including biological, economic, social, enforcement, administrative,
and state/Federal needs, problems, and trends). Indications of potential problems warranting further investigation
may be signaled by indicator criteria. These criteria could include, but are not limited to, important changes in:
Mean size of the catch of any species; estimated ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality for any species; decline
in catch per unit effort by any sector; ex-vessel revenue of any sector; relative proportions of gear in and around
the EEZ; rate of entry/exit of fishermen in the fisheries; revenues for a significant percentage of any sector; total
pelagic landings; species composition of the pelagic landings; research results; habitat or environmental conditions;
or level of interactions between pelagic fishing operations and protected species in the EEZ or surrounding waters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Recommendations for Council action; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recommendations for management action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual report shall specify any recommendations made by the Pelagics Plan Team to the Council. Recommendations
may cover actions suggested for Federal regulations, state/territorial action, enforcement or administrative
elements, and research and data collection. Recommendations will include an assessment of urgency and the effects
of not taking action and will indicate whether changes involve existing measures, which may be changed under paragraph
(c) of this section, or new measures, which may be implemented under paragraph (d) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for changing established measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Established measures are those that are or have been in place via rulemaking procedures for various sectors of
the fisheries, including, but not limited to: General longline fishery permits; limited entry longline fishery
permits; longline logbooks and other reporting requirements; longline area closures; and longline gear marking
requirements. The estimated and potential impacts of these measures have been evaluated in past FMP amendments and
associated documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Council will identify problems that may warrant action. This may be through the annual report described in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or a separate report from the Pelagics Plan Team, the Advisory Subpanel, Pelagics
Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, pelagic fishery sector, enforcement officials, NMFS or other
sources. The Council will discuss at its next meeting whether changes to established conservation and management
measures would resolve the problem. Notice to the public and news media preceding the meeting will indicate that the
Council intends to discuss and possibly recommend regulatory adjustments through the framework process for established
measures to address the issue or problem. The notice must summarize the issue(s) and the basis for recommending the
measures being reviewed and would refer interested parties to the document(s) pertaining to the issue. Based on the
discussions at the meeting, which could include participation by the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Subpanel, Pelagics
Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, or other Council organizations, the Council will decide whether
to recommend action by the Regional Director. The Regional Director will be asked to indicate any special concerns
or objections to the possible actions being considered under the framework process and, if there are any concerns
or objections, will be asked for ways to resolve them.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) If the Council decides to proceed, a document will be prepared describing the problem and the proposed regulatory
adjustment to resolve it. The document will demonstrate how the adjustment is consistent with the purposes of the
established measure and that the impacts had been addressed in the document supporting the original imposition of
the measure. The document will be submitted to the Regional Director with a recommendation for action. The Council
may indicate its intent that the recommendations are to be approved or disapproved as a single action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Regional Director approves part or all of the Council's recommendation, the Secretary, in accordance with
the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved change in an established measure by publishing a final
rule, waiving advance notice and comment. This does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional
opportunity for advance notice and comment, but contemplates that the Council process will satisfy the requirements
of the Magnuson Act and Administrative Procedure Act. It is emphasized that established measures are measures that
have been evaluated and applied in the past, and adjustments are meant to be consistent with the original intent of
the measure and within the scope of analysis in previous documents supporting the existing measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(e) of
the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for implementing new measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) New measures are those that have not been used before or measures that, while previously applied, would be applied
to another fishing sector (e.g., non-longline pelagic fishery) or gear type for the first time. New measures may have
been previously considered in a past FMP amendment or document, but the specific impacts on the persons to whom the
measures would newly apply have not been evaluated in the context of current conditions. Potential new measures include,
but are not limited to: Permit requirements for new fishery sectors; reporting requirements for a fishery sector
other than longline fishing; effort limitations; quotas (for total catch or by species) including individual transferable
quotas; fractional licensing; or bycatch limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A Pelagics Plan Team report (annual report or an in-season report), input from advisors, or input from NMFS or other
agencies will first bring attention to a problem or issue that needs to be addressed at the next Council meeting. In
its notice announcing the meeting, the Council will summarize the concern or issue raised, the party that has raised
the problem, and the extent to which it is a new problem or a problem that may require new management measures. The Council
will seek to identify all interested persons and organizations and solicit their involvement in discussion and resolution
of this problem through the Council process, and the Council meeting notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will emphasize that this problem will be discussed and that proposed actions may result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The document presenting the problem to the attention of the Council will be distributed to all advisory bodies
of the Council who have not yet received it, with a request for comments. The document also will be distributed to the
Council's mailing list associated with the FMP to solicit inputs and to indicate the Council will take up action at
the following meeting. The Council's chairperson may request the Council's Pelagics Standing Committee to discuss
the issue and review the comments (if any) of the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Panel, Pelagics Review Board, or Scientific
and Statistical Committee, and develop recommendations for Council action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) At the meeting, the Council will consider the recommendations of its Pelagics Standing Committee, if any, and
other Council organizations and will take comments from the public concerning the possible course of action. If the
Council agrees to proceed with further action under the framework process, the issue will be placed on the agenda for
the following meeting. A document describing the issue, alternative ways to resolve the issue, the preferred action,
and the anticipated impacts of the preferred action, will be prepared and distributed to the public with a request
for comments. A notice will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 summarizing the Council's deliberations and preferred action and indicating the time and place for the Council meeting
to take final action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In its notice for the following meeting, the Council will indicate that the Council may take final action on the
possible adjustment to regulations under this section. At the meeting, the Council will consider the comments received
as a result of its solicitation of comments and take public comments during the meeting on the issue or problem. The
Council will consider any new information presented or collected and analyzed during the comment period. The Regional
Director will be provided a specific opportunity to indicate any objections or concerns about any or all components
of the measures being considered. The Council then will decide whether to propose a new measure or measures under this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the Council decides to proceed, the Council will submit its proposal to the Regional Director for consideration
with supporting rationale and an analysis of the estimated biological, economic and social impacts of the proposed
actions. The Council may indicate its intent that all components of its recommendations be approved or disapproved
as a single action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Regional Director concurs in whole or in part, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act, may implement the approved new measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. Nothing
in this procedure is intended to preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance
notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but contemplates that the Council process (which includes two Council meetings with opportunity for public comment
at each) will satisfy that requirement.
