SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This hearing is being held to consider proposals to amend the Middle Atlantic milk marketing order. The proposals
would amend provisions dealing with pooling qualifications for distributing plants and cooperative reserve processing
plants, producer milk diverted to nonpool plants, and the qualification of pool plants under more than one Federal
order. Two of the proposals would authorize the market administrator to adjust pool plant qualification standards
and producer milk diversion limits to reflect changes in marketing conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Holiday Inn-Independence Mall, 400 Arch Street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19106, telephone (215) 923&hyph;8660, beginning at 9 a.m. on May 3, 1994, with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreement and to the order regulating the handling of milk in the aforesaid marketing area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreement and to the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions under the Federal milk order program are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and information requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;608c(15)(A)
of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision
of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting
a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the
petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction
in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days
after date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 6 copies
of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of
other participants at the hearing.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule will not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Have any retroactive effect; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The REA telephone program provides loans to REA borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than
those generally available from the private sector. REA borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive
economic benefits which exceed any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements.
Moreover, this action liberalizes certain contract requirements by changing contract limits and allowing negotiation
of fee schedules which further offsets economic costs.

REA has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined
by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules are primarily aimed at further clarifying and relaxing existing REA regulations concerning post-loan
and system construction policies and procedures. Further clarification of REA policy would ease borrower reporting
requirements by clearly defining certain post-loan construction procedures, such as contract construction and
closeout procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part 1744, subpart B is revised to explain what REA means by ``in the interests of the Government''. Also, definitions
sections of subpart B and subpart C are combined into a single list of definitions, located in subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part 1753, subpart B is revised to delete definitions which merely repeat those in subpart A. Also, a monthly construction
progress reporting requirement is deleted because it contains information reported elsewhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subparts F and I are revised to increase the maximum allowable dollar amount of the Form 773 contract. This requires
miscellaneous revisions throughout part 1753. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor and technical corrections are made throughout part 1753. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendices A through F are revised to change the requirement to distribute certain documents to REA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Appendix A is amended by adding to the table the distribution of Seismic Safety Certifications, required
by 7 CFR part 1792, to the contractor and REA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B is amended by removing from the table the distribution of the Switching Diagram and Set of Drawings to REA,
and to delete reference to REA Form 744 which has been replaced by REA Form 754. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix C is amended by removing from the table the distribution of Final Key Maps and Final Central Office Area and
Town Detail Maps to REA, and to reduce to one copy the number of other final documents required for REA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D is amended to comply with the revisions proposed to Appendix C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix E is amended by removing from the table the distribution of Detail Maps and Key Maps to REA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix F is amended by adding to the table the distribution of REA Form 213, Buy American Certificate to REA.

(c) The two contract forms which may be used for major outside plant construction are Form 515 and Form 773. Limitations
on the applicability of these forms shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Form 515 shall be used for major outside plant construction projects which will be competitively bid. The contract
contains plans and specifications and has no dollar limitation. See &sect;&sect;1753.47, 1753.48 and 1753.49.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A Form 515 contract which is for less than $200,000, may, at the borrower's option, be negotiated. See &sect;1753.48(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Form 773 shall be used for major outside plant projects which may not be competitively bid, and which cannot be designed
and staked at the time of contract execution. Projects of this nature include routine line extensions and placement
of subscriber drops. The Form 773 contract is limited to a maximum of $200,000. REA will not finance more than $400,000
in Form 773 contracts for a borrower in any twelve month period. This $400,000 limitation includes all major and minor
construction performed under Form 773 contracts, and is determined by the date the Form 773 contract is executed.

Currently federally insured credit unions that wish to maintain public unit and nonmember accounts in excess of 20
percent of their total shares must have a waiver request approved by the Regional Director. The waiver request must
include a plan setting forth the intended sources and uses of the funds. The proposed amendments would change the amount
of nonmember and public unit accounts that a credit union may maintain, without a waiver, to 20 percent of total shares
or $1.5 million, whichever is greater. Credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total
shares but not greater than $1.5 million would, as under the current rule, be required to develop a written plan and
send it to the Regional Director. Prior NCUA approval, however, would no longer be required.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCUA Board, as part of its ongoing program of regulatory review, proposes to revise the regulation under which
federally insured credit unions maintain nonmember and public unit accounts. Federal credit unions (FCUs) are authorized
by section 107(6) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757(6)) to receive nonmember shares from other credit
unions, from certain governmental entities (``public units'') and, if the credit union has a ``low-income'' designation
from NCUA, from other outside sources. These nonmember shares, and equivalent accounts authorized for federally
insured state credit unions under the state law are defined by section 101(5) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1752(5)) as ``accounts''
and ``member accounts'' for purposes of the various provisions of the FCU Act, including those establishing insurance
coverage by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCUA's current regulation on nonmember accounts requires any federally-insured credit union that wishes to accept
nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares to submit to NCUA a plan setting forth the intended use of
the funds and obtain NCUA approval. This rule was imposed in December 1988 (53 FR 50918, 12/19/88) in response to mismanagement
and misuse of nonmember accounts by some credit unions. Pursuant to &sect;741.6 of NCUA's Regulations, federally-insured
state chartered credit unions must adhere to NCUA's requirements regarding nonmember accounts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most credit unions, the only forms of nonmember accounts are public unit and credit union accounts. However, as
described above, credit unions with a low-income designation from NCUA are authorized to accept nonmember accounts
from any source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the current nonmember account rule was instituted, NCUA's concern with these accounts stemmed from abuses involving
large sums of money, often in excess of the $100,000 limit. In order to attract and retain these accounts, some credit
unions paid higher than market dividend rates. Large influxes of funds into credit unions caused asset/liability
management problems that were often not within management's expertise to control. In some cases, the total amount
of such account was far in excess of the amount necessary to meet the legitimate needs of the members and was used to fund
high risk loans and questionable investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The imposition of the 20 percent limitation has virtually eliminated problems involving nonmember funds. As discussed
more fully below, however, the process of requesting waivers, which has fallen almost entirely on low-income credit
unions, has proven burdensome for some credit unions. The purpose of this proposal is to reduce that burden without
significantly increasingly the risk to the credit union system and the NCUSIF.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As of June 1993, only 57 low-income credit unions out of 146 maintained nonmember accounts. The total dollar amount
of these accounts was approximately nineteen million, with the average dollar amount per low-income credit union
approximately $339,000. Surveys indicate that low-income credit unions maintaining nonmember accounts are currently
paying below market rates on the vast majority of these funds. It appears that most low-income credit unions, as most
other credit unions, use nonmember accounts prudently and do not maintain excessive amounts of these funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCUA recognizes that nonmember accounts can be crucial to a low-income credit union in meeting the fundamental purpose
of a credit union: Promoting thrift and creating a source of credit for its members. Nonmember funds can be invested
to provide earnings that are paid out to members in the form of dividends, and they can provide a source of much needed
loan funds. Moreover, nonmember accounts can generate income that can be a source of badly needed capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the period from the adoption of the regulation in 1988 through June 1993, 50 of 59 waiver requests (85%) have been
approved. This suggests that most waiver requests have been justified and acceptable to the regional director. Although
a high percentage of the waivers have been approved, the procedure has proven burdensome for some credit unions. Given
the small asset size of most credit unions, the 20 percent limit frequently requires waivers for small amounts of funds
that pose very little risk to the credit union and the NCUSIF. Both credit unions and NCUA may be expending much more
time and paperwork on waiver requests than safety and soundness requires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the NCUA Board remains concerned with the potential misuse of nonmember accounts, the Board believes that
a modification of the 20 percent limit may be justified. The Board is proposing the following changes to the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that a credit union be able to maintain permissible nonmember accounts up to 20 percent of total shares
or $1.5 million, whichever is greater, before a waiver by the regional director is required. This change recognizes
the benefit of a limitation on nonmember accounts but also allows a credit union to maintain a reasonable amount of
nonmember accounts, up to $1.5 million, without requesting one or more waivers from the regional director.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As under the current rule, all credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares would
be required to have a plan for the use of such deposits. Further, the plan would be submitted to the Regional Director
for information. Prior NCUA approval would be required, however, only for amounts in excess of both 20% and $1.5 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan would describe how nonmember accounts will be used to serve the credit union's membership, i.e., by providing
loanable funds to its members or through increased earnings. This requirement should ensure that federally-insured
credit unions have a reasonable plan in place for the use of the funds. As under the current rule, the plan would provide
for matching maturities of nonmember accounts with corresponding assets, or a justification for any mismatch; and
provide for an adequate income spread between public unit and nonmember shares and corresponding assets. The credit
union would submit the plan to the regional director, prior to receiving nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent,
for NCUA's information and monitoring. NCUA approval would not be required before the credit union accepts additional
nonmember accounts, unless the aggregate amount exceeded both 20% of shares and $1.5 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments, if adopted, would allow small credit unions to receive significant amounts of nonmember
shares, in relation to their total shares, without the prior NCUA approval that has been required since 1988. The Board
is committed to working with these credit unions to ensure that nonmember funds are used in a safe and sound manner to
benefit their membership. In this connection, the Board requests comment on whether periodic reporting on the sources
and uses of nonmember shares, in excess of 20 percent of total shares, should be established. The Board may consider
a monthly or quarterly reporting requirement or alternatively, revisions to the NCUA Call Report (NCUA Form 5300),
to gather additional information on sources and uses of nonmember funds.

C. Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also requests comment on a related issue; the length of an approved waiver, in those cases where a waiver request
and approval are still required. The regulation currently states in &sect;701.32(b)(2) that the waiver request
will normally be for a two-year period. Although the Board believes this language provides the regional director
with sufficient discretion to approve waivers for a shorter or longer period, the Board is requesting comment on whether
a nondiscretionary time period for the waiver should be stated, possibly three years, or whether the waiver should
be open-ended and only terminated upon action by the regional director or the credit union.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact
a proposed regulation may have on a substantial number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in
assets). The revised rule is generally less restrictive than the current regulation. Overall, the NCUA Board expects
the change to benefit credit unions by permitting them to maintain a larger amount of nonmember accounts before requesting
a waiver from the Regional Director. Accordingly, the Board determines and certifies that this final rule does not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions and that a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis is not required.

Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The amendment applies
to federally-insured state-chartered credit unions that accept public unit and nonmember accounts. The proposed
rule would make it possible for a federally-insured credit union to accept a larger amount of nonmember deposits without
requesting an exemption.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Boeing Model 747&hyph;400
series airplanes. This proposal would require various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control
and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found. This proposal is prompted by an investigation to
determine the controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-flight thrust reverser deployment, which has revealed that, in the event of thrust reverser deployment during
high-speed climb or during cruise, these airplanes could experience control problems. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe features of the thrust reverser system by preventing
possible failure modes in the thrust reverser control system that can result in inadvertent deployment of a thrust
reverser during flight.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In May 1991, a Boeing Model 767 series airplane was involved in an accident in which a thrust reverser deployed inadvertently
during flight. While the investigation of the accident has not revealed the cause of that deployment, it has identified
a number of possible failure modes in the thrust reverser control system. Inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser
during flight could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA and the aviation industry are conducting an in-depth investigation of the thrust reverser systems installed
on various types of large transport airplanes. In particular, this investigation has focused on airplane controllability
in the event of an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser, and thrust reverser reliability in general. Based on
the data gathered from this ongoing investigation, the FAA has issued several airworthiness directives (AD) to require
periodic inspections and tests of the thrust reverser systems on certain Boeing Model 757 and 767 series airplanes
[for example, reference AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;8043 (56 FR 46725, September 16, 1991) for certain
Model 757 series airplanes; and AD 92&hyph;24&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8408 (57 FR 53258, November 9, 1992) for
certain Model 767 series airplanes]. In addition, the FAA has issued or proposed several AD's to require an additional
locking device on thrust reversers that are installed on Model 737&hyph;300/&hyph;400/&hyph;500, 757, and 767
series airplanes. This action was taken to enhance the level of reliability on airplane models that were determined
to have unacceptable flight characteristics following an in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Until now, the investigation of thrust reverser system reliability on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes has not been
given as high a priority as the other Boeing models because Model 747 series airplanes have never experienced control
problems as a result of an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. In fact, previously there had been at least 29 incidents
in which the thrust reverser installed on Model 747 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D series engines
deployed during flight and the airplane was still controllable. Based on this long safety record and the available
evidence up to this time, it has been accepted generally that all Model 747 series airplanes would be shown to be controllable
throughout the flight envelope following an in-flight thrust reverser deployment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently, however, Boeing has responded to an FAA request for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation to determine the controllability of Model 747 series airplanes following an in-flight thrust reverser
deployment. The investigation results thus far indicate that Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes could experience
certain control problems in the event of a thrust reverser deployment occurring during high speed climb or during
cruise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this new information, the FAA has determined that certain inspections and functional tests of the thrust
reverser control and indication system on Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes, similar to those required previously
for Model 757 and 767 series airplanes, are necessary as precautionary actions to provide an acceptable level of safety
for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes. Accomplishment of these inspections and functional tests is intended
to reduce the exposure of the airplane to potential undetected single failures in the thrust reverser control system.
The presence of an undetected failure in the thrust reverser control system, in some cases, can increase the likelihood
of an uncommanded thrust reverser deployment in the event of an additional thrust reverser control system failure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment of the thrust reverser system reliability of Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, SP, and SR
series airplanes is continuing. The FAA may consider rulemaking action for those airplanes based upon the results
of that assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletins 747&hyph;78&hyph;2112, dated November 11, 1993 (for
Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 series engines); 747&hyph;78&hyph;2113,
dated November 11, 1993 (for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 series
engines); and 747&hyph;78&hyph;2115, dated October 28, 1993 (for Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered
by Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G/H series engines). These service bulletins describe procedures for various inspections
and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require various inspections and functional tests of the thrust reverser control and
indication system, and correction of any discrepancy found. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed AD also would require that operators submit a report of initial inspection and test results to the FAA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified for these airplanes, at which time the FAA
may consider further rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 286 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 39 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 series engines of
U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to
accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney
PW4000 series engines is estimated to be $102,960, or $2,640 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, there are no Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 series engines on the U.S. Register. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and
placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately 60 work hours to accomplish the proposed
actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would
be $3,300 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, there are no Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;524G/H series
engines on the U.S. Register at this time. However, should one of these airplanes be imported and placed on the U.S.
Register in the future, it would require approximately 30 hours to accomplish the proposed actions, at an average
labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $1,650 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect cracking of certain fuselage longitudinal
lap joints, repair of any cracking found, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in those laps joints with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protruding head fasteners. This proposal is prompted by a structural reassessment of Model 747 series airplanes.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent skin cracking in the longitudinal lap joints of certain
stringers, which can lead to rapid decompression of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, manufacturer of Model 747 series airplanes, conducted a structural
reassessment of these airplanes. The FAA has reviewed the results of this reassessment and has determined that the
longitudinal lap joints of Stringer (S&hyph;)12 are critical to the structural integrity of these airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The upper skin in the S&hyph;12 longitudinal lap joints are made of waffle doublers that are hot bonded to skin panels.
The S&hyph;12 longitudinal lap joints have three rows of countersunk fasteners. The depth of the countersink exceeds
the thickness of the skin panel. If the waffle doubler disbonds from the skin panel, the resultant sharp edges at the
longitudinal lap joint fasteners can cause fatigue cracking at the fastener holes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Skin cracking in the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R, if not detected and corrected, could result
in rapid decompression of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2366, dated August 6, 1992, that describes
procedures for repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking of the skin around the
fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station
741.1, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in these longitudinal lap joints with protruding head fasteners.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive external HFEC inspections to detect cracking of the skin around
the fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station
741.1, and replacement of the countersunk fasteners in these longitudinal lap joints with protruding head fasteners.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This
proposal also would require repair of all cracking in accordance with procedures specified in the 747 Structural
Repair Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal is applicable only to airplanes having line numbers 201 through 230. Since the tolerance specifications
for the bonding process for airplanes manufactered after line number 230 were more stringent, those airplanes are
not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 30 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 17 work hours
per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $11,220, or $935
per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 302 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed requirement
to replace fasteners, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed requirement to replace fasteners on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $199,320, or $16,610 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures, above, the total cost impact of the proposed actions (cost of inspections added to the cost of
replacement of fasteners) on U.S. operators is estimated to be $210,540, or $17,545 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed replacement of fasteners would require a large number of work hours to accomplish.
However, the 4-year compliance time specified in paragraph (b) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the
replacement of the fasteners to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance
activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the stall protection system (SPS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input wiring, a revision to the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modification of the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS). This proposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted by a report that the AHRS could send conflicting input to the stall protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer (SPC) on the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent the loss of stall warning protection on the airplanes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Canadair Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 series airplanes. Transport Canada advises that the attitude and heading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference system (AHRS) could send conflicting input to the stall protection computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SPC) on these airplanes. When the AHRS sends input to the SPC, the left- and right-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand channels on the SPC receive and compare that input. The SPC has a built-in feature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that compares lateral acceleration from these channels. When the SPC recognizes unequal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lateral acceleration signals of 0.03g or higher, it will inhibit the stall horn, light, and stick 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
push command, and an ``SPS FAILURE'' caution message will display on the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight display. Due to a build-up effect of AHRS tolerances, these unequal signals may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected within the SPC at a roll rate within the normal flight envelope. This condition, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not corrected, could result in the loss of stall warning protection on the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bombardier, Inc., has issued Regional Jet Canadair Alert Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S.B. A601R&hyph;34&hyph;028, Revision `A,' dated October 22, 1993, that describes procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring. The modification involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the right channel input wires from the connection to the SPC, capping and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stowing the removed wires, installing splices from the left-hand channel input to the right-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand channel connection of the SPC, and installing a ground jumper wire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishment of these wiring changes will prevent a build-up effect of AHRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tolerances and unequal signals between the left- and right-hand SPC channels. Transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;93&hyph;27, dated October 26, 1993, in order to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require modification of the SPS input wiring. The modification would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
This proposed AD would also require revising the Normal Procedures section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that a pre-flight check of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start. Finally, this proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require modification of the AHRS to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This modification would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
It should be noted that Canadian AD CF&hyph;93&hyph;27 requires that the flight crew be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advised of the possibility of an inadvertent inhibition of the stall horn, light, and stick push 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
command at a roll rate within the normal flight envelope, and that an ``SPS FAILURE'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caution message will be displayed on the primary flight display. The Canadian AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that when such a message is displayed, appropriate abnormal procedures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFM should be followed. However, the FAA's position in this regard is that it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to include a requirement in this proposed AD to direct the flight crew to follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing AFM procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required parts would be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $110 per airplane. This total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the operations of crude petroleum refineries approved as foreign trade subzones. The proposed rule is necessary
to implement a section of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 which amended the Foreign Trade Zone
Act to make specific provision for petroleum refinery subzones. Customs has significantly revised the initial notice
of proposed rulemaking as a result of the extensive and varied input received from the oil refinery and foreign trade
zone communities, as well as from other interested parties, in response to the initial notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35530), Customs published a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, proposing to amend the Customs Regulations to add special procedures and requirements governing the operations
of crude petroleum refineries approved as foreign trade subzones, in implementation of section 9002 of the Technical
and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, which amended the Foreign Trade Zones Act, 19 U.S.C. 81c(d), to make specific
provision for petroleum refinery subzones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Briefly, as stated in the August 10, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking, the amendment obviates the need to determine
exactly when and where in the manufacturing process crude and other feedstocks become other products. In so doing,
it permits refiners as well as Customs to assess the relative value of such multiple products at the end of the manufacturing
period from which such products were produced, when the actual quantities of these products resulting from the refining
process can be measured with certainty. Also, the amendment permits the products refined in a subzone during a manufacturing
period to be attributed to given crude or other feedstocks introduced into production during the period, to the extent
that such products were producible (could have been produced) therefrom in the quantities removed from the subzone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1992 (57 FR 41896), Customs extended the public comment period for the proposed rule until December
8, 1992. Subsequently, by a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 24, 1992 (57 FR 55198), Customs further extended the public comment period until February 8, 1993, and
gave notice of a public meeting which was held on December 15 and 16, 1992, concerning the proposed amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the extensive and varied input received from the oil refinery and foreign trade zone communities, as
well as from other interested parties, in response to the initial notice of proposed rulemaking and the public meeting,
Customs has decided to significantly revise its initial notice, and is requesting additional public comment on the
revised proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion includes a summary of the various comments received in response to the August 10, 1992, notice
of proposed rulemaking, together with an explanation and analysis regarding the sections proposed to be added, eliminated
or further revised. The proposed rule as revised is thereafter set forth.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters favor deletion of proposed &sect;146.92(a), involving the definition of ``Assay''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs agrees. Laboratory analyses are sufficient to verify feedstock characteristics and provide API gravity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters indicated that the cumulative entry activity report defined in proposed &sect;146.92 (c) is only
required in the Houston District and, therefore, favor its deletion because the information is already contained
in the subzone activity report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon further consideration, Customs has determined to delete proposed &sect;146.92 (c), (d), (h) and (l), involving
the report in question, as well as certain related reports, specifically, the duty and user fee report, the inventory
disposition report, and the product shipment report, all of which were principally addressed in proposed &sect;146.96
which, as a result, is also deleted from the proposed rule.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters indicated that the definition in proposed &sect;146.92(e) concerning ``feedstock'' should be expanded
to include natural gas and other hydrocarbons to comply with EPA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs agrees and has so modified the wording of proposed &sect;146.92(e) (now redesignated as &sect;146.92(b)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters noted that proposed &sect;146.92(f) defining ``final product'' should also include products consumed
in the zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs agrees with this suggestion and has so changed proposed &sect;146.92(f) (now redesignated as &sect;146.92(d)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters indicated that fungibility is already defined in &sect;146.1(b), and that a definition for this
term is not needed in the proposed subpart if the assay requirement is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs agrees. Proposed &sect;146.92(g) has been eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A majority of commenters propose that the ``manufacturing period'' coincide with the normal accounting cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After reviewing the comments, particularly those of the Congressional sponsors of the legislation, Customs is convinced
that a literal interpretation of the statutory language would not be appropriate. Therefore, proposed &sect;146.92(i)
(now redesignated as &sect;146.92(e)) dealing with this matter has been reworded. The definition allows an operator
to make the attribution of a final product either during the period in which the final product was produced (even if
not consumed or removed from the refinery subzone during that same period) or the period in which the final product
was consumed or removed from the zone (even if the final product was made in a prior period). The selection of the method
is at the operator's option, but once selected, the method must be used consistently.

 Customs agrees that standard product values, based on published prices, may be utilized, but that this must be done
on a consistent basis. Thus, proposed &sect;146.92(j) (now redesignated as &sect;146.92(g)), involving the price
of products in the subzone, has been reworded.

 Most commenters suggested rewording proposed &sect;146.92(n) which defined the ``relative value'' of products
produced in the subzone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of ``relative value'' proposed by the commenters has been included in proposed &sect;146.92(n) (now
redesignated as &sect;146.92(i)) because it states the same information as the proposed regulation, albeit more
succinctly.

Customs agrees that the ``time of separation'' coincides with the ``manufacturing period''. Therefore, proposed
&sect;146.92(p) (now redesignated as &sect;146.92(k)) defining the time of separation has been modified accordingly.

Most commenters favor deletion of proposed &sect;146.92(q) which defines the term ``unique identifier'' (UIN)
because this term is already defined in &sect;146.1(b)(19).

Most commenters proposed eliminating proposed &sect;146.93(a)(1) regarding the use of the UIN (unique identifier)

Customs agrees that existing &sect;146.22 adequately addresses this matter, and, therefore, paragraphs (a), (a)(1)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters suggest deletion of the requirement that domestic feedstock be assigned a UIN, as provided in proposed
&sect;146.93(c)(1), because existing regulations do not require that a Customs Form (CF) 214 be filed on domestic
feedstocks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs agrees that a CF 214 is not required, and, therefore, proposed &sect;146.93(c)(1) has been deleted. Nevertheless,
it must be noted that a domestic feedstock must be assigned a UIN under existing regulations.

A few commenters suggested that references to T.D. 66&hyph;16 concerning the attribution of final product to given
feedstock be eliminated from proposed &sect;146.93(d)(1) because this is already discussed elsewhere in the proposed
regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs agrees and, therefore, the proposed language has been duly modified and the section redesignated as proposed
&sect;146.93(a)(1). Also, proposed &sect;146.93(d)(2) (now redesignated as &sect;146.93(a)(3)) dealing with
attribution using alternative inventory control has been revised to make reference to the use of FIFO; the use of FIFO
is illustrated in an Appendix which has been added to the revision of proposed subpart H. In addition, proposed &sect;146.93(d)(3)
dealing with ``stock in process'' has been deleted, in concert with the deletion of this term from the definition section;
in its place, a new proposed &sect;146.93(a)(2) makes reference to the use of actual production records in attributing
product to feedstock.

Commenters objected to the language of proposed &sect;146.94(a) regarding the introduction of feedstock into the

The commenters have misread this section, the purpose of which is to establish the amount and identity of the feedstocks
available for attribution during each manufacturing period. The proposed language has been modified to eliminate
any such misunderstanding.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters indicated that the language contained in proposed &sect;146.94(c) regarding the removal of product
from a refinery subzone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is specific to a calendar week. However, an accounting period may be greater than a week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a manufacturing or accounting period may be greater than a week, there is no authority to permit a consumption
entry covering products removed from a zone to exceed one week. Thus, the language of &sect;146.94(c) remains in substance
as originally proposed. However, Customs will reevaluate the possibility of permitting monthly entries, in light
of the Customs modernization portion of the recently passed North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act, particularly &sect;637. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, a refiner who desires to make attributions on the basis of a monthly manufacturing or accounting period
must attribute and make any required relative value calculation by attributing current removals or consumptions
to final products that were produced in a prior manufacturing or accounting period. A refiner who reports removals
and consumption on a weekly basis and who elects to attribute a final product that is removed or consumed, in the same
week that it is produced, must make the appropriate attribution and relative value calculation for that week.

Commenters noted that attribution is more appropriately dealt with in proposed &sect;146.99 (now redesignated

Customs agrees with the comments that attribution can be dealt with more appropriately in proposed &sect;146.99
(now redesignated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;146.96); therefore, proposed &sect;146.95 concerning feedstock inventories has been deleted. Proposed

Proposed &sect;146.99(a) (now redesignated as &sect;146.96(a)) has been modified to address this concern. Reconciliation

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters noted that other inventory control methods are already covered in proposed &sect;146.93(d)(2), so there

Customs has decided to essentially revise former proposed

&sect;146.99(c) and to make it the subject of a new &sect;146.97 regarding the approval of other recordkeeping systems
for subzone oil refinery operations. As already noted above, proposed &sect;146.93(d)(2) (now redesignated as
&sect;146.93(a)(3)) has been revised to refer exclusively to the use of the FIFO method of inventory accounting.

After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined to republish
the proposal with the modifications noted and to allow interested persons an additional opportunity to submit comments
on the proposal. Also, Customs has determined to add definitions in the revised proposed rule for ``feedstock factor'',
``petroleum refinery'', and ``refinery operating unit'', and to eliminate the definitions for ``protection of
the revenue'' and ``stock in process'' formerly set forth in proposed &sect;146.92(m) and (o), respectively. Commenters
on the original proposal need not resubmit their comments. They will be considered along with any new comments received

Consumption or removal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The consumption or removal of a final product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day of that
week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption
occurred, unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see Example II to Appendix to this subpart).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gain or loss.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing period must be taken into account in determining the attribution
of a final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in
a final product attributed to a nonprivileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for consumption unless
otherwise exempt from duty.

Calculating feedstock factor to account for volume gain.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of production per product category by the quotient
of the total value of production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be applied to a finished product
that has been attributed to a feedstock to account for volume gain.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis necessary for the producibility attribution
method are contained in tables published in T.D. 66&hyph;16. With these tables, a subzone operator may attribute
final products consumed in, or removed from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior manufacturing
period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is not listed in T.D. 66&hyph;16, the operator must
submit a proposed attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the appropriate district director.
If an operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails to keep records on that basis, Customs
shall use the operator's actual operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative value calculation.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A subzone operator must attribute the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks
introduced into a refinery operating unit during the current or a prior period. Attribution of the final products
is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using
the industry standards of potential production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66&hyph;16. Once attribution is made for a particular product,
that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into
account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Attribution to privileged foreign feedstock; relative value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign feedstock, their relative values must be
assigned.

 An operator may use the actual refinery production records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed
products. Customs shall accept the operator's recordation conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates
that it actually uses the conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever convention is elected by the operator,
it must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs.

Example. If the operator mixes three equal quantities of material in a day tank and treats that product as a three-part
mixture in its production unit, Customs will accept the resulting product as composed of the three materials. If,
in the alternative, the operator assumes that the three products do not mix and treats the first product as being composed
of the first material put into the day tank, the second product as composed of the second material put into the day tank,
and the third product as being composed of the third material put into the day tank, Customs will accept that convention
also.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be made when a finished product is removed from or
consumed in the subzone, and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Removal from the refinery subzone for exportation of 50,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds of aviation gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period of manufacture for the aviation gasoline is Day 1 to Day 20. The refiner must first attribute the designated
source of the aviation gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to maximize the duty benefit conferred by the zone operation, the refiner chooses to attribute the exported
aviation gasoline to the privileged foreign status crude oil. Under the tables for potential production (T.D. 66&hyph;16),
class II crude has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 30% potential, and class III has a 40% potential. The maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation gasoline producible from the class II crude oil is 15,000 pounds (50,000 &times; .30). The maximum aviation
gasoline producible from the privileged foreign status class III crude oil is 20,000 pounds (50,000 &times; .40).
The domestic class III crude would also make 20,000 pounds of aviation gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refiner could attribute 15,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class II crude oil, 20,000 pounds of the privileged
foreign class III crude oil, and 15,000 pounds of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the 50,000 pounds
of the aviation gasoline that was exported; 35,000 pounds of class II crude oil would be available for further production
for other than aviation gasoline, 30,000 pounds of privileged foreign class III crude oil would be available for further
production for other than aviation gasoline, and 35,000 pounds of domestic status class III crude oil would be available
for further production, of which up to 5,000 pounds could be attributed to aviation gasoline.

To the extent that the crude oils that entered production on Day 1 are attributed as the designated sources for the products

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed on Day 30, the period of manufacture is Day 1 to Day 30. If the refiner chooses to attribute the crude oils that
entered production on Day 21 as the designated sources of the products removed on Day 30 using the production standards
published in T.D. 66&hyph;16, the manufacturing period is Day 21 to Day 30. This 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choice will be important if a relative value calculation on the privileged foreign status crude oil is required, because
the law requires the value used for computing the relative value to be the average per unit value of each product for
the manufacturing period. Relative value must be calculated if a source feedstock is separated into two or more products
that are removed from the subzone refinery. If the average per unit value for each product differs between the manufacturing
period from Day 1 to Day 30 and the manufacturing period from Day 21 to Day 30, the correct period must be used in the calculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to minimize duty liability, the refiner would try to attribute the production of the exported kerosene and
the sale of the jet fuel to the US Air Force to the privileged foreign crude oils. For the same reason, the refiner would
try to attribute the removed motor gasoline and the aviation gasoline for the commuter airline to the domestic crude
oil.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the refiner chooses to attribute up to 5,000 pounds of the domestic status class III crude as the source
of the 10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline removed from the subzone refinery for the commuter airline. Since no other
aviation gasoline could have been produced from the crude oils that entered production on Day 1, the refiner must attribute
the remainder to the crude oils that entered production on Day 21. Again, using the production standards from T.D.
66&hyph;16, the class I crude could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 10,000 pounds (50,000 &times; .20).
Likewise, the class IV crude oil could 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 8,500 pounds (50,000 &times; .17). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refiner selects use of the class I crude as the source of the aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute up to
27,300 pounds (35,000_5,000 &times; .91) of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the motor gasoline. This
would leave 2,700 pounds of domestic class III crude available for further production for other than aviation gasoline
or motor gasoline. The remaining motor gasoline removed (also 2,700 pounds) must be attributed to a privileged foreign
crude oil. The refiner selects the privileged foreign class II crude oil that entered production on Day 1 as the source
for the remaining 2,700 pounds of motor gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would leave 32,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which
no more than 27,400 pounds could be designated as the source of motor gasoline. The refiner attributes the jet fuel
that is removed from the refinery subzone for the US Air Force for use in military aircraft to the privileged foreign
class II crude oil. The refiner could attribute up to 20,995 pounds of jet fuel from that class II crude oil (32,300 &times;
.65). Designating that class II crude oil as the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel leaves 22,300 pounds of privileged
foreign class II crude oil available for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, of which up to 10,995 pounds could be attributed as the source of the jet fuel. Because the motor gasoline
and the jet fuel, under the foregoing attribution, would be considered to have been separated from the privileged
foreign class II crude oil, a relative value calculation would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The jet fuel is eligible for removal from the subzone free of duty by virtue of 19 U.S.C. 1309(a)(1)(A). The refiner
could attribute the privileged foreign class II crude oil as being the source of 9,812 pounds of jet fuel (22,300 &times;
.44). The refiner chooses to attribute the privileged foreign class III crude oil as the source of the jet fuel. The
refiner could attribute to that class III crude oil up to 15,000 pounds of kerosene (30,000 &times; .50).

Removal from the refinery subzone 119 barrels of residual oils to customs territory, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the operator uses the FIFO method of attribution, as the product is removed from the subzone, or consumed or lost
within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subzone, attribution must be to the oldest feedstock available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attribution. Accordingly, the 40,000 pounds (119 barrels) of residual oils will be attributed to 40,000 pounds of
the PF Class II crude oil from Day 1&hyph;5.

premises and did not enter customs territory, thus no duty is applicable. Likewise, the process loss occurred entirely
within the subzone. Therefore, no duty is applicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 20, 1993, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted materials in response to requirements
in part D of title I of the Clean Air Act for new source review in nonattainment areas. This submittal included no revisions
to any Ohio regulations. Instead, the submittal described how Ohio intended to implement various applicable part
D requirements, and presented a rationale that no revisions to State regulations would be necessary to satisfy these
requirements. USEPA disagrees with this rationale and proposes to disapprove the State's submittal for failure
to satisfy applicable requirements.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 20, 1993, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted a letter with attachments to the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) addressing new source review in nonattainment areas. USEPA notified
OEPA on October 22, 1993, that it found this submittal complete. This submittal was intended to satisfy Clean Air Act
requirements for new source review in nonattainment areas, particularly the new requirements established by the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions for new source review in Ohio were included in the original State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted
on January 31, 1972, and replacement regulations submitted on June 6, 1973. The relevant regulations provided for
best available control technology (BACT) and other requirements applied uniformly throughout the State. Subsequently,
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 provided for designations of areas as being in attainment or nonattainment of
the air quality standards, and required a further State submittal to impose additional requirements (most notably
lowest achievable emission rates (LAER) and offsets) for new sources in nonattainment areas. Ohio submitted relevant
material on July 25, 1980, and September 25, 1980. USEPA conditionally approved these submittals on October 31, 1980,
on the condition that Ohio submit regulations delineating requirements that new sources in nonattainment areas
must meet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio submitted revised regulations on October 4, 1982, and January 24, 1983. These regulations impose nonattainment
area new source permitting requirements by incorporating appendix S to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
part 51 (appendix S to 40 CFR part 51_''Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling'') into the State regulations. USEPA
granted limited approval to this submittal on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211), concluding that the regulation strengthened
the SIP but did not fully satisfy the nonattainment area planning requirements established in 1977 in part D of title
I of the Clean Air Act. Of particular concern were the exemptions of temporary sources and resource recovery facilities
provided in appendix S (and thus incorporated by reference in the State rules) but not approvable under the criteria
established in 40 CFR part 51, subpart I. By the time of this 1993 rulemaking, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 had
imposed further requirements for nonattainment area new source review. The State provided USEPA material concerning
the new requirements on November 19, 1992, December 2, 1992, January 13, 1993, and April 26, 1993. USEPA notified the
State on June 1, 1993, that these materials did not represent a complete submittal. The State then provided additional
information on August 20, 1993, which USEPA found on October 22, 1993, to constitute a complete submittal. USEPA has
conducted a full review and proposes to disapprove the submittal for failing to satisfy the current nonattainment
area new source review requirements of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 established numerous new requirements for new source review. Among the more significant
of these requirements that apply to Ohio are provisions for specific emission offset requirements in ozone nonattainment
areas, including specified minimum offset rations, for review of major new sources and major modifications for nitrogen
oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in ozone nonattainment areas, and for an alternative siting analysis for all nonattainment area pollutants. Additionally,
the State plan must include provisions for proper calculation of offsets, provisions reflecting certain substantial
restrictions on growth allowances, provisions for supplying from nonattainment new source review permits to USEPA's
RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, provisions relating to rocket engines or motors, provisions relating to stripper
wells, provisions relating to the definition of ``stationary source'' affecting the treatment of internal combustion
engine sources, and provisions relating to temporary clean coal technology demonstration projects.

The amended Act also requires that new source review requirements apply to lower size sources in areas classified
Serious or above, and in some cases requires new source review for particulate matter precursor sources in particulate
matter nonattainment areas. However, Ohio presently has no areas classified Serious or above, and the requirement
relating to particulate matter precursors will not apply if USEPA finalizes a determination proposed on August 3,
1993, that precursors do not contribute significantly to particulate matter violations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments also specify various deadlines for submittal of SIP revisions to satisfy these requirements.
For areas designated nonattainment for fine particulate matter, a plan satisfying the requirements of sections
173 and 189 was to be submitted by June 30, 1992. For areas designated nonattainment and classified as marginal or above
for ozone, a plan satisfying the requirements of sections 173 and 182 was to be submitted by November 15, 1992. For areas
designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide, a plan satisfying the requirements of section 173 was to be submitted
by November 15, 1993. The State of Ohio has areas designated nonattainment for ozone and particulate matter, for which
it was required to meet these SIP revision deadlines. The August 20, 1993, material was submitted in an effort to satisfy
these requirements.

II. Review of State's Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Review Relative to Pre&hyph;1990 Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's recent submittal does not address new source review requirements that applied prior to the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. Therefore, the USEPA review of the State's plan relative to pre&hyph;1990 requirements published
on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211), remains current. The September 8 notice granted limited approval on the basis of
the strengthening effect of the 1982 regulations relative to the prior SIP, but found the State's plan to be insufficient
to meet the pre&hyph;1990 new source review requirements. The 1982 regulations essentially incorporate appendix
S of 40 CFR part 51 by reference. USEPA identified deficiencies relating to the exemptions from offset requirements
for resource recovery facilities and temporary sources provided in appendix S and therefore incorporated by reference
into Ohio's regulations. Since these deficiencies have not been addressed, the State's new source review program
continues to fail to satisfy part D requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The September 8 notice also noted that the provisions of appendix S, as incorporated by reference into Ohio's regulations,
are not as explicit as the current requirements of subpart I of 40 CFR part 51 for annual, actual emissions offsets.
Although USEPA interprets Ohio's regulations to require that federally enforceable actual emission offsets be
obtained as a condition of any permit pursuant to part D, section 173(c) requires that Ohio clarify that this requirement
applies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Review Relative to Post&hyph;1990 Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substance of Ohio's submittal of August 20, 1993, is a document entitled ``Ohio EPA New Source Review State Implementation
Plan_Requirements for Major New Sources in Nonattainment Areas.'' This document focuses on requirements established
by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and identifies OEPA's plans for implementing these requirements. This document
is referred to below as Ohio's statement of permitting criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State's submittal provides no new regulations to govern review of new sources in nonattainment areas. Instead,
the submittal states that regulations adopted in 1974 provide the necessary authority to implement the new requirements
for new source review, and that these SIP approved regulations in conjunction with the submittal's statement of permitting
criteria should satisfy Clean Air Act requirements. Thus, a key question in this rulemaking is whether USEPA can approve
this approach and enforce the intended permitting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA, in its technical support document, evaluated the adequacy with which Ohio's submittal satisfies selected
key requirements. USEPA's review indicated that the statement of permitting criteria does not provide adequate
specificity and clarity of criteria by which detailed implementation decisions would be made. The following discussion
of sample requirements illustrates the basis for this conclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that specified offset ratios for volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions
and presumptively for nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions must be obtained in ozone nonattainment areas. That is, any significant increase in potential emissions
for either of these pollutants must be accompanied by an decrease in actual emissions that is larger by at least a specified
ratio. Ohio's statement of permitting criteria includes: (1) A preliminary clause stating that ``the following
additional requirements will be applicable,'' (2) an item 1 identifying ``minimum required offset ratios,'' and
(3) an item 4 noting that ``NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 . . . shall be treated as a nonattainment pollutant'' in ozone nonattainment areas. No definition of offset ratio is
provided, and so it is unclear what averaging time applies, whether offsets are to reflect allowable or actual emissions,
whether all emission increases must be offset (e.g., fugitive and secondary emissions), where the offsets must occur,
and whether interpollutant offsets are permissible. (Item 4 of Ohio's statement implies that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offsets must come from the same county as the emission increases.) The statement also does not explicitly state that
either VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offsets are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second new requirement is that the other various major source requirements (e.g., lowest achievable emission rates)
also apply to major sources of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in ozone nonattainment areas, unless USEPA makes certain determinations that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control would not be beneficial. Ohio implies the applicability of these requirements by making the above statement
that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is to be treated as a nonattainment pollutant. Ohio's statement continues that ``[n]ew source applicants are required
to meet the major new source definitions and major modifications thresholds as specified in the CAA.'' However, the
Clean Air Act itself does not explicitly define ``major new source'' and does not specify major modification thresholds.
Also, Ohio's statement could be read to require all sources to meet the size minimums for major new sources or major
modifications. Ohio's statement continues: ``For major modifications, these CAA requirements will be applicable
to sources of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 greater than 40 tons per year.'' It is not clear whether Ohio intends this apparent reduction from 100 to 40 tons per
year of the threshold of source sizes at which major modifications trigger new source review requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review of further requirements established by the 1990 Amendments is provided in the technical support document.
The conclusion of USEPA's review is that the statement of permitting criteria does not address many of the questions
that would arise in imposing the identified requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Analysis of the Need for Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above examples clarify a central issue in this rulemaking, i.e. whether formal regulations are necessary to establish
the requirements dictated by the Clean Air Act. Ohio's statement and the submittal cover letter present the State's
position that existing Ohio statutes and regulations already require that the provisions of the amended Clean Air
Act be met. Specifically, Ohio notes that its Rule 3745&hyph;31&hyph;05 requires that permits to install shall be
issued only if the construction and operation will ``not result in a violation of any applicable laws,'' which is defined
to include the Clean Air Act including any amendments. Although Ohio proceeds to describe in general terms how it intends
to apply the new requirements, the submittal cover letter expressly states that ``the current, federally approved,
Ohio SIP is adequate for fulfilling the requirements of a NSR SIP, and that no changes are necessary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio's position raises fundamental questions about the role of implementing regulations. In general, statutes
present general criteria that must be met, whereas regulations define the specific requirements that apply in each
circumstance. In limited circumstances a statute may be enforced without implementing regulations, but generally
regulations are necessary to define the precise obligations of affected individuals and the precise criteria by
which relevant decisions (e.g. determinations of compliance) will be made. The proper adoption of clearly defined
criteria for making relevant decisions is essential to support these decisions. Therefore, in the absence of exhaustively
detailed statutes, the adoption of detailed regulations is essential for successful program implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of new source review, the Clean Air Act identifies general provisions which are to be included in State plans.
The State's statement of permitting criteria closely parallels the language in the Clean Air Act. As the above examples
illustrate, Ohio's submittal fails to define many of the details of how these requirements would be implemented.
In the absence of these details, a subject source could not be expected to know its obligations pursuant to these requirements,
and could object to the imposition of the general requirements based on the failure of the State to pre-define the specific
criteria that would be applied. Further, as a commenter noted when the State proposed its SIP revision, the statement
of permitting criteria was not adopted according to the full procedures in Ohio for adoption of regulations, even
though this statement is intended to serve purposes normally served by regulations. Consequently, the statement
of permitting criteria lacks the specificity, the regulatory standing, and the assurance of being enforceable that
are needed to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA's review indicates that Ohio's submittal does not clearly establish the specific criteria by which judgments
in new source permitting will be made. Furthermore, by relying not on properly adopted regulations but rather on a
general regulatory provision (requiring compliance with the Clean Air Act) in conjunction with a statement of permitting
criteria, the State has failed to follow proper procedures to become authorized to impose specific, detailed permit
conditions in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements. In addition, the existing regulations exempt two types
of sources which may not be exempted under applicable USEPA regulations. For these reasons, USEPA proposes to disapprove
Ohio's submittal for failure to satisfy part D requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 179(a)(2), if USEPA takes final action to disapprove a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated
nonattainment based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, USEPA must
apply one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of
such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to USEPA: highway funding restrictions, and
a requirement for two-for-one offsets. The 18-month period referred to in section 179(a) would begin to run at the
time USEPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval would trigger the Federal
Implementation Plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). Separate rulemaking is being conducted to identify
which sanction would apply first and to address related issues on the application of sanctions, for example whether
USEPA must publish final approval of a new submittal before the deficiency may be considered corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment is solicited on this proposed rulemaking action. Comments received by [Insert date 30 days from date
of publication] will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval.
Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's disapproval
of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this disapproval
action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing
requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to grant a petition submitted by Bethlehem Steel
Corporation (BSC), Sparrows Point, Maryland, to exclude certain solid wastes generated at its facility from the
lists of hazardous wastes contained in &sect;261.31 and &sect;261.32. This action responds to a delisting petition
submitted under &sect;260.20, which allows any person to petition the Administrator to modify or revoke any provision
of Parts 260 through 265 and 268 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and under &sect;260.22, which specifically
provides generators the opportunity to petition the Administrator to exclude a waste on a ``generator-specific''
basis from the hazardous waste lists. The proposed decision is based on an evaluation of waste-specific information
provided by the petitioner. If this proposed decision is finalized, the petitioned waste will be conditionally excluded
from regulation as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is also proposing the use of a fate and transport model to evaluate the potential impact of the petitioned
waste on human health and the environment, based on the waste-specific information provided by the petitioner. This
model has been used in evaluating the petition to predict the concentration of hazardous constituents that may be
released from the petitioned waste, once it is disposed of.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulations implementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published
an amended list of hazardous wastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amended several times,
and is published in &sect;261.31 and &sect;261.32. These wastes are listed as hazardous because they typically and
frequently exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in Subpart C of part 261 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in &sect;&sect;261.11(a)(2)
or (a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials, industrial processes, and other factors.
Thus, while a waste that is described in these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individual
facility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, &sect;260.20 and &sect;260.22 provide an exclusion
procedure, allowing persons to demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facility should not
be regulated as a hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generated at their facilities do not meet any of the
criteria for which the wastes were listed. See &sect;260.22(a) and the background documents for the listed wastes.
In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including
additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if there is a reasonable basis to believe
that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstrate
that the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and toxicity), and must present sufficient information for the Agency
to determine whether the waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See &sect;260.22(a), 42 U.S.C.
6921(f), and the background documents for the listed wastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or not they exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste,
generators remain obligated under RCRA to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardous based on the
hazardous waste characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastes and mixtures containing
listed hazardous wastes are also considered hazardous wastes. See &sect;&sect;261.3 (a)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(i),
referred to as the ``mixture'' and ``derived-from'' rules, respectively. Such wastes are also eligible for exclusion
and remain hazardous wastes until excluded. On December 6, 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
vacated the ``mixture/derived from'' rules and remanded them to the Agency on procedural grounds (

, 950 F.2d 741 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). On March 3, 1992, EPA reinstated the mixture and derived-from rules, and solicited
comments on other ways to regulate waste mixtures and residues (57 FR 7628). The Agency plans to address issues related
to waste mixtures and residues in a future rulemaking.

B. Approach Used To Evaluate This Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This petition requests a delisting for a listed hazardous waste. In making the initial delisting determination,
the Agency evaluated the petitioned waste against the listing criteria and factors cited in &sect;&sect;261.11(a)(2)
and (a)(3). Based on this review, the Agency agreed with the petitioner that the waste is non-hazardous with respect
to the original listing criteria. (If the Agency had found, based on this review, that the waste remained hazardous
based on the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA would have proposed to deny the petition.) EPA then
evaluated the waste with respect to other factors or criteria to assess whether there is a reasonable basis to believe
that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considered whether the waste is acutely
toxic, and considered the toxicity of the constituents, the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their
tendency to migrate and to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once released from the waste, plausible
and specific types of management of the petitioned waste, the quantities of waste generated, and waste variability.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For this delisting determination, the Agency used such information to identify plausible exposure routes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ground water, surface water, air) for hazardous constituents present in the petitioned waste. The Agency determined
that disposal in a landfill is the most reasonable, worst-case disposal scenario for BSC's petitioned waste, and
that the major exposure route of concern would be ingestion of contaminated ground water. Therefore, the Agency is
proposing to use a particular fate and transport model to predict the maximum allowable concentrations of hazardous
constituents that may be released from the petitioned waste after disposal in a regulated municipal solid waste landfill
and to determine the potential impact of disposal of BSC's waste on human health and the environment. Specifically,
the Agency used the maximum estimated waste volume and the maximum reported leachate concentrations as inputs to
estimate the constituent concentrations in the ground water at a hypothetical receptor well downgradient from the
disposal site. The calculated receptor well concentrations (referred to as compliance-point concentrations)
were then compared directly to the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making for the hazardous constituents
of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that this fate and transport model represents a reasonable worst-case scenario for disposal of the petitioned
waste in a landfill, and that a reasonable worst-case scenario is appropriate when evaluating whether a waste should
be relieved of the protective management constraints of RCRA Subtitle C. The use of a reasonable worst-case scenario
results in conservative values for the compliance-point concentrations and ensures that the waste, once removed
from hazardous waste regulation, will not pose a threat to human health or the environment. Because a delisted waste
is no longer subject to hazardous waste control, the Agency is generally unable to predict and does not control how
a waste will be managed after delisting. Therefore, EPA currently believes that it is inappropriate to consider extensive
site-specific factors when applying the fate and transport model. For example, a generator may petition the Agency
for delisting of a metal hydroxide sludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and provide data
on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities, etc. If the Agency were to base its
evaluation solely on these site-specific factors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location,
cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition. Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however,
the generator is under no obligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. In fact, it is likely that
the generator will either choose to send the delisted waste off-site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity
of the on-site facility and subsequently send the waste off site to a facility which may have very different hydrogeological
and exposure conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoring data during the evaluation of delisting
petitions. In this case, the Agency determined that, because BSC is seeking an upfront delisting (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an exclusion based on data from waste generated from a bench-scale treatment process), ground-water monitoring
data collected from the areas where the petitioner plans to dispose of the waste in the future are not necessary. Because
the petitioned waste is not currently generated or disposed of, ground-water monitoring data would not characterize
the effects of the petitioned waste on the underlying aquifer at the disposal sites and, thus, would serve no purpose.
Therefore, the Agency did not request ground-water monitoring data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC petitioned the Agency for an upfront exclusion (for waste that has not yet been generated) based on descriptions
of the proposed stabilization process that will be used to treat BSC's dewatered filter cake, characterization of
dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, and results from the analysis of waste subjected to BSC's proposed stabilization
process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar to other facilities seeking upfront exclusions, this upfront exclusion (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an exclusion based on information characterizing the process and waste) would be contingent upon the analytical
testing of the petitioned waste once stabilization is initiated at BSC's Sparrows Point facility. Specifically,
BSC will be required to collect representative samples of stabilized filter cake to verify that the stabilization
process is on-line and operating as described in the petition. The verification testing requires BSC to demonstrate
that the proposed stabilization process, once on-line, will generate a non-hazardous waste (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a waste that meets the Agency's verification testing conditions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the evaluation of BSC's delisting petition, a list of constituents was developed for the verification testing
conditions. Tentative maximum allowable leachable concentrations for these constituents were derived by back
calculating from the delisting health-based levels through the proposed fate and transport model for a landfill
management scenario. These concentrations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``delisting levels'') are the proposed verification testing conditions of the exclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency encourages the use of upfront delisting petitions because they have the advantage of allowing the applicant
to know what treatment levels for constituents will be sufficient to render specific wastes non-hazardous, before
investing in new or modified waste treatment systems. Therefore, upfront delistings will allow new facilities to
receive exclusions prior to generating wastes, which, without upfront exclusions, would unnecessarily have been
considered hazardous. Upfront delistings for existing facilities can be processed concurrently during construction
or permitting activities; therefore, new or modified treatment systems should be capable of producing wastes that
are considered non-hazardous, and managed as such sooner than otherwise would be possible. At the same time, conditional
testing requirements to verify that the delisting levels are achieved by the fully operational treatment systems
will maintain the integrity of the delisting program and will ensure that only non-hazardous wastes are removed from
Subtitle C control.

Finally, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 specifically require the Agency to provide notice and an
opportunity for comment before granting or denying a final exclusion. Thus, a final decision will not be made until
all public comments (including those at public hearings, if any) on today's proposal are addressed.

A. Petition for Exclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bethlehem Steel Corporation (BSC), located in Sparrows Point, Maryland, is involved in the production of tin and
chromium plated parts and steel strip. BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude its chemically stabilized wastewater
treatment filter cake presently listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006_``Wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating
operations except from the following processes: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum; (2) tin plating on carbon
steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) on carbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel;
(5) cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbon steel; and (6) chemical etching
and milling of aluminum''. The listed constituents of concern for EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006 waste are cadmium,
hexavalent chromium, nickel, and cyanide (complexed) (see part 261, appendix VII).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude its stabilized filter cake because it does not believe that the waste, once generated,
will meet the criteria of the listing. BSC claims that its treatment process will generate a non-hazardous waste because
the constituents of concern in the waste are either not present or are in an essentially immobile form. BSC also believes
that the waste will not contain any other constituents that would render the waste hazardous. Review of this petition
included consideration of the original listing criteria, as well as the additional factors required by the Hazardous
and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. See section 222 of HSWA, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and 40 CFR 260.22(d)(2)&hyph;(4).
Today's proposal to grant this petition for delisting is the result of the Agency's evaluation of BSC's petition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 2, 1991, BSC petitioned the Agency to exclude its stabilized filter cake from the lists of hazardous wastes
contained in &sect;261.31 and &sect;261.32, and subsequently provided additional information to complete its
petition. Specifically, BSC requested that the Agency grant an upfront exclusion (

i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an exclusion that applies to waste not presently generated) for dewatered filter cake that will be stabilized using
lime kiln dust and powerplant fly ash at its Sparrows Point facility.

In support of its petition, BSC submitted: (1) Detailed descriptions of its manufacturing, waste treatment, and
stabilization processes, including schematic diagrams; (2) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for all trade name
products used in the manufacturing and waste treatment processes; (3) results from total constituent analyses for
the eight Toxicity Characteristic (TC) metals listed in &sect;261.24, nickel, cyanide, zinc, and sulfide from representative
samples of the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake and the stabilized filter cake; (4) results from the EP Toxicity
Test and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP, SW&hyph;846 Method 1311) for the eight TC metals
(except for barium and selenium) and nickel from representative samples of the dewatered (unstabilized) filter
cake, uncured stabilized filter cake, and the cured stabilized filter cake; (5) results from total oil and grease
analyses from representative samples of the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake and stabilized filter cake; (6)
results from the Multiple Extraction Procedure (MEP, SW&hyph;846 Method 1320) for the eight TC metals (except for
barium and selenium) and nickel from representative samples of the stabilized filter cake; (7) test results and information
regarding the hazardous characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity; (8) results from the TCLP
analyses for the TC volatile and semivolatile organic compounds from representative samples of the dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake; and (9) results from total constituent analyses for hexavalent chromium from representative samples
of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Similar to other facilities seeking upfront exclusions, once BSC's proposed stabilization system is on-line at
its Sparrows Point, Maryland facility, BSC would be required to submit additional analytical data for the petitioned
waste to verify that the on-line stabilization system meets the treatment capability of the stabilization process
as described in the petition and the verification testing conditions specified in the exclusion (see Section F_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC's Sparrows Point, Maryland facility is involved in electroplating operations producing tin and chromium plated
parts and steel strip. Three plating lines contribute wastes to the wastewater treatment plant generating BSC's
chromium high density filter cake, namely, a tin free steel-chromium type (TFSCT) plating line and two halogen tinning
lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TFSCT plating line is designed to deposit a layer of chromium on the steel strip with an additional outer protective
covering of chromium oxides. The TFSCT plating line consists of five major sections: The Entry Section, the Pre-Treatment
Section, the Plating Section, the Post-Treatment Section, and the Delivery Section. The purpose of the entry section
is to join the ends of the steel coils in preparation for subsequent continuous processing in the following sections.
The pre-treatment section cleans and prepares the steel to be plated. The strip passes through an electrolytic cleaning
system, brush scrubber, and pickle and pickle rinse cells to remove oil, dirt, rust, and other foreign substances.
In the plating section, the steel strip passes through the plater conditioner cell prior to entering the plating cell.
The chromium and chromium oxide layers are electrolytically plated onto the steel strip. The steel strip is rinsed,
after it leaves the plater, in the dragout and rinse cells. In the post-treatment section, the coated steel strip is
washed, dried, and oiled prior to being coiled for shipping or storage. The oil film helps to prevent scratching of
the coated strip during handling, serves as a lubricant for punching and forming operations, and retards oxidation
and corrosion. The delivery section consists of the equipment required for strip tension control, storage, measurement
and inspection, and shearing and winding into coils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the TFSCT plating process overflow chromic acid solution from the plater conditioner, overflow rinse waters
from the dragout and rinse cells of the plater section, and overflow rinse waters from the final washer cell are sent
to a sump (the chromium sump) which collects only chromium-bearing wastewaters. The collected wastewater is then
pumped from the chromium sump to the chromium High Density Sludge (HDS) Wastewater Treatment Plant. In addition,
if it is necessary to shut down the TFSCT plating line for repairs or in the event of a strip break, chromium-bearing
wastewaters from the plater conditioner and plater section are sent to a storage tank for subsequent treatment via
the chromium HDS wastewater treatment plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two halogen tinning lines are designed to deposit a thin layer of tin on metal strip with an outer protective covering
of a very thin film of chromium and chromium oxides. The two halogen lines also consist of five major sections: the Entry
Section, the Pre-treatment Section, the Tin Plating Section, the Post-Treatment Section, and the Delivery Section.
The purpose of the entry section is to join the ends of the coils in preparation for subsequent continuous processing
in the following sections. The pre-treatment section cleans and prepares the metal strip to be plated. The metal strip
is cleaned in a hot, alkaline solution. A brush scrubber removes loosened dirt and any remaining caustic film, then
a sulfuric acid solution is used to remove metal oxides. A second brush scrubber removes the remaining acid film. In
the plating section, the cleaned, prepared metal strip is electroplated with tin. In the tin plating unit, the strip
rides on top of the halogen plating solution, while a series of soluble anodes below the surface provide the tin for
plating. The metal strip is sprayed and rinsed, after it leaves the plater, to remove any residual plating solution.
After being dried, the metal strip passes through the electrical induction reflow (melting) process where the plated
tin is converted from a matte (as plated) finish to a bright finish. The post-treatment section consists of a chemical
treatment tank and a washer. In the chemical treatment tanks sodium dichromate is used to produce a thin uniform chromium
and chromium oxide layer on the tinned surface via cathodic electrolysis. The film serves to stabilize or ``passivate''
the tinned surface preventing the undesirable tin oxides from forming. This section is completed with a dryer, Trion
oiler, and a bridle roll. The delivery section consists of the delivery looping tower, a bridle roll, inspection and
a recoil area where the metal strip is cut and transferred to empty reels.

During the halogen tinning process, rinse waters from the chemical treatment washer are sent to the chemical treat
sump and further pumped to the chromium HDS treatment system. This is the only wastewater entering the chromium HDS
wastewater treatment system from the Halogen Tinning Lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The waste streams from the TFSCT plating (chromium sump) and Halogen Tinning (chemical treat sump) lines are combined
in a 50,000-gallon storage tank. From the storage tank the wastewater is pumped to a 10,000-gallon reduction reactor
where the pH of the wastewater is adjusted by the addition of sulfuric acid. In addition, liquid sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is added to reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium. The reduced chromium wastewater is next transferred
to a 7,000-gallon neutralization tank and mixed with lime and previously-precipitated solids. The wastewater then
flows by gravity to a 1,200-gallon flocculator tank where a polymer is added to promote flocculation of the metal hydroxides.
The neutralized wastewater, containing approximately 2&hyph;5 percent solids, is then sent through a 50-foot diameter
gravity thickener, where thickened sludge is removed and subsequently dewatered by a rotary drum vacuum filter to
35&hyph;55 percent solids. The thickener effluent is filtered and the filtrate is discharged to the Tin Mill Canal
for further wastewater treatment prior to discharge to a receiving surface water body. The filtrate from the vacuum
filter and the filter backwash are returned to the flocculator tank. The dewatered filter cake is discharged to a collection
hopper and currently shipped to/treated at a permitted hazardous waste treatment facility (Envirite Corporation,
York, Pennsylvania) before disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition, BSC proposed to stabilize the dewatered filter cake using lime kiln dust and powerplant fly ash. This
process is based on the pozzolanic reaction that adsorbs and/or encapsulates the heavy metals present in the chromium
filter cake into a calcium-alumino-silicate matrix. Based on bench-scale studies of its proposed stabilization
process, BSC proposed using 3 parts lime kiln dust, 2 parts powerplant fly ash to 5 parts dewatered filter cake (by weight)
and 2 parts water to form the stabilized filter cake. Once delisted, BSC plans to dispose of the stabilized filter cake
at an on-site to-be-constructed Subtitle D landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC initially collected a total of four composite samples of its dewatered filter cake during a four-week period between
April 1, 1988 and April 28, 1988. The samples were collected using a scoop as sludge was discharged from the end of the
vacuum filter press. Each composite sample was comprised of grab samples collected over a period of approximately
five days. Portions of the composite samples were then stabilized using lime kiln dust and powerplant fly ash in a bench-scale
process. Specifically, 1,000 grams of dewatered filter cake were mixed with 600 grams of lime kiln dust, 400 grams
of powerplant fly ash, and water and allowed to cure until air-dried. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC provided analysis results for samples of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, filter cake samples that had
just been stabilized, and filter cake samples that were allowed to cure for 15 days. Four composite samples of dewatered
(unstabilized) filter cake and four composite samples of stabilized filter cake samples were analyzed for the total
concentrations (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mass of a particular constituent per mass of waste) of the eight TC metals, nickel, cyanide, zinc, sulfide, and total
oil and grease content. Composite samples of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, uncured stabilized filter cake,
and cured stabilized filter cake were also analyzed for EP Toxicity and TCLP leachate concentrations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mass of a particular constituent per unit volume of extract) of the eight TC metals (except for barium and selenium)
and nickel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 18, 1992, BSC submitted additional information which included results from the analysis of four composite
samples of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake. These samples were collected over a period of four weeks from January
15, 1992 to February 10, 1992. Using a stainless steel scoop, BSC collected grab samples from the middle and both ends
of the filter drum to ensure a representative sample. Each daily composite sample was comprised of 5 grab samples.
After the last grab sample was taken each day, the samples of filter cake were thoroughly mixed to form the daily composite.
All four dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake composite samples were analyzed for total chromium, hexavalent chromium,
and TCLP leachate concentrations of the TC volatile and semivolatile organic compounds.

BSC claims that due to consistent manufacturing and waste treatment processes, the analytical data obtained from
the two sampling events are representative of any variation in the chemically stabilized wastewater treatment filter
cake constituent concentrations. BSC further explained in its petition that the samples collected in January and
February 1992 represent filter cake generated specifically when different combinations of the three plating lines
were operating.

BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 7000 to quantify the total constituent concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium,
lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc in the filter cake samples. BSC used an Agency approved Bethlehem Steel Standard
Method

 to quantify the total constituent concentration of chromium in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method
3060 to digest the samples, and then followed Method 7195 to analyze/quantify hexavalent chromium concentrations
in the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake samples. BSC used ``Determination of Mercury in Water By Gold-Film Analyzer'',
to quantify the total constituent concentration of mercury in the filter cake samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method
9010 to quantify the total constituent concentration of cyanide in the filter cake samples. BSC used ``Methods for
Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes'' Method 376.1 to quantify the total constituent concentration of sulfide
in the filter cake samples.

Using SW&hyph;846 Method 9071, BSC determined that its stabilized filter cake had a maximum oil and grease content
of 0.099 percent; therefore, the leachate analyses did not have to be modified in accordance with the Oily Waste EP
methodology (i.e., wastes having more than one percent total oil and grease may either have significant concentrations
of constituents of concern in the oil phase, which may not be assessed using the standard leachate procedures, or the
concentration of oil and grease may be sufficient to coat the solid phase of the sample and interfere with the leaching
of metals from the sample). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1310 (EP)/Method 7000 to quantify the EP leachable concentrations of arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver in the filter cake samples, and used modified SW&hyph;846 Method 1310
(using distilled waster, instead of acetate buffer, in the extraction) and Method 9010 to quantify the EP leachable
concentration of cyanide in cured stabilized samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1311 (TCLP)/Method 7000 to quantify
the TCLP leachable concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and silver in the filter
cake samples. BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1320 (MEP)/Method 7000 to quantify the MEP leachable concentrations of
the TC metals (except for barium and selenium) and nickel in the cured stabilized filter cake.

The detection limits presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 represent the lowest concentrations quantifiable by BSC when
using the appropriate SW&hyph;846 or Agency-approved analytical methods to analyze its waste. (Detection limits
may vary according to the waste and waste matrix being analyzed,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices varies and ``dirty'' waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising
the detection limits). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC used SW&hyph;846 Method 1311 (TCLP) to leach, then followed Method 8260 and Method 8270 to quantify the leachable
concentrations of the volatile and semivolatile organic compounds listed in Table 1 of &sect;261.24. Chloroform,
the only detected organic constituent, was found at a maximum concentration of 0.0624 ppm (without blank correction)
in BSC's dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake. Chloroform was also detected at a level of 0.0950 ppm in one of two method
blanks; therefore, its presence in the waste is uncertain and may be attributed to laboratory contamination.

BSC submitted a signed certification stating that, based on the current annual generation rate of dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake, the maximum annual generation rate of stabilized filter cake will be 1,476 wet tons (approximately 1100
cubic yards, based on a bulk density of 1.34 tons per cubic yard). The Agency reviews a petitioner's estimates and,
on occasion, has requested a petitioner to re-evaluate estimated waste generation rate. EPA accepts BSC's certified
estimate of 1100 cubic yards per year of stabilized filter cake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not generally verify submitted test data before proposing delisting decisions. The sworn affidavit submitted
with this petition binds the petitioner to present truthful and accurate results. The Agency, however, has maintained
a spot-check sampling and analysis program to verify the representative nature of the data for some percentage of
the submitted petitions. A spot-check visit to a selected facility may be initiated before finalizing a delisting
petition or after granting a final exclusion. The Agency was present at BSC's Sparrow Point facility to observe the
collection of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake samples on January 23, 1992.

The Agency considered the appropriateness of alternative waste management scenarios for BSC's chemically stabilized
filter cake and decided, based on the information provided in the petition, that disposal in a municipal solid waste
landfill is the most reasonable, worst-case scenario for this waste. Under a landfill disposal scenario, the major
exposure route of concern for any hazardous constituents would be ingestion of contaminated ground water. The Agency,
therefore, evaluated BSC's petitioned waste using the modified EPA Composite Model for Landfills (EPACML) which
predicts the potential for ground-water contamination from wastes that are landfilled. See 56 FR 32993 (July 18,
1991), 56 FR 67197 (December 30, 1991), and the RCRA public docket for these notices for a detailed description of the
EPACML model, the disposal assumptions, and the modifications made for delisting. This model, which includes both
unsaturated and saturated zone transport modules, was used to predict reasonable worst-case contaminant levels
in ground water at a compliance point (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a receptor well serving as a drinking-water supply). Specifically, the model estimated the dilution/attenuation
factor (DAF) resulting from subsurface processes such as three-dimensional dispersion and dilution from ground-water
recharge for a specific volume of waste. The Agency requests comments on the use of the EPACML as applied to the evaluation
of BSC's petitioned waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the evaluation of BSC's petitioned waste, the Agency used the EPACML to evaluate the mobility of the hazardous
inorganic constituents detected in the extract from BSC's stabilized filter cake. The Agency's evaluation, using
a maximum annual waste volume estimate of 1100 cubic yards per year and the maximum reported or calculated EP, TCLP,
or MEP leachate concentrations (see Tables 2 and 3), yielded compliance-point concentrations (see Table 4) that
are orders of magnitude below the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making. Maximum leachable levels
from both uncured and cured stabilized waste were below levels of concern.

levels used in delisting decision-making. The Agency did not evaluate the mobility of the remaining inorganic constituents
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, cadmium, silver, and cyanide) from BSC's waste because they were not detected in the leachate using the appropriate
analytical test methods (see Tables 2 and 3). The Agency believes that it is inappropriate to evaluate non-detectable
concentrations of a constituent of concern in its modeling efforts if the non-detectable value was obtained using
the appropriate analytical method. If a constituent cannot be detected (when using the appropriate analytical method
with an adequate detection limit), the Agency assumes that the constituent is not present and therefore does not present
a threat to either human health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As also reported in Table 1, the maximum concentration of total cyanide in BSC's stabilized filter cake is 52 ppm. Because
reactive cyanide is a specific subcategory of the general class of cyanide compounds, the maximum level of reactive
cyanide will not exceed 52 ppm. Thus, the Agency concludes that the concentration of reactive cyanide will be below
the Agency's interim standard of 250 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,'' July 12, 1985,
internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. Lastly, because the total constituent concentration of sulfide
in the stabilized filter cake is 160 ppm (see Table 1), the Agency believes that the concentration of reactive sulfide
will be below the Agency's interim standard of 500 ppm. See ``Interim Agency Thresholds for Toxic Gas Generation,''
July 12, 1985, internal Agency Memorandum in the RCRA public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, chloroform was detected in the TCLP extracts of unstabilized waste, and also in one of the method
blanks. Thus, the presence of chloroform is uncertain and may be attributed to laboratory contamination. However,
the Agency also used the EPACML to evaluate the mobility of chloroform detected in the extract from BSC's dewatered
(unstabilized) filter cake as a worst-case analysis of this constituent. The Agency's evaluation, using a maximum
annual waste volume estimate of 1100 cubic yards per year and a maximum leachate concentration of 0.0624 ppm, yielded
a compliance-point concentration of 0.0006 ppm. Thus, even under these worst-case assumptions, this concentration
is less than the delisting health-based level for chloroform of 0.006 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency concluded, after reviewing BSC's processes and raw materials list, that no other hazardous constituents
of concern, other than those tested for, are being used by BSC and that no other constituents of concern are likely to
be present or formed as reaction products or by-products in BSC's waste. In addition, on the basis of explanations
provided by BSC, pursuant to &sect;260.22, the Agency concludes that the waste does not exhibit any of the characteristics
of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See &sect;261.21, &sect;261.22, and &sect;261.23, respectively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its evaluation of BSC's petition, the Agency also considered the potential impact of the petitioned waste
via non-ground water routes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 air emission and surface runoff). With regard to airborne dispersal in particular, the Agency believes that exposure
to airborne contaminants from BSC's stabilized waste is unlikely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSC's dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake is composed of metal hydroxides, primarily chromic hydroxide, which
is one of the more stable wastes in the environment. BSC's dewatered filter cake will then be stabilized through the
pozzolanic reaction of lime and fly ash, which adsorbs and binds the heavy metals present in the chromium filter cake
into a calcium-alumino-silicate matrix, thereby rendering them essentially immobile. The stabilization product
will ultimately cure into a concrete-like solid material. Therefore, EPA does not believe that airborne exposure
to hazardous contaminants released from BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake is likely to present a hazard to
human health. In addition, there are no significant volatile constituents of concern present in the filter cake for
that could lead to airborne exposure to any organic constituent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency evaluated the potential hazards resulting from the unlikely scenario of airborne exposure to
hazardous constituents released from BSC's waste in an open landfill. The results of this worst-case analysis indicated
that no substantial present or potential hazard to human health from exposure to particulate emissions from BSC's
waste is likely. A description of the Agency's assessment of the potential impact of BSC's waste, with regard to airborne
dispersal of waste contaminants, is presented in the docket for today's proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also considered the potential impact of the petitioned wastes via a surface water route. Because BSC's
waste will be stabilized in a solidified form, contamination of surface water is unlikely to occur through particulate
runoff from a landfill containing the BSC's waste. The Agency also believes that containment structures at municipal
solid waste landfills can effectively control surface water run-off, as the recently promulgated Subtitle D regulations
(see 56 FR 50978, October 9, 1991) prohibit pollutant discharges into surface waters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the concentrations of any hazardous constituents dissolved in the runoff will tend to be lower than
the levels in either the TCLP or MEP leachate analyses reported in today's notice, due to the aggressive acid medium
used for extraction in the TCLP and MEP tests. The Agency believes that, in general, leachate derived from the waste
is unlikely to directly enter a surface water body without first travelling through the saturated subsurface zone
where further dilution and attenuation of hazardous constituents will also occur. Significant releases to surface
water through erosion and runoff of landfilled BSC's waste are unlikely due to the solidified concrete form of the
waste. Furthermore, in the unlikely event that BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake reached surface water, the
stabilized form of the waste would mitigate any impact. Leachable concentrations provide a direct measure of the
solubility of a toxic constituent in water, and are indicative of the fraction of the constituent that may be mobilized
in surface water, as well as ground water. The reported TCLP and MEP extraction data show that the metals in BSC's chemically
stabilized filter cake are essentially immobile in aqueous solution. For example, the maximum leachable chromium
level was 0.10 ppm, which is less than 0.0002% of the chromium present in BSC's chemically stabilized filter cake.
Therefore, BSC's waste that might be released to surface water would be likely to remain undissolved. Finally, any
transported constituents would be further diluted in the receiving surface water body due to relatively large flows
of the streams/rivers of concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the reasons discussed above, EPA believes that contamination of surface water through run-off from the waste
disposal area is very unlikely. Nevertheless, the Agency evaluated potential impacts on surface water if BSC's waste
were released from a municipal solid waste landfill through run off and erosion (see the docket for today's proposed
rule). The estimated levels of the hazardous constituents of concern in surface water would be well below health-based
levels for human health, as well as below the EPA Chronic Water Quality Criteria for aquatic organisms (USEPA, OWRS,
1987). The Agency, therefore, concluded that BSC's chemically stabilized waste is not a substantial present or potential
hazard to human health and environment via the surface water exposure pathway.

E. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that BSC's descriptions of its stabilization process and its characterization of waste composition,
in conjunction with the proposed delisting testing requirements, provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the
likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the petitioned waste will be substantially reduced, and
thus, that BSC's petition for an upfront conditional exclusion should be granted. The Agency believes that the sampling
procedures used by BSC were adequate, and that the samples are representative of the day-to-day variations in constituent
concentrations found in the stabilized filter cake. The Agency believes that data submitted in support of the petition
show that BSC's proposed stabilization process can render the dewatered filter cake immobile and non-hazardous.
In addition, under the testing provisions of the conditional exclusion, BSC will be required to re-treat or dispose
of as hazardous any batch exhibiting extract levels at or above a specified level (

). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposes to grant a conditional, upfront exclusion to Bethlehem Steel Corporation, located in Sparrows
Point, Maryland, for the stabilized filter cake described in its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. The Agency's
decision to exclude this waste is based on process descriptions, characterization of dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake, and results from the analysis of waste subjected to BSC's proposed stabilization process. If the proposed
rule is finalized, the petitioned stabilized filter cake, provided the conditions of the exclusion are met, will
no longer be subject to regulation under Parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standards of Part 270. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

F. Verification Testing Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, verification tests are to be conducted in two phases, initial and subsequent. The initial testing requirements
apply to at least the first eight weeks that BSC stabilizes its dewatered filter cake as described in its petition.
Upon approval by EPA, the subsequent testing requirements apply to the stabilized waste generated after the initial
verification testing period. The proposed conditions also include an annual testing requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final exclusion is granted as proposed, BSC will be required both to verify that the treatment system is on-line
and operating as described in the petition, and to show that, once on-line, the stabilized filter cake continues to
meet the Agency's verification testing limitations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``delisting levels''). These proposed conditions are specific to the upfront exclusion petitioned for by BSC. The
Agency may choose to modify these proposed conditions based on comments that may be received during the public comment
period for this proposed rule. This proposed exclusion for BSC's stabilized filter cake is conditional upon the following
requirements:

Testing:

 Sample collection and analyses (including quality control (QC) procedures) must be performed according to SW&hyph;846
methodologies. If EPA judges the stabilization process to be effective under the conditions used during the initial
verification testing, BSC may replace the testing required in Condition (1)(A) with the testing required in Condition
(1)(B). BSC must continue to test as specified in Condition (1)(A) until and unless notified by EPA in writing that
testing in Condition (1)(A) may be replaced by Condition (1)(B) (to the extent directed by EPA).

Initial Verification Testing:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 During at least the first eight weeks of operation of the full-scale treatment system, BSC must collect and analyze
weekly composites representative of the stabilized waste. Weekly composites must be composed of representative
grab samples collected from every batch during each week of stabilization. The composite samples must be collected
and analyzed, prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake, for all constituents listed in Condition (3). BSC
must report the analytical test data, including a record of the ratios of lime kiln dust and fly ash used and quality
control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 60 days after the collection of the last composite
of stabilized filter cake.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has determined, based on the generation rate of stabilized filter cake, that approximately eight weeks
would be required for BSC to collect sufficient data to verify that a full-scale stabilization process is operating
correctly. The proposed initial testing condition, if promulgated, will require BSC to collect a minimum of eight
composite samples during the first eight weeks that BSC stabilizes its dewatered filter cake. The Agency believes
that proposed initial verification testing is appropriate, because the volume of dewatered (unstabilized) filter
cake to be generated daily is relatively small, and hazardous constituents in the filter cake become immobile after
chemical stabilization. This initial testing condition would ensure that the full-scale treatment system is closely
monitored during the start-up period. If the Agency determines that the data collected under this condition reveal
that the treatment system is not being operated as described in BSC's petition, the exclusion will not cover the generated
stabilized filter cake. If the Agency determines that the data obtained from the initial verification period demonstrates
the treatment process is effective, EPA will notify BSC in writing that the testing conditions in (1)(A) may be replaced
with the testing conditions in (1)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the concentrations of the constituents of concern in the stabilized filter cake may vary
somewhat over time. Based on information BSC provided in its petition, total chromium concentrations in the dewatered
(unstabilized) filter cake range from 7.75 percent to 24 percent. To ensure that BSC's stabilization process effectively
handles the variation in chromium concentration in the dewatered filter cake, the Agency is proposing a subsequent
verification testing condition. In addition to chromium, low leachable concentrations of lead and nickel were found
in unstabilized and stabilized filter cake. Thus, the proposed subsequent testing would demonstrate that the stabilization
process is operating as described in the petition and that the stabilized filter cake does not exhibit unacceptable
levels of key toxic constituents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, chromium, lead, and nickel). Therefore, the Agency is proposing to require BSC to analyze monthly composites of
the stabilized filter cake as described in Condition (1)(B).

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Subsequent Verification Testing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: Following written notification by EPA, BSC may substitute the testing condition in (1)(B) for (1)(A). BSC must collect
and analyze at least one composite representative of the stabilized filter cake generated each month. Monthly composites
must be comprised of representative samples collected from all batches that are stabilized in a one-month period.
The monthly samples must be analyzed prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake for chromium, lead and nickel.
BSC may, at its discretion, analyze composite samples more frequently to demonstrate that smaller batches of waste
are non-hazardous.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is also proposing to require BSC to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that the characteristics of the petitioned
waste remain as originally described. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to require BSC to analyze, on an annual basis,
a representative composite sample of the stabilized filter cake for all Toxicity Characteristic (TC) constituents
as described in Condition (1)(C).

Annual Verification Testing:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to confirm that the characteristics of the waste do not change significantly over time, BSC must, on an annual
basis, analyze a representative composite sample of stabilized filter cake for all TC constituents listed in 40 CFR
&sect;261.24 using the method specified therein. This composite sample must represent the stabilized filter cake
generated over one week.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that collecting monthly composite samples will ensure that BSC's stabilization process is not
adversely affected by the potential variability in concentrations of chromium, lead and nickel. The data obtained
from the annual recharacterization of the petitioned waste will assist EPA in determining whether the petitioned
waste is more variable than originally described by the petitioner. The Agency also believes that the annual recharacterization
of the petitioned waste is not overly burdensome to the petitioner and notes that these data will assist the petitioner
in complying with &sect;262.11(c) which requires generators to determine whether their wastes are hazardous, as
defined by the Toxicity Characteristic (see &sect;261.24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future delisting proposals and decisions issued by the Agency may include different testing and reporting requirements
based on an evaluation of the manufacturing and treatment processes, the waste, the volume of waste (including whether
there is a fixed volume of waste), and other factors normally considered in the petition review process. For example,
wastes with variable constituent concentrations, discussed in previous delisting decisions (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 56 FR 41286, August 20, 1991, and 56 FR 67197, December 30, 1991), may require more frequent and more extensive continuous
batch testing.

Waste Holding and Handling

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: BSC must store, as hazardous, all stabilized filter cake generated until verification testing (as specified in
Conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B)) is completed and valid analyses demonstrate that the delisting levels set forth in
Condition (3) are met. If the levels of hazardous constituents measured in the samples of stabilized filter cake generated
are below all of the levels set forth in Condition (3), then the stabilized filter cake is non-hazardous and may be managed
and disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If hazardous constituent levels in any
weekly or monthly composite sample equal or exceed any of the delisting levels set in Condition (3), the stabilized
filter cake generated during the time period corresponding to this sample must be retreated until it is below these
levels or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Condition (2) is to ensure that stabilized filter cake which contains hazardous levels of specific
constituents is managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA. Holding the stabilized filter cake
until characterization is complete will protect against improper handling of hazardous material. The stabilized
samples must be analyzed for the appropriate parameters, and must meet the appropriate delisting levels in Condition
(3), in order for the waste to be excluded from the hazardous waste regulatory system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency selected the set of constituents specified in Condition (3) after reviewing information about the composition
of BSC's unstabilized and stabilized F006 filter cake and descriptions of BSC's manufacturing and treatment processes.
The analytes in Condition (3) include TC metallic constituents currently regulated under &sect;261.24 and nickel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency established the delisting levels by first back-calculating the maximum allowable leachate concentrations
(MALs) from the health-based levels (HBLs) for the constituents of concern using the EPACML DAF of 96 for BSC's maximum
annual stabilized waste volume of 1,100 cubic yards, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, MAL=HBL &times; DAF. The calculated MALs were then compared with the maximum contaminant concentrations for the
toxicity characteristic (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, TC levels) shown in &sect;261.24, as &sect;260.22(d)(3) precludes delisting any waste that exhibits a characteristic.
The delisting levels established in Condition (3) are the lesser of the calculated MALs and the TC levels. Delisting
levels are set at the TC levels for selenium, barium, chromium, and silver.

As to the (those) identified section(s) of this document for which I cannot personally verify its (their) truth and
accuracy, I certify as the company official having supervisory responsibility for the persons who, acting under
my direct instructions, made the verification that this information is true, accurate and complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that any of this information is determined by EPA in its sole discretion to be false, inaccurate or incomplete,
and upon conveyance of this fact to the company, I recognize and agree that this exclusion of waste will be void as if
it never had effect or to the extent directed by EPA and that the company will be liable for any actions taken in contravention
of the company's RCRA and CERCLA obligations premised upon the company's reliance on the void exclusion.''

If made final, the proposed exclusion will apply only to the stabilized filter cake generated during the treatment
of dewatered filter cake produced by BSC's Sparrows Point, Maryland facility. In addition, if made final the exclusion
will apply only to the processes and waste volume (a maximum of 1100 cubic yards of stabilized filter cake generated
annually) covered by the original demonstration. The facility would require a new exclusion if either its manufacturing
or treatment processes are significantly altered beyond the changes in operating conditions described in Condition
(4), such that an adverse change in waste composition (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if levels of hazardous constituents increased significantly) or increase in waste volume occurred. Accordingly,
the facility would need to file a new petition for the altered waste. The facility must treat stabilized filter cake
generated either in excess of 1100 cubic yards per year or from changed processes as hazardous until a new exclusion
is granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although management of the waste covered by this petition would be relieved from subtitle C jurisdiction upon final
promulgation of an exclusion, the generator of a delisted waste must either treat, store, or dispose of the waste in
an on-site facility, or ensure that the waste is delivered to an off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility,
either of which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively,
the delisted waste may be delivered to a facility that beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or reclaims
the waste, or treats the waste prior to such beneficial use, reuse, recycling, or reclamation.

III. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule, if made final, will become effective immediately upon final publication. The Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated
community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here, because this rule, if finalized,
would reduce the existing requirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardship
and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective date six months after publication and the fact
that a six-month deadline is not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA believes that this exclusion
should be effective immediately upon final publication. These reasons also provide a basis for making this rule effective
immediately, upon final publication, under the Administrative Procedure Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).

IV. Regulatory Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must conduct an ``assessment of the potential costs and benefits'' for all ``significant''
regulatory actions. This proposal to grant an exclusion is not significant, since its effect, if promulgated, would
be to reduce the overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction
would be achieved by excluding waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby
enabling this facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additional impact due to today's rule. Therefore,
this proposal would not be a significant regulation, and no cost/benefit assessment is required. The Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) has also exempted this rule from the requirement for OMB review under section (6) of Executive Order
12866.

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory
flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis
is required, however, if the Administrator or delegated representative certifies that the rule will not have any
impact on any small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule, if promulgated, will not have any adverse economic impact on any small entities since its effect would be
to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardous waste regulations and would be limited to one facility. Accordingly,
I hereby certify that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Testing:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sample collection and analyses (including quality control (QC) procedures) must be performed according to SW&hyph;846
methodologies. If EPA judges the stabilization process to be effective under the conditions used during the initial
verification testing, BSC may replace the testing required in Condition (1)(A) with the testing required in Condition
(1)(B). BSC must continue to test as specified in Condition (1)(A) until and unless notified by EPA in writing that
testing in Condition (1)(A) may be replaced by Condition (1)(B) (to the extent directed by EPA).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 -->
 During at least the first eight weeks of operation of the full-scale treatment system, BSC must collect and analyze
weekly composites representative of the stabilized waste. Weekly composites must be composed of representative
grab samples collected from every batch during each week of stabilization. The composite samples must be collected
and analyzed, prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake, for all constituents listed in Condition (3). BSC
must report the analytical test data, including a record of the ratios of lime kiln dust and fly ash used and quality
control information, obtained during this initial period no later than 60 days after the collection of the last composite
of stabilized filter cake.

 Following written notification by EPA, BSC may substitute the testing condition in (1)(B) for (1)(A). BSC must collect
and analyze at least one composite representative of the stabilized filter cake generated each month. Monthly composites
must be comprised of representative samples collected from all batches that are stabilized in a one-month period.
The monthly samples must be analyzed prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake for chromium, lead and nickel.
BSC may, at its discretion, analyze composite samples more frequently to demonstrate that smaller batches of waste
are non-hazardous.

 In order to confirm that the characteristics of the waste do not change significantly over time, BSC must, on an annual
basis, analyze a representative composite sample of stabilized filter cake for all TC constituents listed in 40 CFR
261.24 using the method specified therein. This composite sample must represent the stabilized filter cake generated
over one week.

 BSC must store, as hazardous, all stabilized filter cake generated until verification testing (as specified in Conditions
(1)(A) and (1)(B)) is completed and valid analyses demonstrate that the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3)
are met. If the levels of hazardous constituents measured in the samples of stabilized filter cake generated are below
all the levels set forth in Condition (3), then the stabilized filter cake is non-hazardous and may be managed and disposed
of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If hazardous constituent levels in any weekly or monthly
composite sample equal or exceed any of the delisting levels set in Condition (3), the stabilized filter cake generated
during the time period corresponding to this sample must be retreated until it is below these levels or managed and
disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (no common name), a plant endemic to the island of Hawaii, Hawaiian Islands, as an endangered species under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). Additional field surveys have provided new information revealing that
the species has a wider distribution than previously known. The Service has considered the additional information
and determined that this species is not likely to become either endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant
portion of its range in the foreseeable future, and it does not qualify for listing under the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hesperocnide sandwicensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Commercial King and
Tanner Crab Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI). This FMP amendment would establish the Norton
Sound Section of the Northern District of the king crab fishery as a superexclusive registration area. If this amendment
is approved, existing regulations, which supersede State of Alaska (State) regulations that establish Norton Sound
as a superexclusive registration area in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the BSAI, will be removed and reserved.
This action is necessary for the effective management of the fishery having the smallest biomass and guideline harvest
level (GHL) in the BSAI crab fisheries. This action is intended to promote management and conservation of crab and
other fishery resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner
Crab Fisheries of the BSAI.

 Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires the Secretary
to publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time,
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent
with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making
that determination, will take into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period.

The commercial king and Tanner crab fisheries in the EEZ of the BSAI are managed under the FMP. This FMP was prepared
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act). It is a framework FMP that, with oversight by the Council and Secretary, defers management of the
crab resources in the BSAI to the State. The FMP was approved by the Secretary and implemented on June 2, 1989. At times,
regulations implementing the FMP must be amended to resolve problems pertaining to management of the BSAI crab fisheries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's Board of Fisheries (Board) formulates regulations to manage the crab fisheries under procedures specified
in the State's Administrative Procedure Act. On February 8, 1993, the Board established Norton Sound in the BSAI as
a superexclusive registration area for purposes of managing the Norton Sound red king crab fishery. The operator
of any vessel registered in a superexclusive area would not be able to register the vessel in any other area during that
registration year. This management measure was proposed to address the unique collection of problems that make fishery
management difficult in Norton Sound. The problems are associated with conservation and management of a fishery
with a small biomass, small guideline harvest level (GHL), and a stock on the edge of its geographic range, which makes
it biologically sensitive. The problems include overcapitalization, short seasons, high management costs, and
both over-harvest and under-harvest of GHLs. Historically, the fishery has been characterized by years with low
levels of participation and fairly high catch rates followed by years with high levels of participation and low catch
rates. A combination of factors has led to high participation, which is expected to continue into the future. These
factors are primarily the overcapitalized crab fleet and participants' efforts to establish catch histories in
the event individual fishing quotas (IFQs) are instituted. Superexclusive registration would be expected to create
a management environment discouraging participation by large crab vessels and catcher/processors. Probable results
are a slower-paced fishery, fuller attainment of GHLs, a longer season, and reduced administrative and enforcement
costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alaska Crab Coalition (ACC) appealed the State's designation of Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration
area. Following Secretarial review of the State's action, the Secretary issued an interim final rule that superseded
State regulations establishing Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area in the EEZ of the BSAI (58 FR 38727,
July 20, 1993). This action was necessary because the Secretary had determined that designation of superexclusive
registration areas was inconsistent with provisions of the FMP. The FMP contains three categories of management
measures: (1) Specific Federal management measures that require an FMP amendment to change; (2) framework type management
measures, with criteria set out in the FMP that the State must follow when implementing changes in State regulations;
and (3) measures that are neither rigidly specified nor frameworked in the FMP, and which may be freely adopted or modified
by the State, subject to an appeals process or other Federal laws. Registration areas are listed as a Category 2 measure.
Section 8.2.8 of the FMP specifies that king crab registration areas may be designated as either exclusive or nonexclusive.
Designation of a registration area as superexclusive would require an FMP amendment and incorporation into the FMP
as a Category 1 management measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1993, the Council requested proposals for possible amendments to the FMP. On August 13, 1993, the Board submitted
a proposal to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. This proposal was reviewed by the crab
FMP plan team, which ranked it as a high priority and recommended it to the Council for consideration. At its September
1993 meetings, the Council recommended analysis of the Board's proposal. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G)
and NMFS prepared a draft analysis for the proposed FMP amendment to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration
area. The draft analysis was reviewed by the Council and its Advisory Panel (AP) and Scientific and Statistical Committee
(SSC) during the Council's December 1993 meetings and adopted for public review. At its January 1994 meetings, the
Council considered the testimony and recommendations of the AP, SSC, fishing industry representatives and the general
public on the proposed action to designate Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area. The Council adopted
the proposed action under Amendment 2 to the FMP and requested NMFS to remove existing regulations at 50 CFR 671.20,
which supersede existing State regulations designating Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area.

NMFS prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have significant
effects on small entities. Overall, superexclusive registration area designation likely will result in a transfer
of participation and income from a predominantly large-vessel fleet to a predominantly small-vessel fleet. Twenty-six
vessels registered and fished in Norton Sound in 1992, and Norton Sound crab contributed no more than 0.7 percent to
any of these vessels' crab landings for the year. Norton Sound crab contributed no more than 1.6 percent of the total
for any of the catcher/processors in 1990. Neither operators of individual vessels nor participants in the pre-1993
fleet were dependent on this fishery in terms of year-to-year participation or landings within any one year.

Not knowing the outcome of the ACC's appeal and Secretarial review, many vessel owners chose not to register for the
Norton Sound fishery in 1993. Twenty-eight percent of the vessels that were registered were from the local region.
A new fresh market for summer king crab was developed and resulted in higher ex-vessel prices than that received for
crab that are processed and frozen. Local residents are maintaining plans to develop this market further. Most of
the fishermen on the small vessels are expected to be unemployed if they do not participate in this fishery. The infusion
of employment and income from the 1993 small vessel fishery was significant in the Nome area. The 1993 king crab fishery
represented the largest fishery in the region in terms of income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Superexclusive registration is predicted to result in an increase in retained revenues and possibly to improve market
conditions for increasing overall revenues. It is expected to reduce industry compliance costs. The economic impact
on small entities under the proposed action would not result in a reduction in annual gross revenues of more than 5 percent,
annual compliance costs that increased total costs of production by more than 5 percent, or compliance costs for small
entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent of sales for large entities. A copy of
this analysis is available from the Council (see

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for certain major
household appliances, and requires the Department of Energy (DOE or Department) to administer an energy conservation
program for these products. The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act amendments require DOE to consider amending
the energy conservation standards for room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home
furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters and fluorescent lamp ballasts; and to consider establishing energy
conservation standards for television sets.

Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation
standards. The Department, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required
to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. The purpose
of the test procedures is to produce test results that measure the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual
operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use and shall not be unduly
burdensome to conduct. Section 323 (b)(3). A test procedure is not required if DOE determines by rule that one cannot
be developed. Section 323 (d)(1). Test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Trade Commission is required by the Act to prescribe rules governing the labeling of covered products
for which test procedures have been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules are to require that each particular
model of a covered product bears a label that indicates its annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual
operating costs for other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). Disclosure of estimated operating cost is not
required under section 324 if the Federal Trade Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist
consumers in making purchasing decisions, or is not economically feasible. In such a case, the Federal Trade Commission
must require a different useful measure of energy consumption. Section 324(c). At the present time there are Federal
Trade Commission rules requiring labels for the following products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers,
dishwashers, water heaters, refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, central air conditioners and
central air conditioning heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979, 52 FR 46888, December
10, 1987, and 54 FR 28031, July 5, 1989.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of the 12 covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federal energy conservation standard. Section
325(b)-(h). The Act establishes dates of applicability for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on
the product, and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by the Department within 3 to 10 years, also depending
on the product. Section 325(b)-(h). After the specified period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product;
however, the Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use,
or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency of a covered product. Section 325(l)(1). The Department's current
review of standards is for room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces,
kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters and fluorescent lamp ballasts and is considering establishing energy conservation
standards for television sets. Section 325(g)(4)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency
that is technologically feasible and economically justified. Section 325(l)(2)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standard is economically justified, it must
first solicit comments on a proposed standard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determine
that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatest extent practicable, on a weighing of the
following seven factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class)
compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products
which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of
the standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to
result from the imposition of the standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The need for national energy conservation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 325(l)(2)(B)(iii) establishes a rebuttable presumption of economic justification in instances
where the Secretary determines that ``the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with
an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy savings during the first
year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure*&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules on State laws or regulations concerning testing, labeling,
and standards. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the Act. Section 327(a)-(c). Exemptions
to this general rule include: (1) State standards prescribed or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to
appliances produced before January 3, 1988 (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards which are more
stringent than the applicable Federal standard (Section 327(b)(3) and (f)(1)-(4)); (3) State regulations banning
constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters (Section 327(b)(4)); and (4) State standards for television sets effective
on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal standard for such product (Section 327(b)(6)
and 327(c)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Energy Conservation Policy Act required DOE to establish mandatory energy efficiency standards for
each of the 13 covered products.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 These standards were to be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that was technologically
feasible and economically justified.

The consumer products covered by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act included: Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers;
freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipment not including
furnaces; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; humidifiers and dehumidifiers; central
air conditioners; and furnaces.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Energy Conservation Policy Act provided, however, that no standard for a product be established if there
were no test procedure for the product, or if DOE determined by rule either that a standard would not result in significant
conservation of energy, or that a standard was not technologically feasible or economically justified. In determining
whether a standard was economically justified, the Department was directed to determine whether the benefits of
the standard exceeded its burdens by weighing the seven factors discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which became law on March 17, 1987, amended the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act in part by: redefining ``covered products'' (specifically, refrigerators, refrigerator- freezers,
and freezers were combined into one product type from two; humidifiers and dehumidifiers were deleted; and pool heaters
were added); establishing Federal energy conservation standards for 11 of the 12 covered products; and creating
a schedule, according to which each standard is to be reviewed to determine if an amended standard is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, which became law on June 28, 1988, established Federal
energy conservation standards for fluorescent lamp ballasts. These amendments also created a review schedule for
DOE to determine if any amended standard for fluorescent lamp ballasts is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Energy Policy Act of 1992, which became law on October 24, 1992, addressed various commercial appliances and equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As directed by the Act, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with a 75-day comment period that ended
December 12, 1990, for the eight products subject to today's rulemaking. 55 FR 39624, September 28, 1990. (Hereafter
referred to as the September 1990 advance notice). The September 1990 advance notice presented the product classes
that DOE planned to analyze, and provided a detailed discussion of the analytical methodology and analytical models
that the Department expected to use in performing the analysis to support this rulemaking. The Department invited
comments and data on the accuracy and feasibility of the planned methodology and encouraged interested persons to
recommend improvements or alternatives to the Department's approach. The comments in response to the advance notice
are addressed in Sections II and III of this notice.

a. Energy Descriptors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the Act established initial energy conservation standards for all of the covered products except
television sets. Some of these standards were of a prescriptive form, such as the requirement of a no heat dry option
for dishwashers, and others were performance standards, stated in terms of an energy descriptor, such as seasonal
energy efficiency ratio for central air conditioners, annual fuel utilization factor for furnaces, etc. The intent
of these standards, and the subsequent required DOE analyses and rulemaking regarding amending the standards, is
to save energy. In conducting rulemakings and analyses required by the Act to determine if standards should be amended,
the Department previously determined that the form of a standard may need to change in order to evaluate the efficiency
standards. For example, the final rule issued for dishwashers changed the standard from the initial prescriptive
standard to a performance standard based on an energy descriptor. 56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991. Additionally, the Department
has determined in this rulemaking that energy descriptors may need to be changed when it is found they do not account
for all of the energy or all types of energy consumed by an appliance. Not to change these energy descriptors would result
in an incomplete analysis and could lead to standards being met by utilizing unaccounted energy resulting in products
that might satisfy the energy descriptor but result in little or no total energy savings. Examples of unaccounted
energy are the pilot light energy of a pool heater which is not accounted for by the current energy descriptor of Thermal
Efficiency or the electrical fan energy of a gas furnace which is not accounted for by the current energy descriptor
of the annual fuel utilization factor. Accordingly, the Department is proposing in today's notice to change the energy
descriptors of the initial standards for direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, and pool heaters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each product discussed in today's proposed rulemaking there is an applicable DOE test procedure to evaluate its
energy efficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would amend the test procedures for mobile home furnaces, direct heating equipment,
and pool heaters was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44538); in addition, another Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which includes amendments to
the test procedures for clothes washers, water heaters, ranges and ovens is being published.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For those products and classes of products discussed in today's notice, DOE believes that the efficiency levels analyzed,
while not necessarily being realized in production, are technologically possible. The technological feasibility
of the design options are addressed in the product-specific discussion. The Department's criteria for evaluating
design options for technological feasibility are that the design options are already in use by the respective industry,
or that research has progressed to the development of a prototype.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires the Department, in considering any new or amended standards, to consider those that ``shall be designed
to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible
and economically justified.'' (Section 325 (l)(2)(A)). Accordingly, for each class of product under consideration
in this rulemaking, a maximum technologically feasible (max tech) design option was identified. The max tech level
is one that can be carried out by the addition of design options, both commercially feasible and prototypes, to the
baseline units.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Department believes that in identifying the max tech level a unit must be capable of being assembled, but not necessarily
mass produced, by the effective date of the amended standards. Manufacturing ability is determined under economic
justification. For example, in the November 1989 Final Rule, DOE concluded that evacuated panels for refrigerators
was a technically feasible design option since refrigerators had been produced on a limited scale with this technology
included. However, DOE concluded that this technology was not economically justified because the chemical industry
would not be able to make sufficient quantities of the raw materials commercially available by the effective date
of the standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The baseline unit is the most commonly used combination of engineering design options which are found in appliances
that meet the existing National Appliance Energy Conservation Act standards except for television sets where no
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act standard exists. In the case of television sets, the baseline is represented
by the typical 19/20
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->

&rsquo; television with electronic tuning and remote control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The max tech levels were derived by adding energy-conserving engineering design options to the respective classes
in order of decreasing consumer payback. For example, the max tech level for room air conditioners includes higher
efficiency fan motors, which were added early, and variable speed compressors, which were added later because of
their slower payback. A complete discussion of each max tech level, and the design options included in each, is found
in the

The Department believes that these are the max tech levels from an engineering analysis standpoint. Each of the levels
was evaluated in accordance with the economic justification factors specified in the Act to determine economic justification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department evaluated each max tech level to determine if it would be economically justified at the time the standards
would become effective. The Department rejected energy conservation standards that had unacceptable impacts on
consumers or manufacturers (e.g., unusually long payback periods and substantially adverse impacts on manufacturers'
returns on equity).

1. Determination of Savings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Department forecasted energy consumption through the use of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy
Model, which forecasted energy consumption over the period of analysis for candidate standards and the base case.
The Department quantified the energy savings that would be attributable to a standard as the difference in energy
consumption between the candidate standard's case and the base case. The base case represents the forecasts of outputs,
e.g., prices, operating expenses, energy consumption, shipments, and manufacturer impacts in the absence of new
or amended standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model was used by DOE in previous standards rulemakings. The
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model is explained in the Technical Support Document accompanying
this notice. (See Appendix B to that document for a detailed discussion of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential
Energy Model.) The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model contains algorithms to project average
efficiencies, usage behavior, and market shares for each product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COMMEND is the Commercial Energy End-Use Model. It was developed by the Electric Power Research Institute, to characterize
energy end-use in the commercial sector. For this rulemaking, the Commercial Energy End-Use Model is being used to
evaluate more stringent standards on fluorescent lamp ballasts, which are found principally in the commercial sector
of the economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market share calculations contain the following steps: potential purchasers may purchase any competing technology
within an end-use, or none. For room air conditioners, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets, the decision
to purchase or not is modeled, and the fraction of the total that chooses each class, e.g., F40T12 lamps, F96T12 lamps,
etc., is specified exogenously. For the other products, along with the considerations above, the choice of fuel is
modeled. Long-term market share elasticities have been assumed with respect to equipment price, operating expense,
and income. The effects of standards are expected to be lower operating expense and increased equipment price. The
percentage changes in these quantities are used, together with the elasticities, to determine changes in sales volumes
resulting from standards. Higher equipment prices will decrease sales volumes, while lower operating expenses
will increase them. The net result depends on the standard level selected, and associated equipment prices and operating
expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model and the Commercial Energy End-Use Model (for ballasts
only) are used to project energy use over the relevant time periods for seven of these products with and without amended
standards, and, in the case of televisions, with and without standards. By comparing the energy consumption projection
at alternative standard levels with the legislated standards, the Department estimated the amount of energy projected
to be saved during the period 1996&hyph;2030.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The energy saved is expressed in quads, i.e., quadrillions of British thermal units (Btu). With respect to electricity,
the savings are quads of source or primary energy, which is the energy necessary to generate and transmit electricity.
The Act defines ``energy use'' as the quantity of energy directly consumed by a consumer product at point of use. This
is generally called ``site'' energy, as opposed to ``source'' energy. There are major differences between these
types of energy. From data that remains rather constant over the years, the amount of electrical energy consumed at
the site is less than one-third of the amount of source energy that is required to generate and transmit the site electrical
energy.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, it is important to identify whether the electricity involved is site or source energy.

Lawrence Berkeley-Laboratory Residential Energy Model and the Commercial Energy End-Use Model were programmed
to analyze a single standard level or alternate standard levels over the entire period. That is, the fact that a standard
might be revised during subsequent rulemakings was not considered by the model. The Department believes that it is
not possible to predict what result such reviews may have, and therefore it would be speculative to model any particular
result. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking, each standard level that was analyzed was projected to have been
in place from the time of implementation to the year 2030.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model projections are dependent on many assumptions. Among
the most important are responsiveness of household appliance purchasers to changes in residential energy prices
and consumer income, future energy prices, future levels of housing construction, and options that exist for improving
the energy efficiency of appliances. The Commercial Energy End-Use Model projections are dependent upon changes
in commercial energy prices, future construction of commercial floorspace, responsiveness of building owners
to future energy and equipment prices and to utility demand-side management programs, and options for improving
the energy efficiency of lighting. As is the case with any complicated computer model simulation, the validity of
the outputs is critically dependent on the inputs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under section 325(l)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department is prohibited from adopting a standard for a product if that
standard would not result in ``significant'' energy savings. While the term ``significant'' has never been defined

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act established new criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for determining whether a standard level is economically justified. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
325(l)(2)(B)(iii) states:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level will be less than three times the value of the energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether a standard is economically justified.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the increase in initial price of an appliance due to a conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard would repay itself to the consumer in energy savings in less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three years, then it is presumed that such standard is economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 This presumption of economic justification can be rebutted upon a proper showing.

For this calculation, the Department calculated cost-of-operation based on the DOE test procedures. Therefore,
the consumer is assumed to be an ``average'' consumer as defined by the DOE test procedures. Consumers that use the
products less than the test procedure assumes will experience a longer payback while those that use them more than
the test procedure assumes will have a shorter payback.

f. Economic Justification

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier, Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors to be evaluated in determining whether a conservation standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The engineering analysis identified improvements in efficiency along with the associated costs to manufacturers
for each class of product. For each design option, these costs constitute the increased per-unit cost to manufacturers
to achieve the indicated energy efficiency levels. Manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer markups will result
in a consumer purchase price higher than the manufacturer cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the effects of standards on different-sized firms, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used a computer model that simulated hypothetical firms in the eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries under consideration. This model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model, is explained in the Technical Support Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Technical Support Document, Appendix C. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Manufacturer Impact Model provides a
broad array of outputs, including shipments, price, revenue, net income, and short- and long-run returns on equity.
An ``Output Table'' lists values for all these outputs in the base case and in each of the standards cases under consideration.
It also gives a range for each of these estimates. A ``Sensitivity Chart'' shows how returns on equity would be affected
by a change in any one of the model's nine control variables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For consumers, measures of economic impact are the changes in purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price and annual energy expense. The purchase price and annual energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense, i.e., life-cycle cost, of each standard level are presented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 6 of the Technical Support Document. Under section 325 of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the life-cycle cost analysis is a separate factor to be considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining economic justification.

2. Life-cycle Costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One measure of the effect of proposed standards on consumers is the change in operating expense as compared to the change
in purchase price, both resulting from standards. This is quantified by the difference in the life-cycle costs between
the base and standards cases for the appliance classes analyzed. The life-cycle cost is the sum of the purchase price
and the operating expense, including installation and maintenance expenditures, discounted over the lifetime
of the appliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The life-cycle cost was calculated for the range of efficiencies in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering Analysis for each class in the year standards are imposed, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real consumer discount rates of 2, 6, and 10 percent. The purchase price is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the factory costs in the Engineering Analysis and includes a factory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markup plus a distributor and retailer markup. Energy price forecasts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken from the 1991 Annual Energy Outlook of the Energy Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration. (DOE/Energy Information Administration_0383(91)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance usage inputs are taken from the relevant test procedures.

3. Energy Savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the significant conservation of energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a separate statutory requirement for imposing an energy conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, the Act requires DOE, in determining the economic justification of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, to consider the total projected savings that are expected to result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from revised standards. The Department used the Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory Residential Energy Model results, discussed earlier, in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of total projected savings. The savings for the eight products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are provided in Section IV of this notice.

4. Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This factor cannot be quantified. In establishing classes of products and design options, the Department tried to
eliminate any degradation of utility or performance in the eight products under consideration in this rulemaking.
That is, to the extent that comments, or the Department's own research, indicated that a product included a utility
or performance-related feature that affected energy efficiency, a separate class with a different efficiency standard
was created for that product. In this way, the Department attempted to minimize the impact of this factor as a result
of the standards that were analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Impact of Lessening of Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important to note that this factor has two parts; on the one hand, it assumes that there could be some lessening
of competition as a result of standards; and on the other hand, it directs the Attorney General to gauge the impact,
if any, of that effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assist the Attorney General in making such a determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department studied the affected appliance industries to determine their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing concentrations, levels of competitiveness, and financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performances. This information will be sent to the Attorney General. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document, Chapter 7. The Department has also provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attorney General with copies of this notice and the Technical Support Document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for her review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of the environmental effects from each standard level for each product will be reported under this factor
in the product specific discussion (Section IV) of this notice.

7. Other Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision allows the Secretary of Energy, in determining whether a standard is economically justified, to consider
any other factors that the Secretary deems to be relevant. The Secretary is seeking comments on two issues which may
be considered in this rulemaking. The issues are (1) the incremental impact of appliance conservation standards
on energy use, consumers, manufacturers and other factors (See the discussion regarding rebuttable presumption
under General Analytical Comments) and, (2) the extent to which any proposed national efficiency standard is likely
to disproportionally affect identifiable groups of consumers and whether the analysis should be modified to consider
such impacts in the selection of efficiency standard levels (See the discussion regarding other comments under Product-Specific
Comments for Direct Heating Equipment).

III. Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 90 written comments in response to the September 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990, advance notice. These comments addressed all aspects of the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this section, the Department will present discussions of the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical issues raised by the comments, followed by discussions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product-specific issues.

Discount Rates

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's plans to use a 7 percent discount rate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards' analyses drew more comments than any other issue. (American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Most of the comments asserted that the 7 percent rate was unjustifiably high, while several stated that a 7 percent
or even higher rate was an appropriate rate for the various analyses.

Commentators seeking a higher rate focused on consumer impacts, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those advocating a lower rate generally pointed to societal benefits. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different perspectives are not easily captured in a single discount rate. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has reconsidered the issue, and has decided that multiple discount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, with each pertaining to a different perspective, are warranted. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different rates (i.e., consumer, commercial and societal) are used to capture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impacts of the standards on different constituents. The consumer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial rates are used to calculate life-cycle costs for purchasers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential and commercial products, respectively. The social discount rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used to calculate the net present value of standards for the Nation as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole. Separate rates, therefore, were used for the consumer sector, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial sector (since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased primarily by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial firms), and for society as a whole. This discussion will describe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the derivations of the consumer, commercial and social discount rates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were used in the different analyses.

Consumer discount rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 17, 1989, DOE published a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, and small gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), hereafter referred to as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 1989 final rule. In the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected a 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent discount rate, based on a methodology derived from the Court of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appeals decision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Natural Resources Defense Council 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Herrington, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
768 F.2d 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1355, 1406 (D.C. Cir 1985). As discussed in the November 1989 final rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicability of the court decision changed somewhat with the passage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;514). The Tax Reform Act phased out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deductibility of interest paid on consumer loans. Based on the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology, DOE calculated a range of discount rates that consumers incur; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this range is from less than 1 percent to slightly more than 15 percent. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained in the November 1989 final rule, DOE selected 7 percent for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis for purposes of that rulemaking proceeding because it was near the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-point of the potential consumer discount rates. In addition, DOE believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the approach is reasonable in that it was related to the opportunity cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of money for purchasing consumer durables. As such, it was justified in terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of alternate consumer purchases that are foregone in order to finance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases of appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a subsequent final rule on energy conservation standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers (56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hereafter referred to as the May 1991 final rule, the Department restated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 7 percent rate was near the mid-point of the range of consumer finance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates for the purchase of appliances. It was further stated that if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department could obtain data on the methods that consumers use to purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances, it could develop a weighted-average, real, after-tax finance rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use as a consumer discount rate in the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments on the September 1990 advance notice, Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation offered estimates of consumer financing of purchases of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment: 40 percent of retail sales are paid in cash; 35 percent use credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cards; 25 percent use retailer loans. These figures excluded new home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation's total sales. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1&hyph;2 and Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Whirlpool Corporation represents only one source of data, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has no reason to believe that Whirlpool Corporation's customers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differ from those of other manufacturers, and, therefore, accepted Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation's estimates as representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These numbers were applied to the real, after-tax finance rates that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred by consumers, as reported in the November 1989 final rule. Those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates were estimated to be just over 3 percent for appliances purchased as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of a new home (whose finance rate is a tax-deductible mortgage interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate), to slightly under 1 percent for cash purchases, to more than 15 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for credit card purchases.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When these rates were applied to Whirlpool Corporation's estimates, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting weighted-average, real, after-tax rate incurred by consumers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliance purchases was approximately 6 percent. The Department, then, used 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for the consumer discount rate in the analyses, with sensitivities at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 and 10 percent. The Department believes that this range of discount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivities will capture the real, after-tax rates that consumers encounter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in financing the purchase of an appliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes however, that there remains considerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty in this estimate of the average consumer discount rate. There are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous possible financial interactions that could be involved in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase of an appliance. For example, a credit card purchase could be paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in full within the customary billing grace period, thereby being exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finance charges, and, in effect, resembling a cash purchase. This would tend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to put downward pressure on the weighted-average range of purchase financing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choices. On the other hand, a cash purchase may actually be financed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirectly, by an increase in credit card debt. This would tend to put upward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure on the weighted-average range of purchase finance rates. Furthermore, this analysis does not take into
account varying consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perceptions of the value of reducing current consumption in favor of longer- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term financial gains. For these reasons, the Department continues to solicit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data that might provide a more complete basis for the derivation of a consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount rate used in these analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, while financing rates may indicate the direct financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact to consumers of an investment in increased efficiency, they do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect either other types of investments available to them, or varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer perceptions of the value of reducing current consumption in favor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer-term financial gains. For example, what value of energy savings does a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer need to receive from an investment in an energy efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerator in order to justify reducing savings, increasing debt, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delaying the purchase of other consumer goods? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs of consumer financing does not indicate whether there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar investment opportunities, available to most consumers, that produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher rates of return. For example, are there home improvements or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments that could be made by most consumers that would have higher rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of return than an investment in an energy-efficient appliance? Also, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer discount rate based on consumer financing expenses does not fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for the risks of individual consumer investments in improved appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. For example, the actual rates of return experienced by individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers may vary widely depending on energy prices, appliance usage and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some have argued that implicit discount rates estimated through an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of actual consumer purchases of appliances and related consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment would be a better basis for the consumer discount rate used under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program. Various studies have indicated that these implicit discount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates range from 3 percent to as high as 100 percent (or more) for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances. However, because implicit discount rates are based on actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer purchase behavior, they also reflect the extent to which the numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential market failures in energy efficiency investments occur, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate information, conflicting owner/renter incentives, and second party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(builder/contractor) purchases. One of the major reasons why Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliance efficiency standards were originally established was to overcome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these market failures regarding investment in energy efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, DOE does not believe unadjusted (i.e., not corrected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential biases) discount rates derived from actual consumer behavior should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in evaluating the economic impact of proposed standards on consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This conclusion appears to be supported by court rulings affecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Natural Resources Defense Council 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Herrington, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
768 F.2d 1355, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1406 (DC Cir. 1985), the court stated that ``the entire point of a mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program was to change consumer behavior'' and ``the fact that consumers demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short payback periods was itself a major cause of the market failure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress hoped to correct.'' The Department believes that the intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation which established the appliance standards program is to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy savings which are being foregone because of market failures which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distort consumer decision-making (and behavior) from investing in energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if information were available on the implicit discount rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revealed by consumer decision-making in the absence of any significant market- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure biases, it might provide a better basis for the discount rates to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in assessing the impacts on consumers of proposed appliance efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Another approach might be to examine the rate of return consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require from other fixed investments of comparable risk and liquidity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicits information on the results of any analyses that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the derivation of discount rates using either of these approaches.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the other hand, the nature of the appliance standards program may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imply that a household average required rate of return, whether based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual appliance purchase decisions (in the absence of potential market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure distortions) or on comparable investments, may understate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate rate. Because the Act requires minimum standards, their effect is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally greater on the low-efficiency, low purchase-price end of the market, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes eliminating the lowest-priced models. To the extent that low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households purchase a disproportionate share of these low-efficiency/low-price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances, they will be disproportionately represented among the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, limited empirical research
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 suggests that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households exhibit higher-than-average discount rates (i.e., required rates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return) across all of their time-sensitive decisions, including (but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to) their appliance purchases. If, indeed, these households are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disproportionately affected by standards, their discount rates would need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given greater weight in determining the effects of alternative standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels on consumers. The Department seeks comment on this issue.

Based on the information now available, it appears that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer discount rate lies in the range of 4 to 10 percent. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the Department has used a 6 percent consumer discount rate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses in this rulemaking. The Department has conducted sensitivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses using the 4 to 10 percent range and will continue to solicit data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments that would provide a better basis for the derivation of consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount rates.

Commercial discount rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a discount rate that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable in the fluorescent ballast analysis, the Department believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one based on consumer expenses is inappropriate; the rate should be based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs in the commercial sector, since fluorescent lamp ballasts are purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use primarily in that sector. In developing a rate for use in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial sector, the Department considered a procedure similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure used to develop a consumer discount rate, and examined possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods of financing purchases of more efficient lighting equipment. One such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method would be to finance a loan. For the most credit-worthy customers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prime rate of interest would be applicable. Tables 15 and 21 of the

presented forecasts of prime interest rates and percentage changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer price index (CPI) for each year between 1995 and 2015. During this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the prime rate is expected to be fairly stable, ranging from 8.37 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent to 8.50 percent. The changes in the consumer price index are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected to range from 3.88 percent to 4.90 percent. The resulting real 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates of interest are projected to range from 3.55 percent in 2014 to 4.64 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of 3.85 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most companies, of course, are not eligible for prime-rate loans. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them, the terms of borrowing are generally less favorable. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DRI/McGraw-Hill does not forecast long-term, non-prime loan rates, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insight can be gained from how such loans rates differ from prime loan rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a telephone conversation with the Federal Reserve System, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learned that most commercial loans were in the 6 percent to 15 percent range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the higher rate, 15 percent, and deducting the applicable changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer price index, the Department calculated real rates of interest ranging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 10.1 percent in 2014 to 11.2 percent in 1995, with a 21-year average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10.46 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Department looked at the divergence of the 15 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans from the then current prime rate; such loans were 50 percent greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the 10 percent prime rate prevailing in 1990. By applying a 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase to the projected prime interest rates, the Department obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal rates of interest of 12.56 percent to 12.75 percent. After a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction of the expected changes in the consumer price index, real rates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest ranged from 7.76 percent to 9.87 percent, averaging 8.05 percent over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 21-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another possible financing mechanism would be for the corporation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finance the purchase of the more efficient equipment by displacing investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital. In Table 8 of DRI/McGraw-Hill's forecasts, there are annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projections of the after-tax costs of financial capital for each year between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995 and 2015. After converting the numbers to pre-tax costs, and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deducting the expected changes in the consumer price index, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained the respective real rates of interest. The costs of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital are projected to range from 11.61 percent in 1995 to 12.86 percent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2015. The consumer price index rates forecasts are the same as before, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resulting real finance rates range from 7.67 percent in 2000 to 7.96 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent in 2015, with the 21-year average being 7.86 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the different possible means of companies paying for conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in lighting equipment, the range of real rates of interest is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 3.55 percent to 11.12 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economic theory suggests that in deriving a commercial discount rate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department should consider the opportunity costs of commercial investments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were foregone. Therefore, the Department also investigated real rates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return from commercial investment activities between 1961 and 1990. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data were compiled from Annual Statistical Digests of the Board of Governors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Reserve System. The variables that were examined were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial trade credit, i.e., bankers acceptances; time deposits, i.e. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates of deposits; U.S. Treasury securities; and commercial paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 30-year period, the average real investment returns realized in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial sector ranged from 2.02 percent for bankers' acceptances (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituted 70 percent of the investment dollars), to 2.29 percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments in Treasury securities (which constituted 9 percent of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment dollars). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When more risky investments, such as tax-exempt (class B) and corporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AA) bonds were examined, their real rates were 1.27 percent and 3.52 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, over the 1970-to-1986 period. These real rates, too, were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially outside of the purchase finance range. The real rates for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonds in earlier years also fell below the purchase financing range of rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the above, the Department elected to use four percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the commercial discount rate. The Department believes that this rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximates the real costs likely to be incurred by private businesses which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are able to finance small additional investments in energy efficiency by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing relatively liquid corporate investments, e.g., bankers' acceptances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or by obtaining loans at or near the prime interest rate, without diminishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their normal business investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if increasing investments in more energy efficient technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are assumed to displace other, more profitable business investments, or would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require loans available only at more typical commercial interest rates, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximate discount rate would be higher. For example, between 1980 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991, the real rates of return to nonfinancial corporations averaged between 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 8 percent based on data contained in Table 1.16 of the National Income and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Product Accounts, as presented in the Department of Commerce's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Survey of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Business 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and, as noted above, real commercial interest rates often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded 7 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department invites comment on the most appropriate methodology upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to base the commercial discount rate and the best types and sources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to use in the calculation of this rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Social discount rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In identifying a discount rate that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for use in calculating benefits to the Nation as a whole, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider the opportunity costs of devoting more economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources to the production and purchase of more energy-efficient appliances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fewer national resources to other alternative types of investment. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not necessary, however, to determine the characteristics of specific classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of consumers or businesses directly impacted by the proposed standard. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reasons, a broad measure of the average rates of return earned by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic investment throughout the United States is the most useful basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a social discount rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using this approach, the Office of Management and Budget prepared a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background on OMB's Discount Rate Guidance in November of 1992, containing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of the average annual real rate of return earned on investments made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since 1960 in nonfinancial corporations, non-corporate farm and non-farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietorships, and owner-occupied housing in the United States. The results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this analysis indicated that since 1980, the annual real rate of return for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these categories of investments averaged slightly more than 7 percent, ranging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a low of about 4 percent for owner-occupied housing (which represented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 43 percent of total capital assets in 1991 of about $15 trillion) to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high of about 9 percent on non-corporate farm and non-farm capital (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented about 23 percent of the total). Between 1960 and 1980, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average real rate of return on capital was higher, averaging about 8.5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 1970's and about 11.2 percent in the 1960's. As a result of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, the Office of Management and Budget chose to designate 7 percent as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the social discount rate specified in revisions to Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Circular A&hyph;94 issued on November 10, 1992 (57 FR 53519). In that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised circular, Office of Management and Budget established, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 discount rate guidance for benefit-cost analyses of regulatory programs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide benefits and costs to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative method for deriving such social discount rate might be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad measures of the costs of financing capital investments in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. One such measure is the Federal Government's cost of borrowing or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest rate that is payable on long-term Government securities. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be the prime interest rate available to major corporate borrowers. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to derive a real discount rate from either of these measures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant interest rate would be adjusted for inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to long-term Government securities as an example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal rates during June 1991 on Government securities maturing between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years 2000 and 2015 averaged 8.55 percent. Adjusted by long term forecasts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inflation, the rate would be approximately 4 percent. Because the Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowing rate most accurately reflects the direct cost to the Government of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added investment, the Office of Management and Budget has used this approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the basis for discount rates used in evaluating Federal investments which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly affect Federal costs (such as energy efficiency investments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal facilities). Using the prime interest rate or some combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates to reflect non-Federal financing costs would result in somewhat higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, because the cost of financing additional capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments does not reflect the full opportunity cost of shifting private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment from one area to another, it is not considered to be a good basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deriving discount rates. For this reason, DOE is now proposing the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 7 percent social discount rate in National net present value calculations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although it will also perform sensitivity analyses at 4 percent and 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. The Department seeks comment on appropriate discount rates for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.

Another consumer issue that drew a considerable number of comments was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the suggestion that in its life-cycle cost analyses, the Department include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any additional installation and maintenance expenses that may result from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 10; Energen, No.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In each of the consumer analyses, such as payback and life-cycle costs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department did include all incremental expenses caused by standards. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those design options entailing additional maintenance expenses (beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base case), the incremental maintenance expenses were included in the consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price of the design option. Installation expenses that were specific to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design option and independent of the application were also included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer price of the design option.

Regional and Other Variations in Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments recommended that the Department look at regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variations in usages of some climate-sensitive products, e.g., direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 10; United Texas Transmission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company, No. 26 at 3; Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 1; Arkansas Western Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company, No. 64 at 3; and Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards analysis assumes that nationwide average appliance usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, energy prices, and efficiency applied to all consumers in all areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nation, although the Department recognizes that there exist large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variations in each of these factors. However, the Department did conduct a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity analysis on the life-cycle cost for energy prices by substituting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various high and low regional prices for national prices. The results of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sensitivities are presented in the Technical Support Document. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document, Chapter 4. However, these sensitivity analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were performed at the national level, and no effort is made to link them with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any specific population groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks information concerning the extent to which any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed national efficiency standard is likely to affect identifiable groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of consumers disproportionally and how best to consider such impacts in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of efficiency standard levels. The Department is also seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional data to help it better assess the disproportionate impacts on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups.

On a related issue, numerous comments suggested that the usage variables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department should use are those that are calculated from field usage data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, many of the comments provided estimates of annual operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses of several of the appliances, e.g. water heaters, direct heating

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department appreciates the data it received. The Department also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained data on unit energy consumption by appliance type, principally from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility companies. The Department reviewed the data received from all sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and generated what it believes are the best estimates of energy consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are contained in the proposed test procedure amendments for mobile home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnaces, direct heating equipment, pool heaters and kitchen ranges and ovens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed above, and were used in the analyses for today's notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, regional energy prices were used in sensitivity

for mobile home furnaces and direct heating equipment have been modified from

a national basis to a regional one to reflect the mostly regional distribution

Rebound Effect

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments raised the issue of rebound effects, which occur when an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliance that is made more efficient is used more intensively, so that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected energy savings from the efficiency improvement do not fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materialize. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 2). American Council for an Energy Efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economy commented that the consumer sees and reacts to his or her total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility bill, so any efficiency change in a particular product that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small impact on his or her total utility bill should not affect usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior. Washington Gas Light suggested that usage elasticities should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided by rigorous analyses of regional appliance usage characteristics.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this rulemaking, the rebound effects assumed were: 30 percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct heating equipment and mobile home furnaces, 20 percent for room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners, and 10 percent for ranges and ovens. These percentages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the amounts by which the potential energy savings from standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is, however, an argument that the usage elasticities/rebound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects for at least some household uses of energy may be substantial. Within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a household, the price elasticity of demand will be an average of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticities of demand for each end use, e.g. appliance. For example, suppose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the price elasticity of demand at the household level is .3. If some levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of appliance usage (say refrigerators) are insensitive to price changes, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zero elasticity, then at least one other use must have an elasticity in excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of .3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the usage elasticity for a product is identical to the price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticity of demand for the energy the product uses, then it follows that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weighted average of the usage elasticities of all household uses must equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household price elasticity of demand. Since the appliances subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy efficiency standards account for more than 80 percent of household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption, it would be unlikely that all appliances would have usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticities less that the overall household price elasticity of demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Energy Information Administration, the household price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticity of demand for electricity is about .15 in the short run and upward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of .7 in the long run. Thus usage elasticities, should, on average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximate these estimates. The Department seeks comments on this argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Marginal Electricity Rates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Natural Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defense Council, and Washington Gas Light all urged the Department to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marginal electricity rates rather than average ones. (American Council for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13 at 18; and Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 3). American Council for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Efficient Economy and Natural Resources Defense Council both stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that since room air conditioners are run disproportionately during periods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peak utility load (when rates are the highest), the use of average electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates will undervalue the electricity savings from improved efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that use of average electricity prices can produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccuracies and does attempt to use energy prices specific to each end use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, electricity rates have been assumed higher for air conditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than for other end uses, based on survey data of consumer expenditures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disaggregated according to equipment ownership. The consumer analysis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed rule continues to distinguish energy prices by end use, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such survey results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington Gas Light added that in addition to using marginal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity prices, the Department should use the All-Ratepayers Test when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring the cost effectiveness of a standard level. This test was developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the California Public Utilities Commission, and it measures the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an action on all ratepayers, including non-participants in the conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity. (Washington Gas Light, No. 37 at 13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this program the Department examines the effect of energy conserved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by each purchaser of a more efficient appliance, but does not examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects that the aggregate conservation effects would impose on the rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged within a given utility. The impacts on any system's rates from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased energy standards would depend on the participation rates of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers in the conservation activity and the particular financial position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the utility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments discussed the impact of energy conservation standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on low-income people. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern Union Gas Company, No. 46 at 1; Laclede, No. 55 at 5; Oklahoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 5; and Public Service Company of North 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 5). While the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with improved energy efficiency, the prices of used appliances could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to decline in the short run, the other comments all stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher prices that would be caused by improved efficiency standards on new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units would have price-increasing effects on used appliances and, therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be harmful for lower-income and elderly consumers on fixed incomes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department conducted literature searches on purchasing and usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions in low-income households, to determine whether the inputs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer analysis should be adjusted to account for differences between low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and average-income households. There was no information available on which to

base any changes to the consumer analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another consumer issue was raised by Valmont Electric, which stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new energy conservation standards on fluorescent ballasts would raise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail prices of such ballasts, thereby impeding the conversion from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incandescent lighting to fluorescent lighting. (Valmont Electric, No. 16 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversions from incandescent lighting to fluorescent lighting occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principally through compact fluorescent bulbs, the ballasts of which are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included as part of the review of the legislated fluorescent ballast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards. Any revised energy conservation standards on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluorescent ballasts will not affect the prices of compact fluorescent bulbs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thereby slow the conversion from incandescent to fluorescent lighting.

On the issue of consumer acceptance of heat pump water heaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crispaire Corporation stated that studies show consumer satisfaction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. (Crispaire Corporation, No. 19 at 1). In addition, the company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided attachments with estimates of unit energy consumption and annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance factors for heat pump and resistance water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department appreciates the information provided and used the cited

Appliance Lifetimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments discussed product lifetimes. Wisconsin Blue Flame Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that pilot lights decrease condensate, thereby extending the tank life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gas water heaters. (Wisconsin Blue Flame Council, No. 33 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department based product lifetimes on an analysis comparing recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement sales to historical shipments, and researched the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular design options on product life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Energy Heat Systems said that the lifetime of heat pumps for pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters is approximately the same as for air conditioning, if the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemistry of the pool is maintained in proper balance. (Air Energy Heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systems, No. 44 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department did not analyze heat pump pool heaters because no test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Modeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were several issues raised with regard to the forecasting efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the analyses. For example, Natural Resources Defense Council suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Department model uncertainty, not point forecasts in economic growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and consumer choice and further suggested that the Department could model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainties in economic growth by modeling high-, mid-, and low-growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 35&hyph;36). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that all forecasts contain uncertainties. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal method by which DOE has accounted for uncertainties has been through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity analyses, which, in the past, have been performed on equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices, energy prices, projected equipment efficiencies and market discount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates (the last of which models uncertainties in consumer choices of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department favors an explicit representation of the uncertainty in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the forecasts. Clearly, the best representation would be a statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the uncertainty in each of the important variables, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients used in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model. At this time, however, such a specification of the distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the variables and coefficients does not exist. As the Lawrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model is updated, such distributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be generated, which will allow the Department to work towards the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability to perform an uncertainty analysis in the model. Until then, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department will model uncertainties with sensitivities.

On the other hand, Natural Resources Defense Council endorsed the

Advance Transformer Company recommended that the Department exclude

in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model. Instead, the

With regard to television power and usage forecasts, the Electronics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industries Association stated that television sets of newer vintage draw less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power than those of older vintage. To support this, Electronic Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association presented data for the period 1967&hyph;1991. (Electronic Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, No. 30 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thomson Consumer Electronics, Inc. provided data on the energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of color televisions by size, and asserted that the most important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor in energy usage is viewing habits, specifically, the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrently operating televisions in a household, the number of daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating hours for each receiver, and control settings, i.e., brightness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound levels. (Thomson Consumer Electronics, Inc., No. 49 at 3&hyph;5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department welcomes the additional data provided in the comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the energy consumption of a television set is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of vintage. It was included in a previous analysis

Two comments addressed the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it had no strong concerns with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Model at this time. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1). The Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Office said that the Department should document, well before the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, all model assumptions. In addition, the Florida Energy Office offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide Florida-specific data to the Department. (Florida Energy Office, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will continue to use the basic Lawrence Berkeley

The Department did take cross-elasticity effects into account in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of water heaters (between electric and gas fuels) where they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly important, and will continue to look for instances where such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects may arise in order to take those effects into account as warranted.

Market power. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical of the way the Department models marketplace monopsony power, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the market power of purchasers. In its critique, the Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers stated that the ability of manufacturers to pass on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased costs to the consumer is limited because their customers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily a group of large and sophisticated retailers who have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and increasing power in the marketplace, and who exert downward pressure on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the retail prices of appliances. It further stated that the Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model attempts to model the situation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling a larger number of manufacturers than actually exist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
theoretical underpinnings were given for this assertion and that there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason why the predictions of this ``false model'' should have any resemblance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to what actually transpires in the real world. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 67&hyph;68). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that oligopsony power itself could probably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeled analogously to oligopoly power. There is, however, no accepted theory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the modeling of an industry characterized by both oligopoly and oligopsony. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, DOE detailed the assumptions and relevant mathematical derivations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approach in the aforementioned Technical Support Document for the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule for dishwashers, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. The approach is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the number of firms input into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model until the markups that are actually observed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace are achieved; this is also an obvious implication of The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comments that manufacturers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to pass on costs is limited. In fact, the most prominent comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a review panel on the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model indicated a concern that the modeling assumptions had gone too far in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the direction of reduced markups.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were also three comments critical of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's modeling of an individual firm. It was argued that the use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``typical firm'' does not address the differential impacts of standards on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies, e.g., sizes, costs, niche markets. The Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers insisted that the Department could address the lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data in performing this type of analysis by researching the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature or by developing an economic theory of how different classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers would be affected by standards. Whirlpool Corporation suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing the data problem by putting a range on the cost and margin data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 3; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 68&hyph;69). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The problem is essentially a lack of data. The Department's review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economic literature offered no solution to this problem. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does analyze the cost and margin data (in addition to other parameters) by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing a sensitivity analysis where the Department changes those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters (and others) in the model, and tests the sensitivity of the model's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During interviews conducted with manufacturers, the Department asked a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series of questions covering the effects of firm size and specialization. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, DOE has not been given information by the industry to draw conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about probable effects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While it would be desirable to analyze the impact of standards on the distribution of firms in an industry, fundamentally,
this requires detailed information on how individual firms differ from the norm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stating that the primary concern to manufacturers is the short-run industry impact from standards, Whirlpool Corporation
and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers called for the Department to present greater focus on, or explanation
of, short-run impacts. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1; Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A
at 69&hyph;70). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are limitations to such an analysis. While general impacts may be understood, the specific details of how each
firm reacts at each point of the short-run adjustment process are beyond the ability of economic theory to elucidate.
The Department believes that it has treated the short run properly by modeling it on the short-run impact of the downturn
from a business cycle. In addition, in considering standard levels to propose, the Department did take explicit account
of the short-run Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers suggested that more detailed analysis of the impacts on individual
firms and other areas should be done. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers commented that an analysis
of how industry will fare, on average, belies the very serious effects that adjustment can have, especially if standards
force a company in a small community to close. Therefore, it is important, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers
believes, that DOE evaluate these potential short-term and individual company impacts. (Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers, No 61A at 70). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the analyses to date, the Department has used industry profitability as the best single indicator of plant closures
and other significant disruptions on manufacturers. Further, the primary impact variables of returns on equity,
net income, revenue, price, and shipments have been presented as the best summary statistics with which to capture
the significant impacts resulting from standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In another comment, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that firms face constraints on the share
of their resources that can be devoted to meeting each new wave of conservation standards from DOE. The cumulative
impact of each new rulemaking on manufacturers' resources must be considered in evaluating manufacturer impacts.
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 70&hyph;72). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is designed to analyze the impact of standards on industry
profitability for an individual appliance. To date, this has involved treating each manufacturer of a subject product
as a separate company. Recognizing, however, that many of the manufacturers produce more than one appliance type
subject to these rulemakings, and recognizing that those companies may have limited resources to comply with the
requirements of all of the relevant regulations, the Department is presently seeking approaches to account for the
cumulative effects on a multi-product company of the appliance conservation standards that it promulgates and requests
comments in this regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Variable costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On another manufacturer issue, Whirlpool Corporation criticized the Department's assumption that pricing relates
only to variable costs. Whirlpool Corporation suggested, instead, that changes in fixed costs do have an impact on
pricing in an industry. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department acknowledges that firms may try to pass on fixed costs; however, standard economic theory concludes
that even monopolists will find this unprofitable, and will eventually decide not to try it. The Department has seen
no argument or evidence to the contrary. It is interesting to note that if Whirlpool Corporation were correct, the
manufacturers who decided to do so would be impacted far more favorably by standards than the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer
Impact Model predicted.

Consumer Demand

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whirlpool Corporation stated the Department assumes that consumers will pay more for energy efficiency. Whirlpool
Corporation claims studies have shown this has not been true. In support, Whirlpool Corporation supplied a list of
20 key buying factors from an August 1988 McKinsey study. Energy efficiency placed tenth in consideration for kitchen
products. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31, at Attachment 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that energy efficiency placed ahead of other factors such as ``lowest price available among
similar makes and models,'' ``has an extended service agreement at a fair price,'' and ``runs quietly.'' These results
tend to support the Department's position that consumers are willing to pay for energy efficiency.

Rebuttable Presumption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For consideration of rebuttable presumptions, the Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers stated that incremental payback, not cumulative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payback, are the appropriate payback for standards. (Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 64). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the legislation requires that payback be considered from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level compared to the base case, DOE believes that only cumulative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payback may be used for the rebuttable presumption determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the other impacts of appliance conservation standards on energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, consumers, manufacturers, and other factors were determined by comparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projections under the base case
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 with the projections under the proposed standards.

Standards Decision Making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Natural Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed the Department's standards selection criteria. Both Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deciding the economic justification of standards, the Department should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempting to maximize the economic benefits to consumers, but should instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be maximizing energy savings. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department recognizes that the basic statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction to set standards is to achieve the ``maximum improvement in energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency that the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically justified'' (section 325(l)(2)(A). DOE notes that the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of standards on consumers is only one of the factors the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers in reaching its decision to set conservation standards. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors include impacts on manufacturers and on national benefits and costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, regarding consumer benefits, while the minimum consumer life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost point is selected as a trial standard level, and in many cases, the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent standard level that the Secretary determined was economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified coincided with that level, several of the proposed standard levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have life-cycle costs that exceed the minimum life-cycle cost. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximizing consumer benefits does not take precedence over maximizing energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Resources Defense Council further stated that in deciding on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels, the Department must first consider the most stringent level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of efficiency, i.e., the ``max tech'' level, and if it is economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified, DOE must set the standard at that level. If it is not economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified, DOE must then consider the next most stringent level, and if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically justified, set the standard at that level. (Natural Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defense Council, No. 13 at 17). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does consider candidate standard levels in this manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in making its determination as to whether a standard is economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified, the Department considers both: The benefits and costs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level under consideration relative to the base case; and how these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits and costs compare to the benefits and costs of other standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed by the Department in the technical support document for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently the costs and benefits of all candidate standard levels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed in comparison to the base case. However, it is possible that more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct comparisons of the impacts of different standard levels may be useful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above, the Department specifically solicits comment on whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any incremental perspectives would be useful and valid in the determination as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to whether a particular standard level is ``economically justified.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Energy Office stated that after considering all relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs and benefits over the life of the appliance, the Department should set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards at the highest levels that are cost-effective to the nation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, consideration of the national costs and benefits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of candidate standard levels was one of the factors considered in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. (See Technical Support Document, Chapter 8.)

External Costs and Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking urged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department to consider the external costs and benefits in its economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses of the efficiency standards proposed in this Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking. For example, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that DOE account explicitly for environmental costs in its economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6.) In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, Public Citizen stated that the Department should include in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses all external costs and benefits, e.g., environmental quality, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national security, and reduced energy imports. (Public Citizen, No. 7 at 4.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ``Life-Cycle Cost Analysis'' is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis; (a) environmental external costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, (b) national security and balance-of-payments costs of increased/decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil consumption. (Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council said that the consumer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility analyses should include monetization of externalities (environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and security) such as sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trends in state utility regulations. (Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 60 at 2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that appliance standards may generate external 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
societal benefits arising from reductions in oil imports, and emissions of

 and perhaps other pollutants. In this proposed rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as in previous rulemakings, the Department derives the quantities of oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings and emissions reductions associated with the estimated energy demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions expected to result from the proposed standards, but does not attach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any externality values to these benefits. In a separate Advance Notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rulemaking for three products (58 FR 47326, September 8, 1993), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has indicated that it would be desirable to establish monetary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values for these external benefits, if sound analytical bases can be found for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doing so. The Department will attempt to develop and use such monetary values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the analysis of the likely impacts of updated standards for these three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product categories. However, because there is no consensus on how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertake the analysis underlying estimates of such environmental and energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security externalities, the Department is not yet able to set monetary values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such externalities accurately enough to be useful in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking.

On another standards determination issue, the

of regional standards for room air conditioners. (Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 22.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not setting regional standards, but did conduct a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity analysis on life-cycle cost for room air conditioners because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their energy use is affected by climate. The sensitivity analysis considered

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corporate average fuel economy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rocky Mountain Institute stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for appliances, like the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporate Average Fuel Economy for automobiles, could allow for the gradual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-in of technologies that are substantially different from the present, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less-efficient technologies, e.g., horizontal-axis clothes washers and heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pump water heaters. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department acknowledges that some stringent standard levels could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve radical industry manufacturing changes and recognizes that a Corporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Average Fuel Economy-type approach to such standards could help to ease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry's transition to producing these more efficient appliances. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes, however, that the Act precludes that option since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute requires any covered product to meet the energy conservation standard.

Fuel switching. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the comments in this area dealt with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards selection criteria for specific products. For example, Peoples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Gas Company stated a concern that standards could unintentionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase energy consumption by forcing a switch from gas water heaters to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric. Peoples Natural Gas Company recommended limiting standards-induced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price increases to consumers for gas water heaters to 120 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards-induced price increases for electric resistance water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Peoples Natural Gas Company contended that this would avoid switching from gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to electric by price-sensitive consumers, such as home builders and low-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homeowners. (Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department analyzed standard levels by the methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the September 1990 advance notice, wherein fuel switching was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for as part of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model's forecasting of economic impacts. While some fuel switching did occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(electric water heaters are projected to increase their share of the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 45.5 percent to 50.3 percent, as shown by Table 3.4 of Volume F of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document), the Department does not believe it occurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the relative equipment price increases since the price of electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters are projected to increase much faster than that of gas, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in Section IV below. The Department ascribes the fuel switching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is projected to occur to the relative increase in the price of gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to electricity as shown in Table 5.5 of Volume A of the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support Document.

Impacts on Manufacturers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers contracted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arthur D. Little, Inc. to prepare a report on the Department's analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
top-loading, horizontal-axis clothes washers. In that report, entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Financial Impact of DOE Top-Loading Horizontal Axis Standards on U.S. Washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Machine Manufacturers,'' Arthur D. Little listed a number of criticisms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model and suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department use a ``Cash Flow Model,'' instead. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, Nos. 61D and 61E). Although clothes washers have been dropped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from this rulemaking, as discussed below, many of Arthur D. Little's comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have general applicability to the other appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of Arthur D. Little's criticisms of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model involved that model's consumer preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions. Arthur D. Little stated, ``The combination of price and energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings account for under two-thirds of the basis of selection. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model at best is taking into account a little less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the consumer's decision to purchase.'' Arthur D. Little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded, ``neglected features seriously distort the prediction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer's *&blank;*&blank;* well being.'' (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61E at 25.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to set standards that do not reduce consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility, a gauge of well being, by establishing product classes that protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility. While utility is sometimes a matter of degree, instead of an open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shut case, the basic concept is the establishment of classes that protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a less efficient, but desirable, feature such as the through-the-door ice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service for refrigerators. Since the establishment of classes is performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the manufacturer impact analysis, it is appropriate for the Lawrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model to assume there is no difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in consumer utility between an appliance meeting the different trial standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. Furthermore, since standards are intended to affect only an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliance's energy efficiency (which usually is positively related to price), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling consumer response only to changes in those variables is reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Arthur D. Little report was also critical of the Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model's treatment of market power issues. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report stated that the manufacturer analysis concludes that manufacturers can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set their own prices because the manufacture of the product is concentrated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hands of a small number of producers. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61E at 27.) Furthermore, the report asserted that within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model, mark-up is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countered only by a very weak consumer reaction, as measured by the elasticity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of demand relative to the purchase price of the appliance and its operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major difference that exists in the manufacturer impact analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed for today's notice and typical manufacturer experience to increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices is that the analysis assumes that all manufacturers in the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have to increase prices to meet the standard. This is a very different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario from an individual firm raising its prices independently from its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitors. To accomplish the analysis, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model uses two elasticities; an individual firm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticity, which is used to establish price, and an industry elasticity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is used to establish sales. The individual firm elasticity used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is greater than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry elasticity, and is such that if a firm raises prices it loses sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is this price elasticity faced by the individual firm that determines how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much the firm can mark up price. However, the initial effect of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticity is tempered in the model by the fact that the firm's competitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also raising prices until equilibrium is reached between increased costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the standard and increased prices. The consumer reaction to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher price is then calculated by the industry elasticity, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers' responsiveness to having the appliance or not, as opposed to buying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it from a competing seller for less. Since the Department considers the whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry to be affected by standards, a resulting rise in the general level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices for an appliance would likely have a relatively weak aggregate consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department notes that in Arthur D. Little's own ``cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow'' model, long-run sales of appliances are seemingly unaffected by price; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arthur D. Little has assumed there is no consumer reaction to price, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other words, a price elasticity of zero.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This result may be found by examining Appendix C of the ADL report which contains the results of its cash flow model.
In it, two cases are discussed: a constant volume case and a variable volume case. The distinction between the two is
that in the former, production volume is assumed to be constant for each year, while in the latter, volume is constant
for each year until 1997 (two years before standards when, presumably, sales rise in anticipation of higher prices)
through 2003. The volume then goes back to the same constant level in 2004. Thus, the results indicate that consumers
respond to the coming price increase, but after six years, their demand falls back to the original level, despite the
higher price. Thus, aside from a short run effect over a six-year period, the price elasticity of demand is zero.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This assumption would imply that manufacturers were completely free to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set price at any level they wanted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another area in which the Arthur D. Little report was critical of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model was in the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamic adjustment issues. As Arthur D. Little's report stated, ``To determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact on manufacturers, the Manufacturer Impact Model only examines two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
static cases *&blank;*&blank;* and misses important changes in the health of the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[during the adjustment period].'' (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``two static cases'' to which Arthur D. Little is referring are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base and standards cases. However, Arthur D. Little is incorrect in stating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these two cases are static. As is documented in the Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computes a short-run analysis, the sole purpose of which is to assess the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamic impact of standards, in addition to computing the long-run analysis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the impacts after those dynamic impacts have been absorbed. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamic effect that is captured with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model short-run analysis
is the extra price competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may occur when the quantity demanded is suddenly reduced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards-induced price increase. This dynamic effect generally results in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower profitability over the short-run, as compared to over the long-run, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially at the higher standard levels as reported in Section IV below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This effect is completely ignored by the Arthur D. Little model with its zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price elasticity. However, Arthur D. Little does address a different dynamic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect which the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignore. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dynamic effect addressed by Arthur D. Little is the forward time- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shifting of appliance purchases in anticipation of a standards-induced price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase. The Department has been aware of this for some time, but has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated it into the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model because of a lack of data on the extent of purchase time-shifting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department believes that any effect of time-shifting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is initially positive and then negative. When appliances are bought in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance of standards, the initial effect probably would be to improve profits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cash flow. When the quantity demanded falls temporarily after standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect probably would be to hurt profits and cash flow. These two effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very nearly should cancel over time. The Department notes that this result is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in sharp contrast to the dynamic effect that the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model does consider, which has a non-recoverable impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry. Nonetheless, DOE agrees that time-shifting could bear further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation and will evaluate whether the estimates supplied by Arthur D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little on the magnitude of time-shifting can be of use.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Arthur D. Little also was critical of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model's inability to take into account (or try to predict) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of the consequences of the low profitability that the model sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicts. In particular, its report points out that if the rate of profit did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline significantly in real terms, the industry would have a very hard time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raising additional equity. Arthur D. Little points out that, in actuality, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both owners and financial backers of firms would limit capital until expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return matched their required return. According to the comment, the Lawrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model, therefore, ``*&blank;*&blank;* sacrifices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realism in modeling the relationship between expected return and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
willingness of owners and financial backers to commit capital for retooling.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61E at 27&hyph;28.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with Arthur D. Little's statement regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulty that industry likely would have in raising capital as a consequence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of significantly reduced profitability. Furthermore, it is true that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating the impact of potential standards on an industry, whether positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or negative, as characterized by profitability. The model does not attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predict the specific forms of the damage and the complex reactions (inability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to raise capital, failures of some firms, foreign buy-outs, mergers, capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions, etc.) that could occur within a negatively affected industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department does not believe that it is necessary to attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predict that sort of detail. Rather, DOE believes it is obligated not to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that would cause serious damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the magnitude of the hypothetical profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss is a very good indicator of the magnitude of the impacts that will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed on the industry. When the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impact Model predicts a precipitous decline in profit, this should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted as damaging to the industry. Indeed, in many cases, as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section IV below, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model does predict a sharp drop in profitability, and this prediction figures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strongly in rejecting the standard in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of all the ``deficiencies'' in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model, Arthur D. Little's report suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department abandon the model, and proposed, instead, that the Department use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash-flow model. The cash-flow model determines the economic impact of energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards on manufacturers by estimating the cash flows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with meeting the standards, and calculating a value for those cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flows. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61E at 19 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix C.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Arthur D. Little's cash-flow model submitted does not predict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a manufacturing industry will or will not be hurt by standards. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows one to make various assumptions about the market's behavior, and then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to predict the impact of those assumptions on cash flow; but, it tells nothing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the market's behavior. As a result, the Department notes that Arthur D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little has run three scenarios with radically different implications for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, with no way to choose among them. The model is equally capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing the optimistic and the pessimistic scenario, but it does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an expected scenario. The Department, therefore, does not believe that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash flow model, as presented in Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, could serve to replace the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impact Model for use in the analyses of the impacts of appliance standards on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Arthur D. Little report also stated that one of the key 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proportion of costs that are fixed. The Arthur D. Little report went on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to state that, ``After interviewing all five domestic manufacturers, Arthur D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little was unable to verify that the washing machine manufacturers have any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sense as to the proportion of their costs which are long-term fixed costs *&blank;*&blank;*. Basing a model upon an
assumption that is not empirically verifiable is a risky proposition.'' (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that one of the key assumptions in the Lawrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is the proportion of costs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fixed and variable. The Department is sensitive to the claim that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key input parameter to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model is ``completely alien to manufacturers.'' The Department would certainly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider alternate manufacturer impact models that utilize more known and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verifiable inputs. However, to be an acceptable alternative model, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that such model would have to have forecasting ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar in scope and sophistication as the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model. As discussed above, the cash-flow model submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers does not meet this test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department would be interested in any analyses that indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse manufacturer impacts at any of the proposed standard levels, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to arguments over the severity of the adverse impact of rejected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels.

Impacts on Utilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments addressed the Department's proposed analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of energy conservation standards on electric utilities. Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council stated that the utility analysis needs to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that under the base cases, there will be less forecasting certainty than would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur under new and revised standards, and a greater probability that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilities would misforecast electricity demand. (Natural Resources Defense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council, No. 13 at 32). The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the utility analysis should consider the value of reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty in utility forecasts as a result of standards. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council gave references to a methodology. (Ohio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased demand certainty after standards is an effect that was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captured in the utility analysis. It results in substantial benefits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric utilities, particularly when demand growth is rapid. These benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrue because demand growth is uncertain, and if the utility misforecasts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand, it may build too few or too many power plants. This risk of capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misallocation can be substantial in certain cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the appropriate measure of dollars to use in the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis, Natural Resources Defense Council stated that ``DOE needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do the utility impact analysis in nominal dollar terms, using actual utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions for depreciation and rate of return. Utility rates and finances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are computed in nominal dollars, not real dollars, and this can have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dramatic impact on how new power plant construction will affect rates.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true that utilities calculate rates in nominal dollar terms. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department, therefore, calculated utility impacts in both real and nominal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollars, in order to determine how adding an inflation factor would affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1990), Natural Resources Defense Council stated that utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion plans will need to be consistent with the Act, which will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more controls as the demand for electricity grows. Appliance standards will, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all other things being held equal, make compliance with the Clean Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments less expensive for utilities, as it allows them to meet the cap on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions more easily. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 32, 35). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The utility analysis and the environmental analysis are consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Department collected forecasts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of marketable permits for sulfur, estimates of the other effects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Air Act Amendments, and assessments of future utility generation by fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type. The Department assessed these estimates and assimilated them into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. (See Technical Support Document, Environmental Assessment, Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Energy Office stated that capacity cost credit (for avoided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity) should not be limited to combustion turbines but should match the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
load characteristics of the subject appliance, categorized into peaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate, and baseload groups. Air conditioners should be categorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to their load duration characteristics. (Florida Energy Office, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42, at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that load shape characteristics should be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an assessment of air conditioner (and other appliances) avoided peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand. The current utility analysis accounted for these effects. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department investigated separating energy savings into peaking, intermediate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and baseload categories, to determine if this would have a significant effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the results. The utility analysis assumed a combustion turbine proxy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which values all peak demand savings at the cost of a combustion turbine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the most widely used approach by U.S. utilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council stated that the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis should consider transmission and distribution capacity savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that transmission and distribution capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings should be included in the utility analysis, and did include them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avoided transmission and distribution costs were based on the value assigned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this avoided transmission and distribution capacity by many different U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commentators stated that off-peak water heaters (those that heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water only during off-peak hours) save energy, and that this should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the utility analysis. (National Regional Electric Cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, No. 17 at 1; Vaughn Manufacturing Company, No. 75 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department notes that where utilities offer time-of-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, the economics of off-peak water heating change dramatically and may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very attractive. However, the Department does not have the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require utilities to offer such rates, and believes the lack of these rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered nation-wide precludes consideration of off-peak water heaters in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments discussed the impacts of appliance conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards on natural gas utilities. The Washington Gas Light, Inc. urged the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department to dedicate a similar level of analytical effort to the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost consequences of standards on natural gas appliances as it devotes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts on electric utilities from standards on electric appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department initially studied the potential impacts of standards on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric utilities and not natural gas utilities because there were more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundant data on the former. Furthermore, significantly more residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy consumption is electricity rather than natural gas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, the Department recognizes that for analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completeness, it should conduct studies on the potential impacts of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on natural gas utilities. Accordingly, DOE is now examining methodologies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data sources that will enable it to conduct such studies. The Department, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, welcomes submittals of relevant information and data in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia Gas and the Montana-Dakota Utilities Company stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards on gas appliances would result in a loss of natural gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales, which, in turn, would lead to higher rates to all gas customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 5; Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, No. 54 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not accept the inevitability of that contention; a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of gas sales may or may not increase rates. The actual effect depends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost structure of the gas utility. If avoided costs are larger than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, then reducing sales would actually decrease rates. Without study of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual gas utility cost structures, no 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a priori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 conclusion in this regard can be drawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, four comments addressed the Department's planned analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental effects. Both the Southern Union Gas Company and Columbia Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out that the negative environmental effects from electric resistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters are more severe than are the effects from natural gas water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters. Columbia Gas stated that carbon dioxide emissions from electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance water heaters are 3.8 times higher than those from a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency gas water heater. (Southern Union Gas Company, No. 22 at 2; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 5). Also, the American Gas Association and Columbia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gas urged the Department to consider the environmental impact of the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy delivery cycle, i.e., source energy, not just site consumption only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3; Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statements regarding the relative environmental impacts of gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance electric water heating are generally correct. Furthermore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department does account for source energy (not just site energy) savings by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the fuel used by electric utilities and the consequent emissions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the utility impact assessment and environmental analysis. These effects are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported in Chapter 9 of the Technical Support Document accompanying this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September 1990 advance notice, DOE proposed 12 classes of room air conditioners. The product classes consist
of four categories; units with side louvers, units without side louvers, units with reversing valve with side louvers,
and units with reversing valve without side louvers. There are five class divisions by capacity within each of the
two categories without reversing valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Energy Commission proposed a reduction in product classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 12 to 4, eliminating the class divisions based on capacity. (California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2). Whirlpool Corporation and Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers proposed two additional classes, a casement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slider and a casement only room air conditioner. They stated that restricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geometry adversely impacts the potential new designs that can be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those types of room air conditioners. For example, rotary compressors could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be fitted into the casement units. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 7; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 4). The American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy in its comments cited room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners as an example where broad product classes have been properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6, at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several constraints placed on the design of room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners. Because most room air conditioners are installed in double-hung 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
windows, the size of the most typical double-hung windows becomes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant factor in cabinet design and production. Every room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioner unit could be designed to optimize performance and efficiency as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as a specific cabinet could be built to best suit the unit's particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity and efficiency. Manufacturers cannot afford the luxury of optimizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every model they produce, so they limit their production of cabinets to three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or four sizes. Because of space and configuration limitations, the larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity units for a given cabinet size will tend to be less efficient. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this reason the Department is rejecting the California Energy Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to ignore capacity in establishing classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department decided to adopt additional classes for casement slider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and casement only room air conditioners. These units offer a unique utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the consumer in that they offer a performance-related feature (fitting into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
casement windows) which other room air conditioners cannot provide. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that the size limitations imposed on casement units are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more significant than those faced by typical double-hung window units. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its performance-related feature justified a lower standard, separate product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes were established for casement slider and casement only units. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the small amount of empirical data on casement type units, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was unable to analyze these classes. As a result, the Department is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing any standards for them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design options
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whirlpool Corporation provided detailed comments on each design option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 5&hyph;22 and Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, No. 31 at 6&hyph;13). A number of the comments concerned design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to improve heat exchanger (evaporator and condenser) performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These improvements can be put into two categories; designs for increasing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat transfer surface area and designs for increasing the heat transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients. The heat transfer surface area can be increased by any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following methods: increasing the depth of the coil by adding vertical tube 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rows, increasing the frontal area of the coil by increasing the height or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
width, increasing the fin density, or adding a subcooler to the condenser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coil. The heat transfer coefficients can be increased by using an enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fin design or grooved (rifled) refrigerant tubing. In addition, spraying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensate on the condenser can improve its heat transfer coefficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation commented that cabinet size could prevent or at least limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of tube rows that could be added to increase the depth of the coil. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, they state that the effect of each successive tube row on system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance diminishes rapidly. The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers also commented that compressor reliability could be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of tube rows increases the internal volume of the system and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, the amount of refrigerant required. Compressor reliability could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reduced as the compressor would be required to pump excess refrigerant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whirlpool Corporation added that a thicker coil will increase air flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restriction and may actually reduce efficiency. (Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 9&hyph;10; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the analysis of additional tube rows, the Department used engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design data provided by room air conditioner manufacturers. The data were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on measurements taken from actual room air conditioner units and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included information that specified the number of tube rows that could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to the existing coils. The computer simulation model which was used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis of room air conditioners considered the effect that additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tube rows have on the entire room air conditioner refrigerant system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation commented that increasing the frontal area of the coil would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an increase in chassis size. Coils in existing room air conditioners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are already so large that any useful increase would require an increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size of the cabinet. The incremental cost for such a change would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant. Whirlpool Corporation added that an increase in frontal area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the water removal capability of the evaporator coil. (Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 10; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers's and Whirlpool Corporation's comments regarding the increase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coil's frontal area. Any useful increase in performance would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the cabinet size be increased as well. Manufacturers' cost data for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design were taken into consideration in the analysis. The computer simulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model takes into account the impact of increasing the coil frontal area on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporator's water removal capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation stated that there is a limit to how high the fin density can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased before air flow becomes too restricted and adversely affects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of the unit. In addition, an increased fin density might prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proper drainage of condensate from the evaporator. The Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers added that dirt build-up is a serious concern in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coil design. With a higher fin density, greater dirt build-up is likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in coil degradation and lower unit efficiency. (Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 11; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicited comments from room air conditioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers regarding the maximum allowable fin densities for a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporator and condenser coils. Their comments served as a guideline to how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high fin densities could be increased for prospective coils. The computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulation model is capable of calculating the effect that increased fin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
density has on the air-side pressure drop across the coil and, in turn, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power consumption of the fan motor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its comment concerning subcoolers, Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers asserted that subcoolers are not used unless it is impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve the needed subcooling without them. The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers also stated that when a subcooler is needed, the available room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the chassis dictates the allowable length of the subcooler. (Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 12, 13). Whirlpool Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that a subcooler type that transfers heat from the refrigerant in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid line to the superheat exiting the evaporator is not practical in room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air conditioners due to limited space within the cabinet. (Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, No. 31 at 10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department understands the conventional practice used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers for incorporating subcoolers into room air conditioners. But 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department does not believe that this should prevent the design option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from being considered. As long as the chassis of the particular unit is large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to accommodate it, a subcooler will be considered as a way to improve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit's performance. Engineering data supplied by manufacturers provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the maximum length of subcoolers which could be incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a particular unit. The data were used to establish subcooler length for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective room air conditioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced fin surfaces, such as wavy or slit patterns, improve the heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer capability of a coil by increasing the air-side heat transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficient. In its comments regarding enhanced fin designs, the Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that most manufacturers now use a wavy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or ``waffle'' fin (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional improvement can be achieved through the use of ``lanced'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``louvered'' fins. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers expressed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern that data based on work performed by manufacturers should be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavily relied upon than data based on published research papers available in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public domain. The publicly available data seems to be either based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
theoretical analysis or research-type testing of simulated coil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
configurations. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the correlation between the data and actual performance results in room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners is difficult to determine. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 13, 14). Whirlpool Corporation stated that air flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reduced and air-side pressure drop across the coil is increased due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating enhanced fin surfaces into coils. But Whirlpool Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added that enhanced fin designs provide significant improvement without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial additional cost. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department generally agrees with the comments made by Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers concerning enhanced fin design. Test data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from room air conditioner manufacturers and heat exchanger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers are given more weight than theoretical analyses when deciding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how much of an improvement should be given to the air-side heat transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients due to enhanced fin surfaces. The Department does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the theoretical or research data available in the public domain should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dismissed entirely, and is using it as a check on the data received from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers to determine if their information is reasonable. Improvements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the air-side heat transfer coefficients are input to the computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulation model. With this information on improvements, the model is able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine what effect enhanced fin surfaces have on the entire room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioner system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Augmenting the smooth inside surface of refrigerant tubing with grooves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the tube's refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficient. Grooved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(rifled) tubing can therefore improve the heat transfer capability of a coil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' comments concerning grooved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tubing are similar to the comments it gave regarding enhanced fin surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that data based on work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed by manufacturers should be more heavily relied upon than data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by refrigerant tubing manufacturers. The Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers asserted that the data made available by tubing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers are generally obtained under optimized conditions rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions representing actual application in room air conditioners.

Corporation states that grooved tubing costs significantly more than smooth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tubing but has a beneficial effect on system performance. (Whirlpool

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with enhanced fin surface data, the Department is giving more weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to data received from room air conditioner manufacturers when deciding how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much improvement should be given to the refrigerant-side heat coefficients due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to grooved tubing. The Department is using data made available by refrigerant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tubing manufacturers as well as data provided by research papers in the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domain to compliment the data received from room air conditioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. (See Technical Support Document, Volume H). Improvements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients are input as multipliers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the computer simulation model. With the multipliers, the model is able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine what effect grooved tubing has on the entire room air conditioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system.

Whirlpool Corporation stated that it is standard practice to spray condensate produced by the evaporator onto the
condenser coil. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because most, if not all, manufacturers incorporate the spraying of condensate into their room air conditioners,
the Department did not analyze condensate spray as a design option. Baseline models for each of the product classes
are assumed to include condensate spray in their designs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improving the air system efficiency can be accomplished either by increasing the fan or fan motor efficiency. In a
room air conditioner, both the evaporator and condenser fans are driven by one fan motor. The Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers stated that increases in air system efficiency are limited because of the following: Configuration
constraints due to the compact design of room air units; standardization of air system components because the industry's
supply comes almost entirely from a single vendor; lower fan motor efficiencies that occur because the room air unit
design is optimized at fan speeds other than the point of maximum motor efficiency; and air system designs which must
limit noise levels. In addition, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that fan motor efficiency
is not expected to increase significantly by the year 1995. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also
stated that reductions in restrictions to air flow can be made only by increasing the space available for air flow.
Major increases in cost would be associated with such a change as it would necessitate an increase in the chassis of
the room air conditioner. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 16&hyph;19). Whirlpool Corporation
repeated much of what the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated and, in addition, stated that the use
of separate fan motors would require significant redesign and increase the product cost. (Whirlpool Corporation,
No. 31 at 11). Natural Resources Defense Council said that DOE should add improved air flow past coils as a design option.
(Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommended
that DOE treat fan and fan motor efficiency separately. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at
3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its analysis of increasing the air system efficiency, the Department analyzed only improvements that could be
made to the fan motor. The data from fan manufacturers did not provide information on the effect of different fan types
on air system efficiency in a room air conditioner application. Therefore, the Department did not analyze improvements
due to changes in the fan efficiency. The Department agrees with the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's
comment regarding restrictions to air flow. Increasing the space available for air flow can be accomplished only
by enlarging the chassis size. In the analysis of increased coil face areas where the cabinet size had to be increased,
increases in system efficiency were assumed to be a result not only of the enlarged coil, but also the improvement in
air flow resulting from the larger cabinet. Therefore, improvements in the air flow past the coils are inherently
considered in the analysis of increased coil face areas. The Department utilized data obtained from fan motor manufacturers
to determine efficiency increases and the associated incremental costs for improving the efficiency of fan motors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation commented that most room air conditioner
manufacturers use rotary compressors. Improvements beyond the currently available efficiency of 11.0 energy efficiency
ratio are expected to be small. They also stated that higher efficiency scroll compressors might be suitable for larger
capacity room air units. But use of scroll compressors would significantly increase the cost of room air conditioners.
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 19, 20; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 11). Natural Resources
Defense Council said that DOE should disaggregate the design option of improving the compressor efficiency into
motor efficiency, volumetric efficiency, reduced mechanical resistance in pumps, and alternate compressor designs.
(Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department took into account data from both room air conditioner and compressor manufacturers when determining
the available efficiency increase in compressors. The data indicated that most room air conditioners use rotary
compressors and that the maximum energy efficiency ratio for compressors of this type is 11.0. Other compressor types
were also analyzed. New technologies for reciprocating compressors with capacities exceeding 17,000 Btu/h have
pushed energy efficiency ratios past 11.0. These reciprocating compressors were considered for the two largest
capacity classes of room air conditioners. Scroll compressors were also considered, but for the compressor capacities
in the range used in room air conditioner units, energy efficiency ratios did not exceed 11.0. Compressor manufacturers
indicated that there is a high probability that compressor energy efficiency ratios ranging from 11.5 to 12.0 would
be available by the year 1995. Based on this information, compressor efficiencies of this magnitude were analyzed
by the Department. In response to Natural Resources Defense Council's comment, compressor manufacturers increase
compressor efficiency by improving the performance of these individual components. Data for the impact of component
improvements are not available but, component improvements are reflected in higher compressor energy efficiency
ratios. Therefore, the Department is analyzing the compressor as a whole rather than attempting to analyze individual
components.

 The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that DOE revise the room air conditioner test procedure
to determine the energy savings on a cycling rather than a steady state basis. If the test procedure cannot be revised
during the rulemaking, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy recommended development of methods
to estimate the benefits of design options which tend to improve efficiency under cycling conditions. (American
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2). On the other hand, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers
and Whirlpool Corporation stated room air conditioners are not normally turned on for extended periods of time, and
when they are turned on the (room and ambient) temperature is more likely to be high, reducing the amount of cycling.
The current one-temperature test procedure adequately matches consumer usage patterns for room air conditioners.
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that any change in the procedure will drive up the product cost
and provide no benefit. It was the contention of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation
that design options such as variable speed compressors, electronic expansion valves, thermostatic cycling controls,
and possibly use of alternative refrigerants that improve efficiency under cycling conditions will not result in
any measurable efficiency improvements. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that the addition
of a cycling test must be justified by in-depth studies and field experiments to determine if the efficiency improvements
such a revision would predict are cost-effective. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 6&hyph;8;
Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 12&hyph;14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department believes that some design options may improve efficiency under cycling conditions.
The Department also agrees that before such design options are translated into test procedure credits, field tests
would need to be conducted to provide evidence to support such credits. Therefore, for purposes of this rulemaking,
cycling designs for room air conditioners will not be given test procedure credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though no test procedure credit will be given to cycling designs, the Department believes that energy savings can
be realized through the use of variable speed compressors. Energy savings for variable speed compressors have been
estimated by extrapolating from results based on tests performed on central air conditioners. The extrapolated
estimate is significantly lower than what test results indicate for central systems. A low estimate is used because
room air conditioners probably cycle less than central systems. Cycling data for room air conditioners are not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are some design options listed in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which are theoretically possible,
but for which experimental data or prototypes are not available. The impact of electronic expansion valves and thermostatic
cycling controls on the efficiency of room air conditioners has not been analyzed because the Department was not able
to obtain any data for these designs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation made comments regarding replacement
refrigerants for R&hyph;22. They commented that though research has identified refrigerant blends (non-azeotropic
mixtures) that could improve the efficiency of room air conditioners, no prototypes have been developed that demonstrate
this potential. In addition, changes would be required in room air conditioner systems, e.g., heat exchangers, in
order for the unit to operate efficiently with the replacement refrigerant. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,
No. 61A at 8; Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 15).

The Department agrees with the comments made by the Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation regarding replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerants for R&hyph;22. Since no prototypes exist, the Department did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze replacement refrigerants as a design option for room air conditioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provided extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments regarding the computer simulation model used by the Department to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze room air conditioners. The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers proposed the following changes to the computer simulation model: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Modification of the compressor subroutine to model rotary compressors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to simulate reciprocating compressors better; (2) correction of the condensate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray subroutine to predict its effect on system performance better; (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of correction factors to account for indoor/outdoor air leakage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-circuiting of indoor air, and heat leakage through the divider wall; (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of multiplication factors to modify coil heat transfer coefficients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of using enhanced fin surfaces; (5) addition of correction factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to modify such values as the compressor power and refrigerant mass flow rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to assist in calibrating the model to test data; and (6) addition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a psychometric heat balance routine to check that the results from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulation model are thermodynamically consistent. In addition to making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the simulation model, the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers requested that DOE calibrate the model to match industry test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for the baseline models chosen to represent each of the room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioner product classes. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also requested that the room air conditioner industry be given the opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conduct experiments to judge the model
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s validity after the needed changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the model were completed. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also stated that manufacturers' data should be given significant weight in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicting the increases to efficiency due to design modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 2,3). Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation stated that it fully supports the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers's recommended changes to the computer simulation model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has made the changes to the simulation model that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Simulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline models were calibrated against test data submitted by manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department encourages the room air industry to test the validity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simulation model and submit results in response to the standard levels being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that latent cooling be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in room air conditioner energy savings, and that DOE investigate whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spread between evaporator temperatures has been reduced to a minimum. (Rocky 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The computer simulation model used in the analysis of room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners evaluated the thermodynamic performance of the refrigerant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. In this evaluation, the removal of latent heat was calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimization of the difference in evaporator inlet and outlet temperatures is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an inherent consideration in heat exchanger and system design. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature difference was determined by the simulation model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Florida State Energy Office (FSEO) suggested that the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider classifying room air conditioners according to their load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics. (FSEO, No. 42 at 5, 6). The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers stated that regional standards could increase the product's cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by denying manufacturers the economy of large production runs and augment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution problems by isolating inventories by region. (Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 22&hyph;25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department assumes that the Florida State Energy Office comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns regional standards. The Department believes the program requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting of a national standard and is proposing therefore only a national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for room air conditioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Florida State Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office proposed that DOE establish procedures that take into account the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integration of room air conditioners and water heaters (heat recovery units). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Natural Resources Defense Council No. 13 at 29; FSEO No. 42 at 2,3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishing standards and developing test procedures for appliances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which serve two types of loads simultaneously is a very complex problem. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is in the process of developing standards and test procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined central air conditioners and water heaters. However, because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulty of running water lines to a remote room air conditioner location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the inherent heat losses from the hot water line, a room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioner/water heater configuration does not seem particularly appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, DOE will not establish a standard for room air conditioner/water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Florida State Energy Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy stated that DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should consider the cost of peak power in evaluating the cost effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room air conditioner standards. (Natural Resources Defense Council No. 13 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18; Florida State Energy Office No. 42 at 5,6; American Council for an Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficient Economy No. 6 at 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The price of electricity used for room air conditioners is the projected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996 average residential electricity price from DOE Annual Energy Outlook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. Analysis of electricity price by end-use from data in the DOE/EIA 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residential Energy Consumption Survey indicates that the average electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price for residential air conditioning was the same as the national average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential electricity price (in other words, the end-use price multiplier is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.00). Cost effectiveness to the consumer, e.g., life cycle cost, payback and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of conserved energy, is evaluated according to the actual charges to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fedders Corporation urged DOE to establish a minimum energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency ratio for window air conditioners of 10.0, stating that this should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be done to keep the industry competitive on a global basis. The Fedders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation also stated that existing technology clearly can support this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum efficiency at small cost to manufacturers. (Fedders, No. 91 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers responded to the Fedders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation's comment stating that the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers was unclear as to which classes the Fedders Corporation was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring, and urging DOE to maintain and evaluate separate classes of room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air conditioners. Furthermore, the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers stated that the Fedders Corporation cannot accurately judge the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological and economic impacts of such a minimum energy efficiency ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on other manufacturers. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes both comments and has analyzed each proposed class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of room air conditioners separately, using all available cost and performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. The results presented in today's notice as proposed minimum energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency ratio's for room air conditioners range from 9.3 to 11.1, depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on size and configuration.

 There was considerable discussion about water heater product

classes. Many comments came from gas utilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Gas Association urged DOE to adopt a source-based energy

The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act separates water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into three product classes by fuel type: Gas, electric and oil.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Also, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act directs the Secretary to develop different standards for product
classes within an appliance type if they ``consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products within such type.''
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Department did not compare

water heaters of different fuel types. However, the Department considered the

The American Gas Association and many of the gas utilities proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional classes for gas water heaters based on several factors. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included the utility of having hot water if the power fails and the high cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of bringing electricity to locations without electric outlets near the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater. The American Gas Association argued that a precedent already exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with ranges/ovens for separate product classes with or without an electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cord. (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 4&hyph;6.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that DOE should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize the particular utility and performance characteristics of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional gas water heaters and preserve the availability of this product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the American consumer. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two gas utility companies proposed three product classes for gas-fired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters: with a draft hood with and without electric cord, and with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric cord (no designation on presence of draft hood). (Atlantic Gas Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company, No. 29 at 2; and Energen, No. 12 at 4.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some gas utilities proposed two product classes for gas water heaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
namely, with and without electric cord. (Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 1; and Northern Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Arkansas Western Gas Company listed several benefits provided by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standing pilot in water heaters. These benefits include keeping the flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm, helping maintain water temperature in the tank, providing a low-cost, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail-proof ignition system, allowing operation during power outages, and low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating cost. (Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 5.) Piedmont 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Gas Company, Inc. urged the Department to evaluate fully the benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of standing pilot ignition systems. Many citizens in North and South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carolina continued to have hot water and were able to cook after hurricane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hugo caused extensive power outages which lasted up to several weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Piedmont Natural Gas Company, No. 71C at 2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered only one product class for gas-fired storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters. The Department believes that designs that eliminate draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoods or add electric cords do not change the utility of water heaters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, these designs do not warrant inclusion in a separate class. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design options were evaluated solely on economic considerations. Additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation cost to bring electricity to water heaters not close to outlets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was included in the analysis of those design options. When condensation from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-efficiency water heaters would damage masonry chimneys, the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relining or power venting was added to the installation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department does not consider the utility of having hot water, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other amenities, during power outages adequate reason to develop separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product classes. Between 90 percent and 93 percent of residential electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers experience no electricity outages longer than four hours per

The Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional product classes be defined for gas-fired storage water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed outside. (Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not aware of any unique water heater design features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lead to any utility and lower energy efficiency that justifies a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class. Therefore, the Department is not establishing a separate product class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for gas-fired water heaters installed outside. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Power and Edison Electric Institute supported three separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes for electric water heaters (resistance, instantaneous, and heat pump). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Power stated that heat pump water heater efficiency depends upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
climate and use patterns. (Pacific Power, No. 53 at 1, and Edison Electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute, No. 20 at 2). Peoples Natural Gas Company stated that heat pump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters should be promoted over electric resistance water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments proposed that heat pump water heaters be treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design option for electric storage water heaters, and not as a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product class. (DEC International No. 3 at 1; Mr. Wayne Goode, No. 8 at 1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2; and Mr. Warren Widener, No. 78 at 2). Northwest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Power Planning Council proposed a separate product class for add-on heat pumps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for water heaters. (Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that heat pump water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters should not be a separate class. In its comments, the Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council acknowledged some arguments in favor of keeping them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate class, such as the inability to operate at low temperatures, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Natural Resources Defense Council claimed can be overcome with electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance backup; first hour rating, which the Natural Resources Defense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council stated can be overcome with a larger tank; and noise, which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Resources Defense Council suggested can be overcome with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation. The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that these are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic considerations, not product utility considerations. (Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 22). On the other hand, Edison Electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute supported a separate product class for heat pump water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of replacement market considerations, the heat pump compressor may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to be located outdoors, the air temperature must be greater than 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient air circulation is needed (500 cfm) or surrounding air space must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be of sufficient volume (1000 ft3), and there must be provision for condensate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drainage. (Edison Electric Institute, No. 20 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that DOE should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze heat pump water heaters since their shipments are extremely low, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
totaling less than 0.05 percent of all electric water heater shipments. (Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered only one product class for electric storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters. Heat pump water heaters were regarded as design options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric storage water heaters. They provide the same utility as electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance storage water heaters. The Department agreed with the Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council that all of the issues regarding heat pump water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters discussed above are economic in nature, and are treated as such in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department decided a separate product class was not appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
add-on heat pumps. Since this type of heat pump is always used with a storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank, there is no difference in the utility provided to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No detailed information describing the location of electric water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters in existing houses was provided. Lacking better data, DOE assumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient volume of air circulation would be available to allow proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of heat pump water heaters. Most of the heat pump water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in this analysis are currently available. They are all equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with freeze protection and have backup resistance elements. This permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation under adverse conditions. Providing condensate drains was included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the installation costs for all heat pump water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department rejected the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment that heat pump water heaters not be considered in the analysis because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of their low sales volume. The Department would agree with the Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association if heat pump water heaters warranted a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class; however, since they are treated as a design option, DOE concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they warrant consideration. The effect on water heater manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels requiring heat pump water heaters was considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing impact analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The low heating rate of electric instantaneous water heaters presents a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantage with respect to their capability to provide a large quantity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot water as rapidly as an electric resistance storage water heater. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference justified two product classes (instantaneous and all other) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric water heaters. There is little that can be done to improve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of electric instantaneous water heaters. Therefore, standards were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not developed for electric instantaneous water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gas-fired instantaneous water heaters can provide unlimited amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot water, but at limited rates. The Department judged this to be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant difference in utility to the consumer. Gas instantaneous water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters were, therefore, specified as a separate product class, and analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as such for standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
United Technologies Carrier proposed a separate product class for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined space and water heater. Electricity-using design options are viable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for combination appliances, but would cause substantial increases in prices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for gas water heater installations, and would inconvenience many customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(United Technologies Carrier, No. 84 at 1). The Florida Governor's Office and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Northwest Power Planning Council proposed a product class for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desuperheater water heaters. These are popular in Florida and use waste heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from air conditioners. Therefore, they operate only during the cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season. (Florida Governor's Office, No. 42 at 6, and Northwest Power Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission, No. 32 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Department can consider combination space and water heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances and desuperheating water heaters for regulation, test procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be developed and adopted by DOE for such appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, appliances that provide combined services will be examined during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a forthcoming rulemaking on amended standards for central air conditioners and

Design options. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were many comments on the design options for water heaters. A discussion of these comments follows below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Southern Gas Association and other gas companies provided price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates of more efficient water heater designs. For water heaters with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy factors of 0.63, 0.74, and 0.54, the American Gas Association estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uninstalled prices of $667, $729, and $195, respectively. (Southern Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association No. 4 at 4; Energen Corp. and Alabama Gas Corp., No. 12 at 6; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Carolina Electric and Gas Co., No. 34 at 3; Montana-Dakota Utilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Co., No. 54 at 3; Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Columbia Gas provided a comparison of design options, energy factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retail prices for four designs of efficiencies of gas water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These were atmospheric draft/underfired (energy factor .54, $150-$350), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric draft/subchamber (energy factor .62, $250-$500), forced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft/subchamber (energy factor .72, $600-$900), forced draft/immersed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber (energy factor .82, $1300-$1800). (Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used a retail price of $155.48 for the baseline model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an energy factor of .54. This is based on a factory cost of $95.63 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. The 63 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markup from factory cost to retail price was provided by the Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model. Installation expense used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis for the baseline model was $126.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department included a standard venting, submerged combustion chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heater with heat traps, reduced heat leaks and R&hyph;16 insulation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, with an estimated energy factor of .57. At large-scale production, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submerged combustion chamber will not increase the factory cost.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat traps, reduced heat leaks, and R&hyph;16 insulation added $18.19 to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factory cost, for a total factory cost of $113.82. The Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model estimated a markup of about 57 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a total retail price of $179.22.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A model with an energy factor of .74 (calculated to have an energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of .71 using the proposed test procedure) was also included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. This unit has 2 inches of foam insulation surrounding a plastic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank, heat traps, indirect heating of the water, and electronic ignition. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department estimated the factory cost of this unit at large-volume production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be $344.41. This estimate was based on an estimated 16 percent reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in factory costs due to large-scale production. The retail price predicted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Manufacturer Impact Model was $612.96, with a 78 percent markup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A water heater with forced draft and submerged combustion chamber was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not analyzed. However, the Department did consider forced draft with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased baffling. An estimated incremental manufacturing cost of $312.50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. Heat traps, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced heat leaks, and R&hyph;16 insulation were also included on this unit for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy factor of .67 (calculated to have an energy factor of .66 using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed test procedure). A total factory cost of $426.32 was used. A markup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 40 percent from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was applied to arrive at a retail price of $596.83. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was not aware of any existing designs or prototypes for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters with forced draft and immersed chambers. No analysis was done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this design option.

to $200 to add automatic ignition devices and flue dampers to residential gas-fired water heaters. (Wisconsin Blue

Design Options for Storage Water Heaters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rocky Mountain Institute stated that DOE should study insulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure relief valves, plastic drain pipes, and flexible anode rods. (Rocky 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). The Natural Resources Defense Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that DOE evaluate thermal short circuits through insulation. Work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed by the California Energy Commission and the National Institute of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards and Technology showed that the effective thermal resistance is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 percent or less than the thermal resistance calculated from the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduced heat leaks were included as one of the design options in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of water heaters. The actual features of this design option were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified. Measures that could be included in this design option were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate thermal bridges from jacket to feed throughs, to eliminate voids in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation, to insulate the pressure relief valve, to install plastic drain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pipes, and to reduce the number of feed throughs by combining functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures were not modeled separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum panels be considered as a design option. (American Council for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vacuum insulation was considered as one of the design options for both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas-fired and electric storage water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rocky Mountain Institute stated that DOE should study more accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermostats and pipe insulation. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not aware of any method to quantify energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from more accurate thermostats. Pipe insulation, which is not part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heater, was not considered as a design option because of concerns that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it might not always be installed in the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Power stated its research shows that heat traps add only 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent to an electric water heater's efficiency, not 5 percent as assigned in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous DOE testing procedure for water heaters. (Pacific Power, No. 53 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used data from a letter report prepared for DOE.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report determined actual heat losses out of pipe fittings with and without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat traps. The letter reported that heat traps provide a savings of nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
watts on the hot water outlet and seven watts on the inlet. Applied to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline model, this results in a 2.5 percent increase in energy factor.

The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple flues and submerged combustion chamber design options be combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a single category to be called increased heat transfer surface. (Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department found enough difference in efficiency and cost between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these designs to merit classification as individual design options. Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters currently on the market with submerged combustion chambers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery efficiencies of 85 percent, whereas currently available units with

multiple flues have recovery efficiencies of 80 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association recommended that pulse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion and condensation be simplified to condensation of flue gases. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential efficiency improvement is to extract enough heat out of the flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases, such that condensation occurs. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, No 40. at 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that manufacturing costs and actual efficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for design options that condense flue gases depend on the method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensation. Therefore, pulse combustion was retained as a separate design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern Indiana Public Service recommended that pulse combustion and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensation of flue gases be eliminated as design options. While these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs are clearly feasible from a technical standpoint, cost considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have proven to be insurmountable thus far. (Northern Indiana Public Service, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 48 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since pulse combustion and condensation of flue gas technologies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible, the Department cannot eliminate these design options, but has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered their cost impacts using the best available estimates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dampers and intermittent ignition devices be treated as separate designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of concerns about contaminating indoor air with combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products from the pilot light, the Department did not consider flue dampers as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate design option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council proposed that DOE evaluate power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion with intermittent ignition devices. (Natural Resources Defense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council, No. 13 at 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the limited description of this design option, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that the Natural Resources Defense Council was referring to a fan-assisted combustion system using electronic
ignition with the fan before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion chamber. Part of the increase in efficiency from this design is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by the fan restricting off-cycle air flow through the flue. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces off-cycle flue losses. The Department analyzed power vent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent ignition devices, which is a fan-assisted combustion system with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fan after the combustion chamber. The reduction of flue losses would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to the reduction for the design option recommended by the Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern Indiana Public Service also stated that for vent fans, the main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy-conserving value is the reduction of flue losses, and a thermal vent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damper could be used to accomplish that reduction more simply. (Northern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department did not analyze vent dampers, which are above the draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hood, but did analyze flue dampers, which are below the draft hood, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with intermittent ignition devices as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oklahoma Natural Gas proposed that DOE analyze improved burner design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modulating controls, improved flue baffling and improved fill tube designs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce sediment buildup and temperature stacking of heated water. (Oklahoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Gas, No. 57 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was not able to obtain cost and efficiency data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved burner design or fill tube designs. No analysis was done for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modulating controls, because the Department is not aware of how this design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would improve efficiency. Improved flue baffling was included as a design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Rajendra Narang provided patented items for improving the efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gas and oil water heaters. These included preheat of combustion air, self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulating fuel flow to the burner, lower heat input, combustion dampers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better heat exchangers. (Narang, No. 82). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No data on potential energy efficiency improvements or incremental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing costs were available for these design options. In addition, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not able to develop any estimates on the cost or efficiency of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs. Therefore, they were not included in today's proposed rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department requests cost and efficiency data on these designs in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate them for inclusion in the final rule.

Pilot Light Design Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that ``reduced pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light input rate'' should not be considered as a design option because pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inputs have been reduced to the optimal point. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, No. 40 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this issue. Therefore, further reductions in pilot light input rate were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern Indiana Public Service stated that the elimination of a pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light has a very small savings. (Northern Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4). Washington Gas Light Company noted that not all of the heat from a pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light is wasted. (Washington Gas Light Company, No. 37 at 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that only a portion of the heat from a pilot light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is wasted. In the analysis, DOE assumed 76 percent of the pilot light's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy went to maintaining water temperature. This is based on the theory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a pilot light would have the same efficiency as the recovery efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the water heater. Therefore, only the 24 percent of the pilot light input 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to be saved by an intermittent ignition device was included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.

Design Options for Electric Storage Water Heaters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association stated that off-peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters save energy. (National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 17 at 1). Vaughn said that off-peak electric water heaters can save 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy use by controlling time period elements are allowed to heat water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Vaughn, No. 75 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department did include off-peak water heaters as a design option in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Engineering Analysis for electric water heaters. However, as stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the Department believes that the economics of this design option, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the absence of the nationwide availability of time-of-day rates, precludes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using this design option in setting national standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crispaire provided unit energy consumption and annual performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors for heat pump water heaters and electric resistance water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crispaire also stated that its studies showed consumer acceptance of heat pump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters. (Crispaire, No. 19 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department included two existing models of heat pump water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the analysis of electric water heaters. One was an E-Tech brand model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured by Crispaire. Energy consumption for this model was calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the energy factor derived from the DOE water heater test procedure in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect prior to October 17, 1990,
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 derated by 25 percent to account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated reductions due to the current test procedure relative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous test procedure. This derating value was based on estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions of 15&hyph;20 percent from ETL Testing Laboratories,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 27 percent from the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association,
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 and 30 percent from Electric Power Research Institute
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 simulation models. The Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association estimate was based on the difference between data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied in support of the rulemaking and the least efficient heat pump water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater listed in its directory. This is a minimum estimate of the difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department requests test data on heat pump water heaters, in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the existing test procedures, for consideration in the final rule.

electric storage water heaters. Baltimore, Maryland was used as the location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for evaluating the solar water heating systems. Baltimore was chosen as the

Design Options for Instantaneous Gas-Fired Water Heaters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that reducing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of water within instantaneous water heaters would reduce the heater's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to provide sufficient heated water. The Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association further noted that instantaneous water heaters do not utilize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flues to transfer heat to water. Design options which concern flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements are not applicable to instantaneous water heaters. (Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these issues. Reducing the amount of water in the heater and flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements were not considered in the analysis of instantaneous water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council recommended that DOE consider an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent ignition device for instantaneous water heaters as a design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reducing Water Heater Setpoint Temperature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment on design options dealt with a design to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the hot water produced by a water heater. National Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federation proposed that DOE consider the promulgation of a design standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covering the factory setting of water heater temperature controls. It stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F water can cause burns, and reducing this temperature could lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents. In addition, the energy savings would be substantial. (National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Federation, No. 21 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department did not consider the hot water setting as a design option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for water heaters. While it is true that reducing the hot water temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will save energy at the water heater, hot wash cycles in clothes washers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dishwashers with 140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F water are required for certain conditions. All clothes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washers and dishwashers would have to contain electric resistance booster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters to maintain this utility. The use of these electric resistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
booster heaters would mean that some water heating currently being performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by gas water heaters would be performed by electrical resistance heating with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a corresponding loss in overall efficiency.

Other Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fuel switching. One of the most discussed consumer issues involved the impact of increases in initial purchase price
for gas water heaters, since standards could alter consumer fuel choice, resulting in increased electricity consumption
at the expense of gas consumption, and increased environmental degradation. (Middle Tennessee Natural Gas Utility
District, No. 1 at 1; Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, No. 9 at 1&hyph;2; Colorado Interstate Gas Company, No. 14 at
2; Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 1; Wisconsin Blue Flame Council, No. 33 at 1&hyph;2; WGL, No. 37 at 5; Columbia
Gas Distribution Company, No. 45 at 3; Northern Indiana Public Service Company, No. 48 at 4; ENTEX, No. 58 at 2; Peoples

No. 68 at 1; Delta Natural Gas Company, Inc., No. 73 at 1; Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at 4;
and Southern California Gas Company, No. 79 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern was expressed that if standards imposed on gas water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include automatic ignition, requiring electric service, there will be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizeable increase in the prices of gas appliances. The comments argued that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
builders are concerned with initial purchase prices, not life-cycle costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus, a switch to electricity consumption will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is sensitive to fuel-switching issues. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated available data about fuel shares in new housing and replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markets, based on historical purchase patterns, in the Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory Residential Energy Model. Additional data to quantify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity in the market to first cost and to operating cost were obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, sensitivity analyses were performed in the forecast of shipments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters.

expenses in the engineering analyses. The Southern Gas Association, American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gas Association, and Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, among others, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that installation (electric supply and venting alterations) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance for gas water heater designs that would require electricity, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as intermittent ignition device, induced draft combustion, power venting, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensing, must be included in the analyses. (Southern Gas Association, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 at 10; American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3; and Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Gas Association, Southern Gas Association, and several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other gas utilities gave estimates of costs for providing electric service to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a water heater. For an existing appliance location, costs ranged from $75 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$200 and for new construction from $15 to $50. (American Gas Association, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses for electric service could double the installed price of the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 3). On the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand, Flair said that in northern climates, the water heater most likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stands next to the furnace, which has an electrical supply readily and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheaply available to the water heater. Flair estimated that the average price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of adding electricity is much less than the cost of the water heater. (Flair, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 85 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used a cost of $11.20 for the installer to add a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plug-in transformer and install low-voltage wiring to the water heater.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department assumed this would not require an electrician, and would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water heater to be installed a large distance from an existing outlet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would provide sufficient power to run safety controls, spark ignition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flue damper, and a small venting fan. For design options, such as condensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flue gases, submerged combustion, and direct firing, which would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher voltage, a charge of $100 was used as the installation price of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing electricity. This figure was presented to the Department by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern Gas Association.

Modification of Existing Venting Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association mentioned that for water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating systems to be compatible with existing venting systems, recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies must be less than 82 percent. Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association further stated that elimination of the draft hood and installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a new venting system for both a furnace and water heater would modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed price of the water heater by three to five times. (Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association, No.40 at 4). The Gas Research Institute said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional expenses of altering venting systems are necessary for high- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency water heaters. Estimates of these expenses
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 were provided to the Department on a regional basis. (Gas Research Institute, No. 59 at 2&hyph;3).

The Washington Gas Light, Inc. indicated that ``installing a water heater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a vent damper or power combustion into an existing masonry chimney .&blank;.&blank;. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may result in the need to reline the chimney.'' The charge for this would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between $500 and $2000. (Washington Gas Light, Inc., No. 37 at 8). ENTEX 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated installing a new vent system in its service area would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $260. (ENTEX, No. 58 at 5). Energen Corporation estimated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental cost of adding a new vent system at $125 to $175. (Energen, No. 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The charge for relining venting systems that were not type-B was added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the installation expense of all design options with recovery efficiencies

above 80 percent that were not power vented. The Department used values of

$408 for relining masonry chimneys, $85 for replacing vent connectors, and $75 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for adding a sidewall venting system.

Mississippi Valley and Energen stated that when an intermittent ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and flue damper or forced draft combustion are added to a gas water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater, it is likely that at least one of the following components (ignitor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fan motor, printed circuit board, fan relay system, or vent damper assembly) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will fail and need service or replacement in the 10- to 12-year life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heater. (Mississippi Valley, No. 5 at 6; Energen, No. 12 at 8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other comments on the engineering analysis of water heaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energen stated that reliability and functionality issues are most important in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a total system-specific, real world situation. Issues such as venting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, vent categories, common venting, vent-system condensation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion, masonry chimney suitability, backdrafting, spillage, negative room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure, combustion air management, construction clearances, vent termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, heat or flame roll out, flammable vapors ignition, and others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be a significant part of the efficiency equation. (Energen, No. 12 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited data available on component lifetimes suggested failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would occur near the end of the service life of water heaters. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department did not include maintenance expenses in the analysis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department requests data on water heater lifetimes, component lifetimes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service costs for consideration in the final rule.

Baseline Model
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Southern Gas Association and other gas suppliers recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline units and costs. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 8). Energen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said that the baseline unit should logically be a natural draft, non-powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit upgraded to the highest field-proven technology level, including heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traps, advanced insulation techniques, sealing of the pilot light and/or main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner combustion cavity, piezo pilot ignitors, flue dampers and or advanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flue baffling. (Energen No. 12 at 8). Lone Star proposed that shipment data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association be used for baselines. (Lone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Star, No. 39 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The baseline model used in this analysis was established from data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association who was supplied with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data by manufacturers. The baseline represents a typical water heater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that marginally meets the 1990 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The baseline gas-fired storage water heater is a center flue, glass- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lined steel tank with a standing pilot. It has a 40-gallon tank and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1-inch-thick foam insulation. Both the inlet and outlet are at the top of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank. It has six feed throughs and no heat traps. It is bottom-fired with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-inch central flue. The burner input is 34,000 Btu per hour. The pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light input rate is 400 Btu per hour.

Measured Versus Rated Volume
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Energy Commission proposed that the measured volume rather than the rated volume of water heaters
be used in all analyses. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to how the Department should set water heater conservation standards, the California Energy Commission
proposed that any standard be expressed as EF = A + (B * V), and not as EF = A ^ (B * V), so that an exaggeration of volume, V,
by manufacturers would result in a more stringent standard. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Energy Commission also argued that tolerances between rated and measured volumes of 5 percent and
10 percent, respectively, for gas and electricity water heaters volumes, are too high. (California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The energy conservation standards are in the form of equations that are a function of the volume of the water heater.
A footnote refers to the volume as being rated volume. The DOE test procedure contains provisions to determine the
measured or actual volume, but is silent on the rated volume which is established by the manufacturer. The tolerances
to which the California Energy Commission are referring are those set by safety testing agency specifications and
are not related to the energy efficiency program. In the vast majority of cases, the measured volume is lower than the
rated volume. All of the 13 water heaters tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in support of
the DOE test procedure had measured volumes below rated volumes. Furthermore, one out of six electric water heaters
and one out of five gas water heaters tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology exceeded the safety
tolerances for rated volume. (55 FR 42166, October 17, 1990 and 54 FR 1893, January 17, 1989). To conduct the analysis
which forms the basis for today's notice in an accurate manner, the actual volume had to be used. To be consistent with
that analysis, the Department is proposing that the volume referred to in the efficiency equation be the actual or
measured volume. The Department believes that the use of measured volume rather than rated volume in the calculation
will eliminate this issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Energy Commission proposed that the coverage of the water heater test procedures and efficiency standards
be consistent, i.e., the test procedure does not cover some classes and sizes of water heaters that otherwise would
be covered by the efficiency standards. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 2&hyph;3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Direct Heating Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Among the comments on product classes, Southern Gas Association, Energen Corp. and Atlanta Gas Light Company proposed
that direct heating product classes be expanded to separate each present class into two classes, one with and one without
an electric cord. The division of product classes by capacity is not mentioned. Their arguments deal generally with
economic and utility issues, i.e., the ability of products without an electric cord to provide heat if a power outage
occurs, and the affordability of these products to lower-income people. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 6; Energen,
No. 12 at 12&hyph;13; and AGLC, No. 29 at 3). The California Energy Commission stated that there are too many product
classes for this product and proposed three classes which are wall (fan and gravity), floor (fan and gravity), and
room (fan and gravity). (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the Department does not believe that the ability of gas equipment to operate during electricity outages
is a utility that requires separating the existing gravity product classes into those with and without a power cord.
Instead, designs that use electricity are evaluated on their economic advantages and disadvantages. The Department
has kept the four product class categories as designated by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. The categories
are: fan-wall, gravity-wall, room, and floor. With respect to division by capacity, the Department kept the National
Appliance Energy Conservation Act divisions during the engineering analyses. The current class divisions by capacity
are necessary because of the manner in which direct heating equipment is evaluated by the DOE test procedure. The energy
descriptor for this equipment, the annual fuel utilization efficiency, is a function of, among other things, the
pilot fraction. The pilot fraction is defined as the energy input rate to the pilot light (Q
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) divided by the steady-state heat input rate to the heater (Q
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). As the pilot fraction decreases, the annual fuel utilization efficiency will increase. For each of the four categories
of direct heating equipment (fan-wall, gravity-wall, room, floor), the pilot light input rate is constant. Thus,
for heaters of two different capacities within the same category and with the same steady-state efficiency, the annual
fuel utilization efficiency will always be higher for the larger capacity equipment. The division of classes by capacity
is required to account for this relationship between the annual fuel utilization efficiency and the pilot fraction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design options.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that gravity-type direct heating units provide a unique utility
in that they operate during an electrical power outage. In addition, gravity-type equipment can be used where an external
electrical source is not available. Because of these reasons, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association argued
that design options requiring electricity should not be required for floor heaters, room heaters, or gravity wall
furnaces. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association No. 40 at 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the Department does not believe that the ability of gas equipment to operate during electric outages
is a utility that forecloses consideration of electricity-using design options for those appliances. Therefore,
the Department considered, for economic justification, design options that would require electricity for gravity
wall, floor, and room direct heating equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to electronic ignition systems, both Southern Gas Association and North Carolina Public Service Co.
stated that adding an automatic ignition system and electronic controls would add significantly to the price of direct
heating equipment. The Southern Gas Association said it would add $190 while North Carolina Public Service Co. stated
it would add $150 to $200. (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 7; North Carolina Public Service Co., No. 74 at 5). The
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said that intermittent ignition device and vent dampers should
be considered separately. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department took into account all sources of available data when determining the cost of an electronic ignition
system for direct heating equipment. Sources of data included manufacturers, suppliers, utilities, and published
papers and reports. The electronic ignition design option was evaluated not only separately from any other design
option, but also with other design options, including vent dampers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that increased insulation does not improve the energy efficiency
of room heaters since this equipment is located within the heated space. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association,
No. 40 at 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's comment and is not considering the increased
insulation design option for room heaters or wall furnaces. Insulation is only applicable to floor furnaces as this
equipment's intended installation is in an unconditioned crawl space.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association also commented that two-stage or modulating burners reduce the energy
efficiency of direct heating equipment. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, No. 40 at 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's comment. When incorporated into a typical
gravity or forced-air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct heater, i.e., heaters that are currently being manufactured, two-stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modulating burners actually reduce the energy efficiency of direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Two-stage and modulating burners which are currently manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate the gas flow but not the air flow. Excess air is induced at lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas-flow rates, resulting in lower combustion efficiencies when compared to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal or maximum gas flow rate. Because of this, typical heaters equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with two-stage or modulating burners will always have a lower energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency, as measured by the DOE test procedure, than heaters equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single-stage burners. The Department is not aware of any two-stage or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modulating burners that regulate both the gas and air flow. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes however, that it is possible to regulate the air flow being drawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a two-stage or modulating burner if the direct heater is also equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a two-speed or variable-speed combustion fan, i.e., induced or forced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft system. With a multi-speed combustion fan, a low fan speed can be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce the excess air that would normally occur at low gas flow rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the steady-state efficiency that occurs at the high gas flow rate of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-stage or modulating burner can be maintained at its lower gas flow rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since currently manufactured two-stage and modulating burners actually reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy efficiency in typical direct heating equipment, DOE is considering them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a design option only if they are incorporated into a heater already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with a multiple-speed induced or forced draft combustion system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said that DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should consider two-speed or variable-speed blowers. (American Council for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practical application of two-speed or variable-speed blowers is with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-stage or modulating burners. When heating loads are low, both the burner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and the blower speed could be reduced. This would prevent cycling of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit and reduce large fluctuations in room temperature. In addition, overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy consumption could be reduced. As with two-stage and modulating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners, two-speed and variable-speed blowers will also be considered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department only on heaters already equipped with a multiple-speed induced or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forced draft combustion system. This is because two-stage or modulating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation can improve system efficiency only if coupled with a device, i.e., a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multi-speed combustion system that can regulate the air flow rate into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-stage or modulating burner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Carolina Public Service Co. suggested that DOE consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether blowers can be used in direct heating equipment with self-generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilots. (North Carolina Public Service Co., No. 74 at 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not clear to what North Carolina Public Service is referring, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it fails to define clearly in its comment which blower it is discussing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what a self-generating pilot is. A blower could be interpreted as either an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air circulation fan or an induced or power draft fan. The self-generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot is probably some type of electronic ignition device. The Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated all of the above-mentioned design options and has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blowers of any type can be used with electronic ignition systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement unit incorporating an increased heat exchanger surface area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensate must be avoided in the existing vent system. This requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in limiting the combustion efficiency to 83 percent. (Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association, 40 at 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment and considered venting issues in the analysis. Design options that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased the combustion efficiency over 83 percent require an additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation charge to account for venting low-temperature flue gases and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draining condensate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Other comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Southern Gas Association, Energen, and the Atlanta Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light Company recommended baseline units for direct heating equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15,16; Atlanta Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light Company, No. 29 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered these comments regarding baseline units in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering Analysis. Baseline unit efficiency levels for each of the direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating product classes have been set at the standard levels established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. Of the units currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act minimum efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are representative of the efficiency levels that presently exist for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minnegasco said that installation and maintenance expenses for direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating products are important, and that DOE must consider them. (Minnegasco, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 83 at 3).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has considered these expenses in the analysis of direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment. The increase in consumer expenses caused by a design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option includes not only the increase in retail price, but also any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation and maintenance expenses that result from incorporating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design option into the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern Gas Association contended that more efficient direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment would have a severe economic impact on lower-income and elderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers, and that low usage in Southern states should be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 7,10). Minnegasco also commented on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of low usage by urging DOE to consider regional usage when performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the engineering analysis. (Minnegasco, No. 83 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has lowered its usage assumption by using the modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner operating hours contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned above for furnace test procedures. The proposed burner operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours for direct heating equipment has been revised downward to account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regional distribution of this product disproportionately to the southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
half of the Nation. The Department has no data with which to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards' impacts on elderly and lower-income consumers in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a standard level is economically justified; however, DOE will consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the financial effect that the standard has on such consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Advance Notice for this rulemaking, the Department described how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it performs sensitivity analyses to help it understand the effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forecasted impacts because of changes in the exogenous variables and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions. (55 FR 39633). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those sensitivities were developed at the national level, and no effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was made to link them with any specific population groups. With the exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the direct heating equipment analysis discussed above, the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis assumed that nationwide average appliance usage rates, energy prices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and efficiency applied to all consumers in all areas of the nation, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department recognized that there exist large variations in each of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors. The Department seeks additional information concerning the extent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which any proposed national efficiency standard is likely to affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifiable groups of consumers disproportionally and, especially how best to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider such impacts in the selection of efficiency standard levels. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is also seeking additional data to help it better assess the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disproportionate impacts on such groups.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design options. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent ignition device design is not appropriate to mobile home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnaces. The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated there is almost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no flow through the heat exchanger during the off-cycle. If the intermittent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignition device failed, a gas-air mixture could build up and possibly lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an explosion when the intermittent ignition device is activated. (Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department accepted Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment and did not consider an intermittent ignition device plus vent damper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an engineering design for mobile home furnaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy proposed intermittent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignition devices and vent dampers be separately considered and that two-speed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or variable-speed blowers be evaluated. (American Council for an Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has accepted these approaches. The intermittent ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device with fan-forced combustion has been considered as one option, while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion box damper has been considered as a separate option. A combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
box damper has the same effect on efficiency as a vent damper for isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion-type systems. Mobile home furnaces are required to have isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion systems by the Housing and Urban Development code. Both two-stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and continuously modulated burners were included in the final list of design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evcon commented that vent dampers are inappropriate designs because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damper location and isolated combustion design. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered combustion box dampers instead of vent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dampers. The Department knows of no design considerations that would render 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion box dampers inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evcon also suggested that condensing designs and intermittent ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices are inappropriate because of excessive cost. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1&hyph;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has incorporated the costs for materials, components, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance, and installation into the Engineering Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evcon further commented that expense and noise problems exist with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulsed combustion furnaces. (Evcon, No. 76 at 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department acknowledges these points and notes that pulsed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion is no longer on the list of design options. In eliminating this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design option, the Department reasoned that non-pulsed combustion technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can achieve efficiencies equivalent to pulsed-combustion technology at a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost. This is particularly true for manufacturers having to pay patent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royalties for pulse combustion technology. Manufacturing cost data from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers supported this conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, Evcon commented that corrosion and cost problems exist with two-stage and modulating burner designs. (Evcon,
No. 76 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Engineering Analysis, the Department assumed that material costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for the concentric flue/supply air assembly) would increase because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to design for possible intermittent condensation in two-stage non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensing furnaces. Non-condensing modulating furnaces are not included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present list of design options.

Other comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association also commented that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement furnaces must be able to fit into the same spaces as the units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being replaced. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not believe that any of the studied design options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in significant space problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evcon also commented that American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Air-conditioning Engineers Standard 103&hyph;1982 is inadequate for the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of various design options and urged that American National Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute/American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineers Standard 103&hyph;88 be adopted. (Evcon, No. 76 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced above.

Classes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments on classes for conventional ranges and ovens ranged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Aloha Systems Inc.'s recommendation that all electric cooktops be one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product class to Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's proposal to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several classes to those proposed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking. Specifically, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that DOE add, as classes, electric cooktops with grill/griddle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without downdraft feature, and for gas cooktops_grill/griddle with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downdraft feature, grill/griddle without downdraft feature with and without an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric cord, and warming/simmer burners. (Aloha Systems, Inc., No. 2 at 1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 38). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments supported the range/oven product classes that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Four gas utilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern Gas Association, Energen, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company - 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gas Operations, and the Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., all supported the classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected by DOE for gas cooktops and gas ovens. (Southern Gas Association, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 4 at 7; Energen, No. 12 at 14; South Carolina Electric and Gas Company - 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rest of the comments on range/oven product classes argued that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department had proposed far too many different classes in the September 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance notice. As mentioned, Aloha Systems, Inc. recommended a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product class for electric cooktops. The American Council for an Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficient Economy, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Commission, and the Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council all stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there are too many classes for conventional ranges and ovens. (Aloha 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systems, Inc. No. 2 at 1; American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 6 at 1; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 25, California Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission, No. 24 at 5; and Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9). ENTEX proposed that the Department specify freestanding, drop-in, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slide-in ovens and wall ovens as one class. (ENTEX, No. 58 at 6). Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, a manufacturer of ranges and ovens, suggested that DOE not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze those classes with low sales volumes, and instead restrict the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis to the following nine classes: Electric cooktops with open coil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements; electric cooktops with solid disk elements; standard or catalytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric ovens; self-cleaning electric ovens; conventional or sealed burner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas cooktops (with and without power cords); standard or catalytic gas ovens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(with and without power cords) and self-cleaning gas ovens. (Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, No. 31 at 16). Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that three of the classes listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking for gas cooktops, conventional burners with electrical cords, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional burners without electrical cords and sealed burners, should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated into two classes, namely, conventional and sealed burners with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical cords and conventional and sealed burners without electrical cords. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47, 48). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments and reviewing the data, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that many of the classes proposed in the September advance notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not warranted on a utility and performance basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this proposed rule, four product classes were considered for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric cooktops: Low or high wattage open (coil) elements, smooth cooktops, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grill with or without downdraft feature, and griddle with or without downdraft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feature. The baseline cooktop element selected for smooth cooktops is a solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disk element. As compared to open coil element cooktops, smooth cooktops are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much easier to clean. Because cleanability is a consumer utility, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that a separate class is warranted for smooth cooktops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Induction cooking, halogen lamps, and radiant elements were considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design options for smooth cooktops and assessed according to the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of the particular design. Because of the small amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
empirical data on grill and griddle cooktops, the Department was unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze these classes. In addition, the DOE test procedure is presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to measure grill or griddle energy consumption, and the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not proposed to include the testing of grills or griddles. As a result, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is not proposing any standard for these two classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four product classes are now considered for gas cooktops: Conventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners, grill with or without downdraft feature, griddle with or without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downdraft feature, and warming/simmer burners. For other designs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department does not believe that significant utility issues exist, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, in the ability of the appliance to operate during electric outages, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would require that classes be established into gas cooktops with and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without electrical cords. Between 90 and 93 percent of residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity customers experience no electric outages longer than four hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 Designs which use electricity were evaluated on their economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages and disadvantages. Other classes in the Advance Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking (sealed and radiant burners) were considered as design options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional cooktops. There were no utility issues warranting separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes for sealed and radiant burners. As with electric cooktops, because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the small amount of empirical data on grill and griddle cooktops and warming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners, the Department was unable to analyze these classes. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE test procedure is presently unable to measure grill, griddle or warming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner energy consumption, and the Department has not proposed to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of grills, griddles or warming burners. As a result, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not proposing any standard for these three classes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two product classes were considered for electric ovens: Standard ovens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with or without catalytic linings and self-cleaning ovens. Oven types that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were listed as classes in the September 1990 advance notice (forced convection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cooking, forced convection for cleaning, halogen lamp, and steam cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with and without pressure) were considered as design options. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that no utility issues exist warranting additional classes beyond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard and self-cleaning ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with electric ovens, two product classes were considered for gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ovens: Standard ovens and self-cleaning ovens. Oven types that were listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes in the September 1990 advance notice (radiant burner and convection) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were considered as design options. In addition, the Department does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that significant utility issues exist in the ability of the appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to operate during electric outages, which would require that classes be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established into those with and without electrical cords. Designs which use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity are evaluated on their economic advantages and disadvantages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for microwave oven classes, both Whirlpool Corporation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers recommended that the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit its analysis to microwave ovens with and without browning elements, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes which accounted for 96.8 percent of domestic shipments in 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9; Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No, 61A at 30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department rejected the proposals to limit the analysis to two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product classes: conventional microwave ovens with and without browning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements. The Department combined these ovens into one class. Since the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure does not measure the energy use of the browning element, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to separate these two kinds of ovens into classes; therefore, only one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class of microwave ovens was analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design options
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There were numerous comments on the design options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. Natural Resources Defense Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that DOE study (for ranges/ovens) reduction in thermal mass, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic burners, reflective surfaces, the biradiant concept, and improved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnetrons for microwave ovens. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27&hyph;28). Aloha Systems, Inc. said that induction cooking is the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient method. (Aloha Systems, Inc., No. 2 at 1,2). American Council for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that DOE evaluate the infrared jet gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner for conventional ovens, and for microwave ovens, advanced transformer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winding and core materials, and the high-efficiency electronic controller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(which turns power on and off). (American Council for an Energy Efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economy, No. 6 at 4). The Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that DOE study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved controls that allow the resistance element to ``coast'' the food to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion. A reference to European tests was given, stating that this design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires a thermostat and temperature control knob and saves 20 percent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more of the energy. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 5). The Oklahoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural Gas Co. suggested that thermostatically controlled gas burners be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced by various-sized (Btu/h input and dimensions) and manually controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface burners to accommodate different-size cookware. (Oklahoma Natural Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Co., No. 57 at 6). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on each design option for ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 30&hyph;62). Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation supported the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 16, 19).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For gas cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that thermostatically controlled gas burners are not effective at controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature. The sensing element which is designed to make contact with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking vessel will not allow effective control if the cooking utensil has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uneven bottom in the area where it is to be ``sensed.'' In addition, since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric sensing element will retain heat due to its mass, reaction times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be delayed, thus allowing wide swings in the thermostatically selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature. The DOE test procedure also cannot measure the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermostatically controlled burners. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 54, 55.) The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers stated that the performance of reflective surfaces is degraded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly from reaction to cooking vapors, burnt-on spillovers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning with abrasive pads. To maintain reflective surfaces it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to replace these expensive units periodically. The Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers felt that the energy savings from reflective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces are very small. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61A at 56, 57.) With regard to insulation, the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers stated it is occasionally used in gas cooktops where there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface temperature problems on the surrounding structures. The insulation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached outside of the burner box. Any other placement would impair utility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the space underneath the countertop cooktop unit (that is designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit in drawers) would become significantly reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also felt that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy savings from insulation is very small. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 56, 57.) In its comments regarding product classes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, though it suggested that both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional and sealed burners be considered as one class, stated that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect to assume that sealed burners are more efficient than conventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners. Sealed burners obtain all of their secondary air from above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooktop, which requires that either the grate height be raised or the burner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be derated in order for it to be as efficient as conventional burners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47, 48.) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that radiant burners should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered as a product class rather than a design option and went on to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state several problems with these burner types. Since radiant burners use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered pre-mix burner, carbon monoxide control is more critical, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner flame can only be varied by 30 percent. Test work performed by the Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research Institute with the American Gas Association Laboratories on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypes has revealed that low burner rate is difficult to maintain. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means that current prototypes would not meet American National Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute standards. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that burner efficiency might be no better than conventional burners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 49&hyph;51.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department took into account all sources of available data when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the cost and energy savings from thermostatically controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners, reflective surfaces, and sealed burners. Sources of data included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, manufacturers, suppliers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published papers and reports. Lack of any available data regarding catalytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners, high efficiency electronic controllers, and insulation prevented the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department from analyzing these design options. The Department agrees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' comments regarding radiant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas burners. Because there is no prototype that works satisfactorily, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not possible to determine if this design option is technologically feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For electric open coil cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers stated that the contact conductance of open coil elements cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be significantly improved. Manufacturers have worked together to improve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flatness of this element type, and have produced an element that is doing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excellent job. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 57, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58.) The reflective surface and insulation design options cause the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems for electric open coil cooktops as for gas burners. See comments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supra, for gas cooktops. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61A at 58.)

tests based on boiling water have been used to evaluate electronic controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But boiling water tests have yet to be standardized by DOE as a method to rate

cooktops. Therefore, this design option was not analyzed by the Department.

For electric smooth cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers's comments on product classes proposed separate classes for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid disk elements, radiant elements under glass, halogen elements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glass, and induction elements. The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers commented that though solid disk elements are inherently less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient than open coil elements, they should be a separate class because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the additional utility in their ease of cleaning. (Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 39, 40). With regard to radiant and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
halogen elements under glass, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that not only are these cooktops easy to clean because of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smooth surfaces, but additional work space is gained when the cooktop surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not in use. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the recommended cookware for halogen elements are metal pots and pans, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since glass and ceramic cookware are not good heat conductors. (Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 40, 41). The Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers stated that since induction elements heat items by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferring electromagnetic energy, the glass or ceramic countertop under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they lie is unaffected and remains relatively cool. This also means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the cookware used with induction elements must be made from magnetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers listed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following advantages of induction cooking: fast response and control of heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source, ease of cleaning (since food spills do not burn onto the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface), and the ability to heat utensils that are not flat. The Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers pointed out that because the DOE test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure uses non-magnetic aluminum blocks, it is not suitable for testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
induction elements. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.61A at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41&hyph;43). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established two classes for electric cooktops (open coil and smooth), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that radiant, halogen, and induction elements offer no consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility which prevents them from being analyzed as design options for smooth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooktops. Solid disk elements are treated as the baseline unit for smooth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooktops. Data provided by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooktop manufacturers, suppliers, and a published report
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 were used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of smooth cooktops. Data were provided which evaluated radiant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
halogen, and induction elements according to the DOE test procedure. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department test results were obtained for induction elements by attaching a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ferro-magnetic material to the aluminum test block. As with open coil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements, different types of tests based on boiling water have been used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate electronic controls for smooth cooktops. But boiling water tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have yet to be standardized by DOE as a method to rate cooktops. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this design option was not analyzed by the Department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its comments on design options for gas and electric ovens, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that since the DOE test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure does not require maintaining heat in the oven over a period of time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improving the insulation in the cabinet will not show any energy savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 58). With regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced vent size, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this design option should be considered only for electric ovens, not for gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ones. It then proceeded to state how any reductions in vent size will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively impact cooking and baking performance as well as safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 58, 59). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that, according to the DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure, existing instrumentation cannot measure the small energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency gains that result from reducing conduction losses. (Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 59). As with cooktops, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that reflective surfaces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degrade quickly in ovens. This significantly reduces their impact on energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use over the life of the product. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 59, 60). The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers asserted that oven thermal mass cannot be reduced. Further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in the gauge of the oven wall material may result in cracking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat loss. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 60). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that an oven separator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce oven thermal mass would pose potential safety problems due to improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation, gas combustion considerations, and the handling of the separator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the consumer. No test procedure currently exists to certify the safety or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of an oven using a separator. In addition, the Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers questioned the separator's utility, as consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already use microwave and toaster ovens for small loads. The Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers also questioned whether the DOE test procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could evaluate this design option. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 60&hyph;62). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For electric ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed separate product classes for forced convection ovens for cooking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning, halogen lamp ovens, and steam cooking ovens. The Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that due to unique operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics a separate class should be adopted for convection ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 45, 46). With regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to halogen lamp ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that the baking performance is relatively poor compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of a conventional electric oven. But since it may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain advantages for broiling applications, the Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers said it should be a separate class. (Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 46). Since no United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer is currently producing steam ovens and because the food products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be cooked or baked by this oven type are limited, the Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers said it should be adopted as a separate class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established two product classes for electric ovens (standard and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-cleaning), and analyzed halogen lamp, convection, and steam cooking as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design options for electric ovens. The design options commented on by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others have all been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered for electric ovens. This includes the biradiant oven concept that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was referred to by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Data provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, oven manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers, and published reports
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 were used in the analysis of electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ovens. Manufacturers' data supplied by the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers were the only source of cost and efficiency data provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze oven separators. The improved insulation and reduced vent size design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options were analyzed only for standard electric ovens. Insulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement levels and vent size reductions for standard ovens were selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to bring their baseline unit to the same efficiency level as the baseline unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected for self-cleaning ovens. The Department received no data that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that insulation could be improved beyond the baseline level for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-cleaning ovens. In addition, any further reductions in vent size were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed to jeopardize both oven safety and cooking performance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department did not receive any energy-use or cost data concerning the halogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lamp and steam cooking design options, thus preventing them from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed for electric ovens.

For gas ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate product classes for standard and self-cleaning convection ovens and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiant burner gas ovens. As with electric convection ovens, the Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers said the unique operating characteristics of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the convection oven warrant a separate class. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 53). For radiant burner gas ovens, the Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers made reference to its comments on radiant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burners for gas cooktops. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61A at 53). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established two product classes for gas ovens (standard and self-cleaning). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that convection and radiant burner gas ovens should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed as design options. A separate class would be warranted if lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient design options had consumer utility relative to convection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiant burner gas ovens. The design options commented on by the Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Home Appliance Manufacturers and others have all been considered for gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ovens. The bi-radiant oven concept referred to by the Natural Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defense Council was determined to be applicable to electric ovens only.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data provided by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, suppliers, and published reports
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 were used in the analysis of gas ovens. Manufacturers' data supplied by the Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers were the only source of cost and efficiency data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided with which the Department could analyze oven separators. As with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric ovens, the improved insulation and reduced vent size design options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were analyzed only for standard gas ovens. The Department did not receive any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy-use or cost data concerning the radiant burner gas oven, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing it from being analyzed.

For microwave ovens, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that high-grade stainless steel (or reflective material steel coating) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be more efficient than painted cold-rolled steel by approximately one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 30&hyph;33). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that a small efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement may be available if fan air flow is increased or if motor energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption is decreased. (Id. at 32). The Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers said that magnetron efficiency has reached its maximum at 72 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. (Id. at 33). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that solid-state power supplies are not more efficient, but cost more. At low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power levels, improved performance is expected because they eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on/off cycling used by other power supplies. (Id. at 34). The Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that there are no data available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggest that solid-state microwave generators would increase the generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency over the 70+ percent efficiency available in today's magnetrons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Id. at 34). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified wave guide may decrease energy absorption by one percent. (Id. at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that microwave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oven models with fan-type stirrers use a cover over the fan to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertent damage to the fan when inserting or removing food and to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degradation of the wave guide due to food splatter. While these ceramic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stirrer covers may absorb some microwave energy, they are essential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protecting the stirrer and to prevent accumulation of food splatter inside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wave-guide. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A at 35). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has utilized the Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers's estimates for energy savings from improved magnetrons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflective surfaces, modified wave guides, and more efficient fans. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers's comments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has also excluded solid-state microwave generators and modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food stirrers from its cost/efficiency tables. The Department has generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for, and included a more efficient power supply in, its cost/efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis for microwave ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arkansas Western Gas said that maintenance and installation should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. (Arkansas Western Gas, No. 64 at 7).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintenance and installation costs were considered for ranges and ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department determined that the only design option which required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional maintenance costs was electronic ignition for gas cooktops. Using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data obtained from electronic ignition manufacturers, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established a price for replacing malfunctioning electronic ignition devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A retirement function based on data received from electronic ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers and service technicians was used to establish the rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of these control devices. With the retirement function and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement cost, the expected maintenance expense was then determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Rajendra Narang provided patents for improving the efficiency of gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges/ovens. These included, for ovens: Combustion air preheated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge gases, heated discharge gases discharged only when combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs, and circulation fans for better airflow; for cooktops: an efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piloted ignition and flame containing burner rings to support pots and pans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Narang, No. 82). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was not able to assess the energy savings from most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the design options presented by Mr. Narang. (Circulation fans were analyzed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however.) Experimental data and simulation models were not available to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of these design options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the usage assumptions for ranges/ovens be decreased to account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in lifestyles since the original usage values were estimated. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said the reductions in energy use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are from 68 to 74 percent for cooktops and ovens. (Association of Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61 at 38). Whirlpool Corporation stated that DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should revise the test procedure to account for lower usage; the present test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure overstates usage for cooktops and ovens by 70 and 76 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 17). The American Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an Energy Efficient Economy also recommended that the usage values be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updated. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Arkansas Western Gas said range use is down, and that gas use is so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low (6Mcf) that any conservation item will have little effect. (Arkansas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western Gas, No. 64 at 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, the Department has proposed revised test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for kitchen ranges and ovens. The Department used the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure, including the more current field usage numbers, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses in today's notice. The new annual useful cooking energy output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values were determined to be 209.4 kWh for electric cooktops, 732.5 kBtus for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas cooktops, 35.5 kWh for electric ovens, and 124.2 kBtus for gas ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential microwave oven standards, the Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers contended that such standards would have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insignificant effect on energy consumption. (Association of Home Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers, No. 61A at 29). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department analyzed quantitatively the energy-saving potential of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards on microwave ovens and found that significant savings are possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See Technical Support Document, Chapter 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the usage values for microwave ovens, Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation stated that microwave energy use has increased significantly, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE should initiate a new study to determine a reasonable estimated energy use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for microwave ovens. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 19). Citing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electronic Industries Association's estimated 100 kWh/yr usage for microwave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ovens in 1987, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was consistent with its 1976 data showing 75 kWh/yr usage because, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average family size has decreased, microwave oven use within the household has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 27). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the usage number for conventional ranges and ovens, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department used the proposed test procedure usage values for the analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microwave ovens. The Department obtained the proposed energy use values from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several utility conditional demand studies resulting in the proposed usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of 270 kWh/yr for microwave ovens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, some comments urged changes in the ranges and ovens test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure as well as the microwave oven test procedure. Aloha Systems, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commented that the present test procedure using an aluminum block is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realistic, and that induction cooking cannot be evaluated with the present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure since that procedure requires iron pots and pans. (Aloha 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systems, Inc., No. 2, at 2). Whirlpool Corporation and the Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home Appliance Manufacturers both urged the Department to change its microwave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure to the 1988 International Electrotechnical Commission test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for measuring microwave power and energy use. (Whirlpool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, No. 31 at 18; Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers No. 61A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 25.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modifications to the test procedures for kitchen ranges and ovens, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to comments on pool heater classes, Southern Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, Energen, South Carolina Gas and Electric, Laclede, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oklahoma Gas Co. proposed that an additional product class for pool heaters be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established_gas pool heaters with automatic ignition. (Southern Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15; South Carolina Gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electric, No. 34 at 6; Laclede, No. 55 at 6; and Oklahoma Gas Company, No. 57 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes there is no significant difference in consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility between gas-fired pool heaters which use electricity and those which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not. In addition, pool heaters are customarily installed adjacent to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pump and filter. Therefore, electricity will be readily available for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool heater. The Department decided to keep gas-fired pool heaters as one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class and to consider electricity-using design options as another design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. Accordingly, the installation and maintenance expenses (in addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to increased manufacturer costs) associated with design options using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity were considered in the economic calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another product class issue dealt with heat pump pool heaters. Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Heat Systems (Air Energy Heat Systems, No. 44 at 1) provided efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. The company stated that coefficients of performance are available in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mid five's and will reach the low six's in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has adopted American National Standards Institute Standards Z21.56&hyph;1989 and Z21.56a&hyph;1990
as the test procedure for pool heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American National Standards Institute standards apply to gas-fired pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters only, not electric resistance pool heaters or electric heat pump pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters. Since a test procedure does not exist for electric pool heaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients of performance data were not used in the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design options. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for pool heater design options, the Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association argued that since pool heaters have ``no flues,'' many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the design options listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate, such as use of flue dampers, multiple flues, and increased flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baffling. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most pool heaters currently being manufactured pass the water through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat exchanger pipe which is located inside a combustion chamber above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner. This design does not have a flue, and would not benefit from design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options to improve the flue. The Department agrees with Gas Appliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association and is not considering these design options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One company took issue with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association's comments about flue dampers not being an appropriate design for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool heaters. Flair said, ``We know of several manufacturers who build boiler-type pool heaters equipped with flues.''
(Flair, No. 85 at 1.) Flair also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the Department evaluate a water heater design option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic ignition with a flue damper for pool heaters. (Flair, No. 85 at 2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not aware of any residential pool heaters being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured currently with separate boilers or tanks that store water at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevated temperatures. Flue dampers are effective only at reducing standby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses from storage tanks. Therefore, flue dampers were not considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automatic ignition was included as a design option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment dealt with pool heater test procedure issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Energy Commission stated new test procedures are needed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil-fired, electric resistance, and heat pump pool heaters, and the gas-fired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool heater test needs to include standby losses so that intermittent ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices are credited for increasing the energy factor. (Commission Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission, No. 24 at 5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modifications to the test procedures for pool heaters, which address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these issues, are contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking referenced

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, one comment proposed that pool heaters be brought under the appliance labeling program. (California Energy
Commission, No. 24 at 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department notes that the appliance labeling program is administered by the Federal Trade Commission.
It will be the Federal Trade Commission's decision, not the Department's, whether to bring pool heaters under labeling
requirements.

In a final rule regarding standards for three types of appliances, including clothes washers, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 14, 1991 (56 FR 22250), the Department announced that it was accelerating the second review of energy efficiency
standards for clothes washers. In response to that notice, a number of energy-efficiency advocates and appliance
manufacturers requested that the Department delay the second review until 1995&hyph;96.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 The additional time was requested in order to allow manufacturers time to implement the standards imposed by the 1991
final rule and to fully evaluate new, more energy-efficient technologies such as top-loading horizontal-axis clothes
washers. This additional time, manufacturers contend, will enable them to provide more meaningful and relevant
comments on the next, legislatively required rulemaking. The Department considered the request, and by letter,
dated February 26, 1992, notified the parties requesting the delay that the Department had determined that it will
conduct the rulemaking on the later schedule, as requested.

Classes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several fluorescent ballast class issues were raised in the comments on the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
One comment supported the Department's proposed classes. (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 2). On the other hand, a
number of comments recommended additional classes for fluorescent lamp ballasts based on the size and type of lamp
for which the ballast is designed. One set of comments proposed adding three and four-lamp F40T12 ballasts and F32T8
ballasts as product classes. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 2; Public Citizen, No. 7 at
3; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 26; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3; California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 6; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; and Sierrra Club, No. 43 at 2). Several comments proposed
adding ballasts for compact fluorescent lamps as a product class. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 26;
Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2; and Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2). Lastly,
three comments proposed that dimming features on ballasts warrant a separate class, since such ballasts provide
the utility to vary light output. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy No. 6 at 5; California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 7; Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department has added three and four-lamp F40T12 ballasts and one, two, three, and four-lamp F32T8
ballasts to the list of product classes. These new classes will all have unique ballast efficiency factors. Compact
fluorescent ballasts, however, are integrated with a lamp and sold as one package. As such, one cannot determine the
efficiency of the ballast separate from the lamp. Although dimming ballasts do provide a unique utility to vary light
output, the Department believes that such ballasts do not warrant a separate class. At full light output, their energy
efficiency is expected to be equal to that of non-dimming ballasts. Therefore, any standard developed for non-dimming
ballasts will apply to dimming ballasts operated at full light output.

Design options.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comments on the fluorescent lamp ballast design options consisted largely of suggestions of additional designs
for the Department to consider. Certified Ballast Manufacturers stated that it feels there are only two design options,
electromagnetic and electronic. (Certified Ballast Manufacturers, No. 47 at 2). Four comments proposed improvement
of magnetic ballasts through the use of lower resistance conductors and low-loss silicone or amorphous steel core
material. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; Valmont Electric, No. 16 at 1; California
Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 5). A number of comments suggested
that design options which reduce energy use of magnetic ballasts through cathode (heater) cutout, including use
of electronic controls (hybrid ballasts), be considered. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No.
6 at 5; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 17 at 29; Valmont, No. 16 at 1; California Energy
Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 5). The California Energy Commission stated
that instant start should be considered as one of the design options for magnetic ballasts. (California Energy Commission,
No. 24 at 7). There were several comments regarding the consideration of levels of efficiency of electronic ballasts
as design options such as instant start and use of integrated circuits. (American Council for an Energy Efficient
Economy, No. 6 at 5; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Sierra Club, No. 16 at 2; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 17 at
29; Valmont, No. 16 at 1; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at
5). Finally, three comments proposed that dimming capability (task tuning) be considered as a design option of electronic
ballasts. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7;
and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dimming capability (task tuning) is addressed above in the product class discussion. The analysis treated cathode
cutout and instant start for magnetic ballasts, as well as lower resistance conductors and low-loss steel cores,
as design options. The Department also analyzed one efficiency level for instant start and one for rapid-start electronic
ballasts. The Department concluded that the use of integrated circuits as a substitute for discrete components is
common enough to be included in the initial electronic ballast design option.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two comments recommended that energy-efficient magnetic ballasts be used as the baseline for all product classes.
(Valmont, No. 16 at 1; and Magnetek Universal, No. 35 at 1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with these recommendations and used energy-efficient magnetic ballasts for the baseline
units for all classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments advised against the Department's considering standards to reduce the harmonic distortion of fluorescent
lamp ballasts. (Valmont, No. 16 at 3; Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 4; Magnetek, No. 35 at 2; and National Electrical
Manufacturers Association, No. 41 at 1). These comments contended that the harmonic distortions caused by fluorescent
lamp ballasts, presently less than 30 percent, are not a serious problem, and that options designed to reduce such
distortions would not be cost-effective. (Both magnetic and electronic ballasts generate harmonic distortion.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department treated the harmonic content for electronic ballasts as acceptable for conventional, i.e., non-compact,
ballasts and did not assign any additional cost to achieving reduced harmonic distortion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the fluorescent ballast test procedure, Advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transformer and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is presently no test procedure for electronic ballasts. (Advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transformer, No. 25 at 2; National Electrical Manufacturers Association, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used the present test procedure for magnetic ballasts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure the ballast efficacy factor of electronic ballasts. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that the 60 hertz input power measurement and the light output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement are the same, regardless of the type of ballast (low or high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency). The Department believes that the existing test procedure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to measure the ballast efficacy factor of electronic ballasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three manufacturers provided energy savings estimates for various design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options. Energy Advantage stated that 20 percent savings from electronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballasts, compared to energy-efficient magnetic ballasts, are possible. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, this energy savings can be accomplished with up to a 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in lifetime. (Energy Advantage, No. 27 at 1). Magnetek said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses for a two lamp F40 electronic ballast can be reduced from 5&hyph;6 watts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 3.5&hyph;4.5 watts, for a savings of 1.25&hyph;1.5 watts out of 56&hyph;58 watts, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution of an integrated circuit for discrete components. (Magnetek, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35 at 1). One other company, Valmont, provided energy savings tables for five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballast product classes, their maximum technologically feasible efficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the costs of achieving those efficiencies. (Valmont, No. 16 at 4&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department used some of the above data in combination with data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directories and other published data
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 to determine energy savings for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various classes of fluorescent ballasts. (See Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume B). The Department found that 10&hyph;15 percent energy savings from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic ballasts, relative to energy-efficient magnetic ballasts, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. The Department developed data that indicated larger energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are possible with electronic ballasts than were estimated by Valmont. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in higher maximum technologically feasible efficiencies for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballast product classes than provided by Valmont. The Department used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental manufacturer costs that were specific to the energy efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gains estimated for each ballast product class studied, and, therefore, did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not use the cost data provided by Valmont. A more detailed discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions and analysis used for this product class are provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document. As for lifetimes of ballasts, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed the lifetime for an electronic ballast to be equal to that of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnetic ballast, since no experimental data were received or found to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiate their lifetimes.

Three manufacturers suggested that some combination of education and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls would be superior to standards in saving lighting energy use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advance Transformer contended that fluorescent ballasts do not belong in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking, and that improved education about lighting will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish more than standards. (Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 1). Magnetek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Certified Ballast Manufacturers both stated that controls, i.e., occupancy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensors, light feedback, daylighting, and automatic timers, can save more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy than can more stringent ballast standards. (Magnetek, No. 35 at 1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certified Ballast Manufacturers, No. 47 at 2).

in this rulemaking, more stringent fluorescent ballast standards and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concomitant energy savings therefrom. The Department considered such programs

. The Natural Resources Defense Council, Rocky Mountain Institute, and Thomson commented on television set class
delineations. The Natural Resources Defense Council stated that separate classes may be needed for stereo sound,
remote control, and other features. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No 13 at 24). Also, the Rocky Mountain Institute
stated that it might make sense to differentiate on the basis of features like remote control, electronic tuning,
and stereo sound. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thomson stated that the large number of necessary variables or items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to classify television receivers, including, for example, feature content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and screen size, would greatly complicate any attempt to categorize television 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receivers in order to establish meaningful energy usage guidelines. Thomson 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also said that many customer-preferred performance qualities, such as high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
picture brightness and high-quality stereo sound consume correspondingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher levels of power than television sets that do not exhibit those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualities. There are other desirable, if not necessary, features, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remote control and on-screen function displays, and federally mandated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
features, such as closed caption decoding, that may increase energy use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Thomson, No. 49 at 3, 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Electronic Industries Association stated that in 1989, 83 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
color television sets sold to dealers reportedly included a remote control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feature and that virtually all television sets use electronic tuning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 3, 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Department established one class for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
color television sets with electronic tuning and remote control. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that the energy used to illuminate the screen is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by screen size and, therefore, has proposed standards for television 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sets that are a function of screen size. Furthermore, DOE believes that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no need to separate classes according to stereo sound because the sound is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not on during the efficiency test and therefore sound energy does not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard level analysis is based primarily on manufacturers' data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 19/20
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; color television sets because recent manufacturer cost and energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use data for other screen sizes were very limited. The results of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, based on the 19/20
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; color television sets and the limited data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for other screen sizes ranging from 13.5
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; to 33
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;, were then used to derive the proposed standards as a function of screen size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department did not consider standards for black and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
white television sets since their share of the market is rapidly decreasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and over 50 percent of those sold are designed for battery or battery-AC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation and are thus designed to minimize energy use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design options
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Among the comments on television set design options, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that DOE consider all reasonable options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing standby power as well as operating power. One option would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a clearly labeled switch that would give consumers the choice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turning the set to standby or completely off. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 at 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy suggested that DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze use of a step down transformer rather than a resistance circuit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic tuning and new transformer materials with low core loss (amorphous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alloys). The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy also urged DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to look at television sets in other countries, particularly Germany. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3&hyph;4). The Natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Defense Council proposed that DOE consider power supply efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvement. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 38).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Electronics Industry Association said that average remote control power is 4W, while some are as low as 2W; electronic
tuning uses less than 1W, brightness sensor less than 1W. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 3&hyph;4).
Thomson said that remote control uses 3&hyph;6W and that a brightness sensor consumes essentially no power in itself
and offers no energy benefit not otherwise available to the consumer by using the customary picture control adjustments.
(Thomson, No. 49 at 6, 7). The Electronic Industries Association provided data on voltage-regulating power supplies.
It said that a change in the type of regulator from shunting to switching can save approximately six watts at an additional
cost of $1.50. Other comments were provided for other design options, but no additional data were submitted. (Electronic
Industries Association, No. 30 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered all comments on design options by analyzing standby power; power supply efficiency improvements,
including voltage-regulating power supplies; and step down transformers for electronic tuning. These design options
are shown in the cost/efficiency tables in the Technical Support Document. Data submitted by the Electronic Industries
Association and previously submitted data from manufacturers were used to develop these tables. While a switch to
allow consumers to turn off the remote control portion of the television (suggested by the Rocky Mountain Institute)
would likely save some energy, the amount would be determined by consumer behavior and is not predictable. The Department
discovered no data on improved transformer materials with low core loss nor any data on the energy use, as measured
according to DOE test procedure, for the German models. The Department did develop data on Japanese models measured
according to its test procedure. These data were included in the analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments questioned the feasibility of establishing energy conservation standards for television sets.
The Electronic Industries Association said that television set efficiency has improved over the years because manufacturers
have been steadily limiting power to reduce internal heat. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 2). Thomson
said there is little, if any, opportunity for further reductions in energy use. Thomson also said the major factors
that influence energy use are controlled by the consumer: Operating hours, brightness, sound level, and control
settings. (Thomson, No. 49 at 2&hyph;6). The Electronic Industries Association argued that efficiency standards
would impede the development of high definition television. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 6). G&amp;A
Consultancy suggested that DOE ``not place retarding restrictions upon television sets because precluding the
television set's potential role as an energy control may inadvertently deny the American homeowner a far more valuable
system of energy savings.'' (G&amp;A Consultancy, No. 50 at 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered all these comments in the decision-making process for television set standards. With
regard to such standards precluding the potential for a television set to become a home energy controller, it is the
Department's belief that if television sets were transformed to home energy controllers, the nature of the appliance
might have changed sufficiently for it to be considered a new appliance. If so, it would not be a covered product and
subject to an energy conservation standard for television sets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that standards are inappropriate for television sets, stating that they already are energy efficient,
leaving little room for improvement. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 7; Thomson, No. 49 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department analyzed television set standard levels by the methodology proposed in the advance notice, thereby
taking into account the costs and benefits of any potential efficiency improvements. The Department found that the
efficiency of the typical television set can be improved.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners in today's notice, the Department selected a class of room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced for the representative class. The representative class for room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air conditioners is room air conditioners with side louvers, less than 6,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BTU's per hour, which is one of the most prevalent classes of room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners. For this representative class, trial standard levels 1 and 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the above efficiency improvements from the baseline by enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporator and condenser fins and the use of a permanent split-capacitor fan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor; level 3 adds a subcooler and grooved tubes to both the evaporator and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser coils; level 4 increases the compressor energy efficiency ratio to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.0; level 5 increases the compressor energy efficiency ratio further to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.5; level 6 increases the evaporator and condenser coil area; and level 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adds a variable-speed compressor and brushless DC fan motor. Similar design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the other classes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are found tabulated in Section 1.4 of the Technical Support Document.

Table 4&hyph;2 presents the payback periods for the

this representative class, standard levels 1 through 4 satisfy the rebuttable

less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of room air

3. Significance of Energy Savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To estimate the energy savings by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result for all classes of the product:

Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The per unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the efficiency of levels 1 and 2 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the representative class is $3.81; to meet levels 3&hyph;7, the manufacturers' cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases are $10.10, $11.75, $23.42, $50.24, and $210.24, respectively. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document, Table 1.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are $4.77 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for levels 1 and 2 and $13.64, $15.43, $32.55, $54.61, and $220.04 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels 3&hyph;7, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 1 and 2 is $5.12 for the representative class; standard level 3 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce energy expenses by $9.13; standard level 4 by $9.73; standard level 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by $11.16; standard level 6 by $12.41; and standard level 7 by $16.10. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all classes of room air conditioners show that revised standards would cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypical manufacturer to have some reductions in short-run return on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity from the 8.6 percent return in the base case. Standard levels 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 7 are projected to produce short-run return on equity's of 8.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, 8.5 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.4 percent, 5.2 percent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minus 4.3 percent, respectively. However, revised standards have little or no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on the prototypical manufacturer's long-run return on equity. Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 1 through 7 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 8.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 8.6 percent, 7.9 percent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.1 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-cycle cost and net present value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A life-cycle cost is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate standard levels, a unit meeting level 4 has the lowest consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Figure 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard levels 1 and 2 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the average affected consumer of $38.86 for the representative class of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room air conditioner; standard level 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by $54.75; standard level 4, by $56.68; standard level 5, by $53.47; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 6, by $43.47. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no standard level, other than max tech, would cause any economic burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average consumer. At standard level 7, the life-cycle costs are projected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase $86.09, compared to the base case. See Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 4.13. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely face in financing the purchase of room air conditioners. Similarly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.

The Net Present Value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that for all classes of room air conditioners, standard level 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would produce an NPV of $0.44 billion to consumers. The corresponding net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present values for standard levels 2&hyph;6 are $0.82 billion, $1.59 billion, $1.68 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The expected environmental impacts of the candidate standard levels were calculated prior to passage of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, November 15, 1990). As explained below, the CAAA will lower
emissions of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since appliance standards reduce the need for generation of electricity, they will cause lower emissions by powerplants
of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, thereby helping those utilities meet their required pollution reductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, any emission reductions caused by appliance standards prior to the year 2000 will be part of much greater SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions that are required by the CAAA. After the year 2000, SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions achieved through appliance standards or any other means by those emitting SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be earned as credits. These are credits to emit an amount of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 equivalent to the amount of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction that created the credits. The new amendments allow those earning the credits either to sell them to others
or to ``bank'' them for future use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, after the year 2000, to the extent that appliance standards result in SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 credits being earned, and to the extent that such standards_induced credits are sold and used by others, the national
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions from standards will not occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new law also requires that utility boilers emit lower levels of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and requires that additional actions to reduce emissions be taken in regions not now in compliance with Federal ambient
air quality standards for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 or derivative pollutants, such as ground-level ozone. Because of these new requirements, the actual reductions
in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions likely to result from the appliance standards are very likely to be substantially less than the estimates
made prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 and contained in this document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, there are as yet no such regulatory constraints on national or regional emissions. However, efforts to comply with
international commitments to stabilize CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, such as voluntary commitments by utilities and industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990
levels by 2000, may result in constraints that are similar in nature to those for SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be 47,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels
2&hyph;7, the reductions are 103,000 tons; 205,000 tons; 234,000 tons; 353,000 tons; 467,000 tons; and 698,000 tons,
respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be 24 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels
2&hyph;7, the reductions are 53 million tons; 105 million tons; 119 million tons; 181 million tons; 240 million tons;
and 360 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity
generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely
to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 4.91 million
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;7, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be
10.76, 21.5, 24.45, 37.14, 49.21 and 73.69 million barrels, respectively.

5. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards
that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically
feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,
i.e., standard level 7 for amended room air conditioner standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 7 would save the most energy (5.22 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet
this standard, the Department assumes that all room air conditioners would incorporate improved and increased heat
transfer devices and high efficiency and variable-speed fan motors and compressors. However, the payback at this
standard level of 16.1 years for the representative class, and up to 23.9 years for other classes, exceeds the 15-year
life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of $86 for the representative class, and up to $178 for other
classes. This level also drives the short-run manufacturer return on equity from 8.6 percent to negative 4.3 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 7 for room air conditioners outweigh the benefits,
and rejects the standard level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 6. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save 3.06 quads of energy. This level produces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life-cycle cost savings compared to the base case of $43, with a payback of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.3 years, which is slightly more than one third of the average product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lifetime. However, this level causes payback as high as 9.1 years for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes (over 60 percent of product life) and reduces manufacturer short-run 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return on equity from 8.6 percent to 5.2 percent, a reduction of almost 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. Also, at this standard level, some classes are assumed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate variable-speed compressors, for which there is not a DOE test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure. The Department believes that the development of such a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure would be a lengthy process which would probably delay the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the standard for room air conditioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for room air conditioners outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for room air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioners with standard level 5 for room air conditioners. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that standard level 5 for room air conditioners saves a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.22 quads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 353,000 tons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
394,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.18 percent each by the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 181 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons, or as much as 0.18 percent, over the forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer payback of this standard level is 3.5 years for the representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class and no more than 7.0 years for any class. This standard is at or near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $53 for the representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class. Additionally, the standard is expected to have essentially no impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department examined a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of standard levels for water heaters. Table 4&hyph;3 presents the efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels selected for analysis for the four classes of water heaters. Electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gas storage water heaters each have five efficiency levels that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed, but were paired together to yield the eight combinations shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. Level 8 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in the engineering analysis for each class.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of water heaters in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's notice, the Department selected two classes of water heaters as being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative, or typical, of the product, and is presenting the results only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those classes. The results for the other classes can be found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative classes. The representative classes for water heaters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric storage water heaters and gas storage water heaters, which are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most prevalent classes of water heaters. For electric storage water heaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline by the use of heat traps and by reducing heat leaks; level 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the insulation level to R&hyph;25; at level 3 the insulation is reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back to the baseline level of R&hyph;16, but an add-on heat pump is added; levels 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 5 increase the insulation back to R&hyph;25; and levels 6, 7 and 8 assume the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of an integral heat pump. For gas storage water heaters, trial standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 is the same as the baseline, trial standard level 2 accomplishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above efficiency improvement by the use of heat traps and by reducing heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks, levels 3 and 4 increase the insulation level to R&hyph;16, levels 5 and 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the insulation level to R&hyph;25, at level 7 the insulation level is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced back to R&hyph;16 but electronic ignition is added, and at level 8 the flue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases are assumed to condense. Similar design options are used to achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above efficiencies for the other classes and are found tabulated in Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5 and 1.6 of the Technical Support Document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To estimate the energy

savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new water heaters under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

. The per

water heaters is zero since it is the same as the baseline; to meet level 2

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases for gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters are zero for level 1, since it is the same as the baseline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$7.35 for level 2, $24.05 for levels 3 and 4, $59.60 for levels 5 and 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$108.55 for level 7 and $901.80 for level 8. For electric water heaters the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer price increases are $6.85 for level 1, $42.04 for level 2, $361.36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for level 3, $394.38 for levels 4 and 5, and $834.31 for levels 6 through 8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 is zero for a gas water heater because it is the same as the baseline; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.87; standard levels 3 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 by $7.46; standard levels 5 and 6 by $9.20; standard level 7 by $13.32; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 8 by $53.02. For electric water heaters standard level 1 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce energy expenses by $14.66, standard level 2 by $26.78, standard level 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by $195.01, levels 4 and 5 by $207.13 and levels 6 through 8 by $250.79. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and
4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturers Impact Model results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all classes of water heaters show that any of the revised standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause a prototypical manufacturer to have negative short-run return on equity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is caused in part by the very low base case return of 0.4 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicative of an industry which is extremely price-competitive. The negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-run return on equity's are especially severe at the three most stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce negative short- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run return on equity's of 0.2 percent, 0.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.5 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.7 percent, 17.1 percent, 18.1 percent and 31.7 percent respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, revised standards will slightly increase the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's long-run return on equity at standard levels above level 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce long-run return on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity's of 0.4 percent, 0.4 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.6 percent, 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, most financial data of the type needed to characterize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports. Also, DOE based its assumptions for the prototypical firm strictly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on information regarding water heater manufacturers. The Department seeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on how to better characterize a prototypical firm when heat pump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters are included in the mix of products. For example, it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that room air conditioner manufacturers become the system manufacturer, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water heater tank becoming a purchased part. In that case, at those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels where heat pumps are assumed, it may be reasonable to introduce some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the financial characteristics of the room air conditioner industry since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat pumps in question are very similar to room air conditioners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-cycle cost and net present value
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A life-cycle cost is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 8, the max tech level, for gas water heaters are less than the baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. Of the eight candidate standard levels, units meeting levels 4 and 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for electric water heaters and units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting levels 3 and 4 have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for gas water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters. See Technical Support Document, Figures 4.2 and 4.1.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average consumer of $70.39 for the representative class of electric water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters with no impact on gas water heaters, which remain at the base case at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this level; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $81.04 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and $19.13 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively; standard level 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by $974.88 and $29.81; standard level 4, by $1024.20 and $29.81; standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 5, by $1024.20 and minus $3.77; standard level 6, by $907.99 and minus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3.77; standard level 7, by $907.99 and minus $13.12; and standard level 8, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$907.99 and minus $437.41. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level, other than levels 5 through 8 for gas water heaters, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document, Tables 4.5 and 4.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely face in financing the purchase of water heaters. Similarly, DOE did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard
is to be a national standard, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that for all classes of water heaters, standard level 1 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a net present value of $0.19 billion to consumers. The corresponding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net present values for levels 2&hyph;8 are $0.99 billion, $40.17 billion, $42.92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billion, $42.68 billion, $38.15 billion, $39.91 billion and $32.50 billion, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.

 Water heaters use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity, gas, and oil directly. In 1987, 18.4 percent of residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector source electricity (or 1.94 quads) and 30.7 percent of residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector natural gas consumption (or 1.59 quads) were accounted for on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national basis by water heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

tons; and 7,124,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 3.58 percent.

power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reductions are 118,000 tons; 4,890,000 tons; 5,338,000 tons; 5,336,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons; 6,995,000 tons; 7,086,000 tons; and 7,109,000 tons, respectively. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 3.57 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be 7 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.02 percent. For standard levels
2&hyph;8 the reductions are 59 million tons; 2,607 million tons; 2,837 million tons; 2,845 million tons; 3,662 million
tons; 3,747 million tons; and 4,113 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels
is 4.14 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity
generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely
to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 1.6 million
over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;8, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 24.12,
605.97, 654.55, 677.03, 835.53, 842.83 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conclusion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy
efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly,
the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 8 for amended water heater
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 8 will save the most energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(54.45 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department assumes that all electric water heaters will incorporate improved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal characteristics and an integral heat pump, and all gas water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will incorporate improved thermal characteristics and condense the flue gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years for gas water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters exceeds the 14-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases of $437 for gas water heaters, and up to $1,108 for other classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This level also quadruples the first cost of electric and gas water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and drives the short-run manufacturer return on equity from 0.4 percent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative 32.1 percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next two most stringent standard levels, 7 and 6, are projected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
save 45.85 and 44.39 quads of energy, respectively. However, these levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also produce life-cycle cost increases for gas water heaters compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base case with payback of 11.2 and 10.1 years, which are more than two thirds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the average product lifetime. The first cost of electric water heaters at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these levels is quadrupled from the base case and manufacturer short-run 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return on equity is reduced from 0.4 percent to negative 18.1 and negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17.1 percent, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standards level 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 6 for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects these standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 5. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save 34.98 quads of energy. However, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level also produces a life-cycle cost increase for gas water heaters compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the base case, with a payback of 10.1 years, which is more than two thirds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the average product lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for water heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects this standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act_imposed 1990 standard for water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters with standard level 4. The Department concludes that standard level 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for water heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 34.87 quads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 5,336,000 tons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,890,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 2.77 and 2.72 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 2,845 million tons, or as much as 2.93 percent, over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer payback of this standard level is 2.0 and 3.5 years for electric and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas water heaters, respectively. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $1,025 and $31 for electric and gas water heaters, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the standard is expected to double the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's long-run return on equity from 0.4 to 0.8 percent even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the short-run return on equity is projected to drop to negative 3.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as stated previously, the Department believes that the requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat pumps for electric water heaters will cause other manufacturers, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stronger financial characteristics of room air conditioner manufacturers, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be drawn into the mix of manufacturers offering electric water heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. The Department believes that this mix of manufacturers would have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive return on equity compared to that projected for existing water heater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that establishing a standard for electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters that essentially requires the use of heat pumps is a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change for consumers and manufacturers. However, heat pump water heaters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a technology that has to be developed; the product already exists in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace. Additionally, the projected energy savings are very large and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the forecasted benefits appear to outweigh the burdens. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude of some of the changes, such as in first cost and product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing, could make questionable some of the assumptions contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis and may warrant closer scrutiny. For example, as reported in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Support Document, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Model's computation of appliance turnover rate, i.e., the repair or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace decision, is based on industry data about historical annual shipments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and does not explicitly consider the effects of increased first cost. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant increase in first cost could distort this model. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes, however, that water heaters are typically replaced because of tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks which, because of design features such as glass-lined tanks and foamed-in-place insulation, are essentially
non-repairable. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that the impacts on the replacement rate, because of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial increase in first cost, is likely to be small. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welcomes comment on this assumption and other areas where it might be thought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the magnitude of the first cost increase or manufacturing changes might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant additional or revised modeling assumptions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another possible area of concern regarding this proposed standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether heat pump water heaters are physically able to be installed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing space in the replacement market. The heat pump itself will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some additional space, and as was discussed in the product specific comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding classes for water heaters, the Department assumed a sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume would be available to allow air circulation for the proper operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the heat pump. The Department believes that medium and larger sizes of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater installations would typically have sufficient space, being usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed in areas such as basements or garages. For space-restricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications DOE believes that technical solutions, such as heat pumps with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions for ducting air flow, are available as well as integrated space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioning and water heating heat pumps, which are already on the market, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and could be used if and when the central heat pump system is replaced. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very small size installations, such as under-the-counter types, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient space for a heat pump may not be readily available or where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economics of a heat pump may not be justified because the water heating loads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are well below average, the use of electric instantaneous water heaters would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be an effective alternate. A lower limit on the size of electric storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water heaters that the proposed standard would cover may also be a way of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizing the space and low load concerns. The Department believes there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical solutions to require the use of heat pump water heaters wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric storage water heaters are now used and required. This view was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported at the Hot Water Heat Pump Workshop held in Breckenridge, Colorado 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on June 30 through July 2, 1993. The proceedings of the workshop are made a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the record of this notice and are available from the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freedom of Information Reading Room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Other issues that may warrant further DOE analysis include consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance of possible increased noise from heat pump water heaters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated increases in maintenance requirements in comparison to electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance water heaters. DOE is soliciting public comment on these issues, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with additional data or other information that might assist DOE in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better assessing the impacts of this proposed standard on consumers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Because the Department has little information on the space constraints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for replacement water heaters or the frequency with which small water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience low annual water heating loads, the cost-effectiveness analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standard does not explicitly consider these factors. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes the analysis is sufficient but would attempt to expand it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include any information on these or other related factors that becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available during the public comment period. Based on this possible revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, DOE would consider modifying either the proposed standard level for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric water heaters or the definition of the class of water heaters covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the standard. If the analysis warrants, DOE may establish different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes for two or more sizes of electric water heaters. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically invites public comment on this expanded analysis and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives described.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department examined a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of standard levels for direct heating equipment. In reviewing the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel utilization factor, does not include electrical consumption. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, design options such as adding an induced draft fan improve thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiencies with little or no net energy savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards, in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure to determine this energy descriptor is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously mentioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4&hyph;5 presents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five efficiency levels selected for analysis for the 16 classes of direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment. Level 5 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment in today's notice, the Department selected a class of direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced for the representative class. The representative class for direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment is gravity wall heaters greater than 27 kBtu/hr but less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 46 kBtu/hr, which is one of the more prevalent classes of direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 accomplishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by derating the burner by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 percent, level 2 adds electronic ignition, level 3 adds a burner box 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damper, level 4 adds the use of an induced draft fan and electronic ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the baseline unit, and level 5 assumes condensation of the flue gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other classes of direct heating equipment and are found tabulated in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.4 of the Technical Support Document.

Table 4&hyph;6 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the
product. For this representative class, standard level 1 satisfies the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional
price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive
during the first year. Payback for all classes of direct heating equipment may be found in Tables 4.17 to 4.32 of the
Technical Support Document.

3. Significance of Energy Savings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To estimate the base case energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new direct
heating equipment under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard
levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy
Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of
the product:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 -->
Level 1_0.04 Quad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Level 2_0.21 Quad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Level 3_0.38 Quad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The above energy savings are smaller than anticipated because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model predicts fuel switching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from gas to electricity at trial standard levels 4 and above as shown in Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.3 of the Technical Support Document. However, the Department finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased standards at levels 1 through 4 considered above would result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant conservation of energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. The per-unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class is $8.60; to meet levels 2&hyph;5, the manufacturers' cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases are $19.10, $51.80, $157.60, and $227.70, respectively. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are $24.93, $73.60, $171.34, $402.54, and $690.95 for standard levels 1&hyph;5, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 is $10.73 for the representative class; standard level 2 would reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy expenses by $17.32; standard level 3 by $29.53; standard level 4 by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$35.43; and standard level 5 by $48.24. See Technical Support Document, Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all classes of direct heating equipment show that revised standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause a prototypical manufacturer to have slight increases in short-run return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on equity from the 7.4 percent in the base case except for the two most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent levels where short-run return on equity plummets. Standard levels 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 5 are projected to produce short-run return on equity's of 7.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, 7.7 percent, 7.6 percent, 5.2 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised standards have minimal effects on long-run return on equity. Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 7.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, 7.4 percent, 7.3 percent, 7.4 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-cycle cost and net present value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A life-cycle cost is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class, life-cycle costs at standard levels 1 through 3 are less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, a unit meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document, Figure 4.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average consumer of $79.31 for the representative class of direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Standard levels 2 and 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$23.26 and $41.65, respectively. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that standard levels 1 through 3 would not cause any economic burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average consumer. Standard levels 4 and 5 would increase average life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs by $132.40 and $296.32, respectively. See Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 4.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely face in financing the purchase of direct heating equipment. Similarly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that for all classes of direct heating equipment, standard level 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would produce a net present value of $9 million to consumers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;5 are $63 million, $113 million, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative $259 million, and negative $930 million, respectively. See Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In 1987, 6.1 percent of

residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.32 quad) was accounted for on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a national basis by direct heating equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition, decreasing energy use as a result of standards will usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease air pollution. However, in the case of direct heating equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected fuel switching from gas to electric resistance heat causes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy savings to be less than it otherwise would be, and at some of the trial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels the impact on the environment is negative, since it takes more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary energy to heat with resistance electric heat than with a gas furnace.

. Evaluating

standards for electric direct heating equipment might result in standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the use of heat pump technology which would probably resolve this

abnormality, but DOE has not considered adding standards for electric direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment in this proposed rule. The resulting impact on energy use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of fuel switching was considered in The Department's decision-making

over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2, the reductions in oil

Conclusion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards
that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically
feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,
i.e., standard level 5 for amended direct heating equipment standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy per unit but, because of fuel switching from gas to
electric, this level actually causes an energy increase of 0.23 quad between 1996 and 2030. In order to meet this standard,
the Department assumes that all direct heating equipment will be condensing with induced draft and electronic ignition.
This level produces increased life-cycle costs compared to the base case for all classes of product and has payback
which exceed the average product life for all but two classes. Additionally, this level reduces manufacturer short-run
return on equity from 7.4 percent in the base case to 0.9 percent and has a negative net present value of $1.1 billion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 for direct heating equipment outweigh the
benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level, level 4, is projected to have energy savings of 0.23 quad, but the savings here
are also reduced by fuel switching. This level also produces life-cycle cost increases, compared to the base case,
of $132 for the representative class, with similar increases for most classes. The payback at this level is 15.0 years
for the representative class, equaling the average product life, with similar payback for most of the other classes.
Additionally this level has a negative impact on the environment by increasing two of the three atmospheric emissions
studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 for direct heating equipment outweigh the
benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act_imposed 1990 standard for direct heating equipment with standard level 3. The Department concludes that standard
level 3 for direct heating equipment saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically
justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be a significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these
savings are calculated to be 0.38 quad of primary energy and are essentially not affected by fuel switching. The standard
could have a slight positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by more than 37,000 tons and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by almost 32,000 tons by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard is projected to reduce emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 26 million tons over the forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology that is necessary to meet this standard: derated burners, electronic ignition, and burner box dampers
or induced draft, is presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer
payback of this standard level is 7.5 years, approximately one-half of the average product life. This standard is
expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $42. Additionally, the standard is expected
to have little or no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 7.4 percent and has a net present
value of $328 million. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects
that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department examined a range of standard levels for mobile home furnaces. In reviewing the design options necessary
to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined that a new energy descriptor was needed to adequately
address some of the design options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, annual fuel utilization
factor, does not include electrical consumption. For example, to consider improvements in fan motor efficiency,
the savings in electrical consumption would have to be accounted for in the descriptor. Furthermore, other design
options (for instance, fan-assisted combustion) improve thermal efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall
electrical consumption which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher annual fuel utilization
factors with little or no net energy savings. Lastly, since annual fuel utilization factor is defined in the Act in
terms of an isolated combustion system, there are steps that could be taken to obtain a higher annual fuel utilization
factor, such as adding jacket insulation, which would have no impact on the efficiency of a furnace installed indoors.
Since practically all mobile home furnaces are installed indoors, the current descriptor is not entirely appropriate
for this rulemaking. Because of the above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing the standards,
in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The test procedure to determine this energy descriptor is
contained in the previously mentioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4&hyph;7 presents the six efficiency
levels selected for analysis for the two classes of mobile home furnaces. Level 6 corresponds to the highest efficiency
level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of mobile home furnaces in today's notice, the Department selected
a class of mobile home furnaces as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is presenting the results
only for that class. The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections
as those referenced for the representative class. The representative class for mobile home furnaces is gas fired
mobile home furnaces, which is the most prevalent class of mobile home furnaces. For this representative class, trial
standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by the use of improved fan motor
efficiency, level 2 adds a burner box damper, level 3 adds an improved heat exchanger, level 4 substitutes fan-assisted
combustion and electronic ignition for the burner box damper and improved heat exchanger, level 5 assumes condensing
of the flue gases and level 6 adds continuous furnace modulation. Similar design options are used to achieve the above
efficiencies for oil-fired mobile home furnaces and are found tabulated in Section 1.5 of the Technical Support Document.

product. For this representative class, standard levels 1 and 2 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the
additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer
will receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of mobile home furnaces may be found in Tables 4.3 and 4.4

3. Significance of Energy Savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To estimate the energy savings by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home furnaces under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result for all classes of the product: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The above energy savings are smaller than anticipated because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model predicts fuel switching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from gas to electricity at trial standard levels 2 and above as shown in Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.4 of the Technical Support Document. However, the Department finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the increased standards levels considered above except for level 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the max tech level, would result in a significant conservation of energy.

 The Department is refraining from publishing the per-unit increased cost to

manufacturers to meet the trial standard levels for mobile home furnaces due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to confidentiality considerations. The Department has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data provided is confidential pursuant to 10 CFR 1004.11. There are only two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of this product, and they would provide data only if DOE agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to publish the data. Today's proposed rule is based upon the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of these data, and others, e.g., data from component suppliers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in Section 1.5 of the Technical Support Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the considered levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5.74 for level 1 and $76.80, $186.35, $273.71, $569.32, and $1151.56 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels 2&hyph;6, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 is $9.56 for the representative class; standard level 2 would reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy expenses by $25.71; standard level 3 by $35.54; standard level 4 by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$44.96; standard level 5 by $83.20; and standard level 6 by $100.15. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all classes of mobile home furnaces show that revised standards would cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypical manufacturer to have some fluctuations in short-run return on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity from the 7.3 percent return in the base case, especially at the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most stringent levels. Standard levels 1 through 6 are projected to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-run return on equity's of 7.2 percent, 7.3 percent, 6.8 percent, 7.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, 3.3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. However, revised standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have little or minimal effect on the prototypical manufacturer's long-run 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 6 are projected to produce long- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run return on equity's of 7.3 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.2 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.1 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Life-cycle cost and net present value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A life-cycle cost is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the six candidate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels, a unit meeting level 5 has the lowest consumer life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost. See Technical Support Document, Figure 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average affected consumer of $100.83 for the representative class of mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home furnace; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$210.08; standard level 3, by $210.16; standard level 4, by $227.91; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 5, by $358.96. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no standard level, other than max tech, would cause any economic burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average consumer. At standard level 6, the average life-cycle costs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected to increase by $34.33, compared to the base case. See Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support Document, Table 4.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely face in financing the purchase of mobile home furnaces. Similarly, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that for all classes of mobile home furnaces, standard level 1 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a net present value of $12 million to consumers. The corresponding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0net present values for standard levels 2&hyph;6 are all negative at $175 million, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$839 million, $1.39 billion, $2.86 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively.

mobile home furnaces.

 The determination of this

factor must be made by the Attorney General.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

F. Need to save energy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1987, 1.9 percent of residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector natural gas consumption (or 0.1 quad) was accounted for on a national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis by mobile home furnaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, decreasing energy use as a result of standards will usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease air pollution. However, in the case of mobile home furnaces, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected fuel switching from gas to electric resistance heat causes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy savings to be less than it otherwise would be, and at most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher trial standard levels the impact on the environment is negative, since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it takes more primary energy to heat with resistance electric heat than with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas furnace. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluating standards for electric mobile home furnaces might result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards requiring the use of heat pump technology which would probably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve this abnormality, but DOE has not considered adding standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric mobile home furnaces in this proposed rule. The resulting impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy use because of fuel switching was considered in The Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision-making as discussed in the conclusion below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) at level 1. For all classes of mobile home furnaces at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 2&hyph;6, SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are projected to increase by 5,000 tons; 29,000 tons; 54,000 tons; 122,000 tons; and 270,000 tons, respectively.
The highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.18 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards at levels 1 and 2 would result in a decrease in nitrogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dioxide (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be over 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
level 2, the total estimated NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be less than 1,000 tons. For standard levels 3&hyph;6, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are projected to increase by 7,000 tons; 16,000 tons; 34,000 tons; and 87,000 tons, respectively. The highest
peak annual increase of these levels is 0.05 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions at levels 1 and 2. For either of these levels, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be approximately 1 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard
levels 3&hyph;6, CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are increased by 2 million tons; 8 million tons; 15 million tons; and 49 million tons, respectively. The
highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.05 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 0.75 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. Standard levels 2&hyph;6, are estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in an increase in oil imports of 2.87, 18.14, 35.16, 77.82 and 174.02 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million barrels, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy
efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly,
the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 6 for amended mobile home furnace
standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 6 will save the most energy per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit but, because of fuel switching from gas to electric, this level has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative overall energy savings (^0.02 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all mobile home furnaces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be condensing furnaces with full modulation. At nearly triple the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase price to consumers, this level produces negative life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings compared to the base case of $154 and has a payback of 13.0 years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is more than half of the average product lifetime. The level also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity by over 70 percent and has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative net present value of $8.9 billion, as well as increasing all three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental atmospheric emissions studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for mobile home furnaces outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 5. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save the most energy of any of the mobile home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnace trial standard levels, 0.11 quad, but the savings here are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced by fuel switching. This level produces the highest life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings compared to the base case of $239 and has a payback of 7.6 years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is slightly more than one third of the average product lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the level reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity by over 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent and has a negative net present value of $4.6 billion, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing all three atmospheric emissions studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for mobile home furnaces outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three next most stringent standard levels, 4, 3, and 2, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected to have energy savings ranging from .03 to .05 quad, but the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
here are also reduced by fuel switching. These levels also produce life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost savings compared to the base case ranging from $108 to $210 with payback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranging from 7.5 to 3.0 years and have little or no impact on manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return on equity. However, these levels all have negative net present values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranging from negative $1.39 billion to negative $.175 billion, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing one or more of the three atmospheric emissions studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4, 3 and 2 for mobile home furnaces outweigh their benefits, and rejects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home furnaces with standard level 1 for mobile home furnaces. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that standard level 1 for mobile home furnaces saves a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be small but significant energy savings at this level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.02 quad of primary energy and are essentially not affected by fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switching. In addition, the standard could have a slight positive effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by as much as 1,000 tons each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 1 million tons over the forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology that is necessary to meet this standard, improved fan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor efficiency, is presently available. The Department finds the level to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 0.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of approximately $102. Additionally, the standard is expected to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;essentially no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.3 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the two competitors.

The Department examined a range of standard levels for kitchen ranges and ovens. Table 4&hyph;9 presents the five
efficiency levels that had been selected for analysis for the eight classes of kitchen ranges and ovens. Level 5 corresponds
to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.

For analytical purposes the Department segmented the above classes into three groups: Conventional ovens, conventional
cooking tops and microwave ovens. Rather than presenting the results for all classes of ranges and ovens in today's
notice, the Department selected a class or classes of ranges and ovens as being representative, or typical, of each
group of the product, and is presenting the results only for those classes. The results for the other classes can be
found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The
results and conclusions for each group are presented separately below.

Efficiency levels analyzed for conventional ovens.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department selected two classes of conventional ovens, non-self-cleaning electric ovens and non-self-cleaning
gas ovens, as being representative of conventional ovens. For non-self-cleaning electric ovens, trial standard
level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by improved door seals, reduced venting,
reflective surfaces and by not having an oven door window; level 2 increases insulation; levels 3 and 4 add convection
and reduced thermal mass, and level 5 adds improved insulation, reduced conduction losses, and an oven separator
and is a biradiant oven. For non-self-cleaning gas ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency
improvement from the baseline by incorporating an electric ignition and by not having an oven door window; level 2
adds improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces and increased insulation; levels 3 and 4 add convection,
reduced thermal mass and improved insulation, and level 5 adds an oven separator and reduced conduction losses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department selected two classes of conventional cooking tops, electric-coil cooking tops and gas cooking tops,
as being representative of conventional cooking tops. For electric-coil cooking tops, trial standard level 1 remains
at the baseline while level 2 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by improved heating
element contact, level 3 adds reflective surfaces, and levels 4 and 5 for this class are the same as level 3. For gas cooking
tops, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by having reduced burner
excess air, level 2 adds electronic ignition, level 3 adds sealed burners and reflective surfaces, and levels 4 and
5 for this class are the same as level 3.

Efficiency levels analyzed for microwave ovens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department considers microwave ovens to comprise one class. For microwave ovens, trial standard level 1 accomplishes
the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating a more efficient power supply, level 2 assumes
a more efficient fan, in level 3 the wave guide is modified, level 4 assumes an improved magnetron, and level 5 adds reflective
surfaces.

i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that
the consumer will receive during the first year.

To estimate

the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of new conventional ovens under the base case is compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the

A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conventional ovens. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas non-self-cleaning
ovens is $5.92; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $14.40, levels 3 and 4 are $29.75, and level 5 is
$61.64. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric non-self-cleaning
ovens is $4.21; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $8.45, levels 3 and 4 are $19.11, and level 5 is $100.12.
See Technical Support Document, Tables 1.9 and 1.11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for gas non- self-cleaning ovens at level 1 is $13.84; to
meet level 2, the cost increase is $36.56, levels 3 and 4 are $69.00, and level 5 is $161.09. For electric non-self-cleaning
ovens the cost at level 1 is $8.84; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $18.73, levels 3 and 4 are $41.30, and level 5 is
$213.80. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $8.38 for gas non-self-cleaning
ovens; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $13.32; standard levels 3 and 4 by $14.82; and standard level
5 by $15.35. For electric non-self-cleaning ovens level 1 would reduce energy expenses by $4.22; standard level 2
by $6.07; levels 3 and 4 by $9.45; and level 5 by $14.63. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for all classes of conventional ovens show
that revised standards would have little or no effect on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity
from the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.5 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively. Revised standards have similar
effects on long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's
of 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.6 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document,
Tables 5.1 and 5.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available
because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical
firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent
firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange
Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for gas cooking tops is $0.78; to meet level
2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $15.57, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $41.71. The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers
to meet the level 1 efficiency for electric-coil cooking tops is zero, since for this class level 1 is the same as the
baseline; to meet level 2, the manufacturers' cost increase is $2.28, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $5.31. See Technical
Support Document, Tables 1.4 and 1.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increase for gas cooking tops at level 1 is $1.63; to meet level 2,
the cost increase is $113.38 and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $168.08. For electric-coil cooking tops, the cost at level 1 is
unchanged, since it is at the baseline; to meet level 2, the cost increase is $4.79, and levels 3, 4 and 5 are $11.24. See
Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $0.95 for gas cooking tops; standard
level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $16.09 and standard levels 3, 4 and 5 by $16.68. For electric-coil cooking tops,
level 1 would not reduce energy expenses since it is at the baseline; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses
by $0.93 and levels 3, 4 and 5 by $1.15. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.3.

The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for all classes of conventional cooking tops
show that revised standards would have slight impacts on a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity
from the 8.6 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce short-run returns on equity
of 8.6 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.6 percent, 8.7 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. Revised standards have similar
effects on long-run return on equity, with some increases at the higher standard levels. Standard levels 1 through
5 are projected to produce long-run returns on equity of 8.6 percent, 8.2 percent, 8.8 percent, 9.5 percent and 10.0

A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the representative classes,
life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 5, the max tech level, for electric non-self-cleaning ovens,
are less than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 3 or 4 have the lowest consumer
life-cycle cost for electric non-self-cleaning ovens whereas for gas non-self-cleaning ovens, the lowest life-cycle
cost occurred for a unit meeting level 2. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.4 and 4.6.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average affected consumer of $73.09 for the representative class of gas non-self-cleaning ovens; standard level
2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$42.07; standard levels 3 and 4, by $26.37; while standard level 5 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in an increase of $59.83. For the representative class of electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-self-cleaning ovens, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs for the average consumer of $27.29; standard level 2 would reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average life-cycle costs by $38.05; standard levels 3 and 4, by $53.25; while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 5 would result in an increase of $61.41. The life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions indicate that no standard level, other than max tech, would cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tables 4.12 and 4.14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely face in financing the purchase of ovens. Similarly, DOE did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that for all classes of conventional ovens, standard level 1 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a net present value of $1.20 billion to consumers. The corresponding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net present values for levels 2&hyph;5 are $0.52 billion, $1.09 billion, $1.12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline

unit. However, it should be noted that for another class, electric smooth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element cooking tops, there are life-cycle cost increases for units meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 4 and 5. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 2

Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in

reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because

virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 12.74 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in oil imports are estimated to be 21.33, 32.68, 51.88, and 63.07 million

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conventional ovens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 5 for amended conventional oven standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.88 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that all conventional ovens will not have an oven door window and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased and improved insulation, convection and an oven separator, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced thermal mass and conduction losses. Additionally, electric ovens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be biradiant, and gas ovens would incorporate an electronic ignition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years and 15.7 years for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the gas and electric representative classes is roughly equal to the 19-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product life and ranges up to 55 years for other classes. At this standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level, all classes have increased life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for conventional ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for conventional ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 4 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.69 quads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 287,000 tons and 239,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.15 and 0.12 percent, respectively, by the year 2030.
Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 187 million tons, or 0.20 percent, over the forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer payback of this standard level is 7.5 years and 4.9 years for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative gas and electric classes, respectively, with a payback no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than 10.4 years, or roughly half of the 19-year product life, for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost for the electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of approximately $53 for that class. Life-cycle cost savings are $26 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the gas representative class and are positive for all other classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the standard is expected to have almost no impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

Conventional cooking tops.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., standard level 5 for amended conventional cooking top standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.04 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that all representative classes of conventional cooking tops will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflective surfaces. Additionally, electric-coil cooking tops would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved element contact, and gas cooking tops would incorporate reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burner excess air, electronic ignition and sealed burners. It should also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted that the design options for the representative classes are the same for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 5, 4 and 3,_i.e., max tech,_ with the differences in those levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having to do with design options for electric smooth element cooking tops. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 5, the max tech level for all classes, electric smooth element cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tops require the use of induction elements. However, the payback at this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level for electric smooth element cooking tops is 193 years, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$550 increase in life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for conventional cooking tops outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 4. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save 2.85 quads of energy. As discussed above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the representative classes are still at their max tech level, while electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smooth element cooking tops require the use of halogen elements. The payback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this standard level for electric smooth element cooking tops is 890 years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a $343 increase in life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for conventional cooking tops outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save 2.68 quads of energy. As discussed above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the representative classes are still at their max tech level, while electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smooth element cooking tops are at the baseline. The payback at this standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level for the representative gas and electric classes are 10.1 and 9.8 years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, which slightly exceeds half of the product life. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department is concerned about the longevity of the design option, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflective surfaces, required to meet this standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the questionable technology and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic burdens of standard level 3 for conventional cooking tops outweigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional cooking top portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 2 for conventional cooking tops. The Department concludes that standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 2 for conventional cooking tops saves a significant amount of energy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is technologically feasible and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.54 quads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 151,000 tons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.09 and 0.02 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 144 million tons, or 0.15 percent, over the forecast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer payback of this standard level is 7.0 years and 5.2 years for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative gas and electric classes, respectively, or roughly one-third of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 19-year product life. This standard lowers the life-cycle cost for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative gas and electric classes by $66 and $6, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the standard is expected to have only a slight reduction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microwave ovens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 5 for amended microwave oven standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(0.84 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department assumes that all microwave ovens will have more efficient power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies, fans and magnetrons; modified wave guides and reflective surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the payback at this standard level of 13.0 years exceeds the 10-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product life, and this level produces increased life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for microwave ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 4. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save 0.77 quad of energy. However, the payback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this standard level of 7.4 years is nearly three quarters of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life and produces an increase in life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for microwave ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microwave oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 3 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microwave ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 3 for microwave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.67 quad of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 128,000 tons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
156,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.10 percent each by the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 56 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons, or 0.10 percent, over the forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer payback of this standard level is 2.9 years, which meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebuttable presumption test of economic justification. This standard is close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the lowest life-cycle cost for microwave ovens and is expected to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $14. Additionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard is expected to have almost no impact on the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this standard does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department examined a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of standard levels for pool heaters. In reviewing the design options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, Thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficiency, does not include pilot light usage or electrical consumption. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, to consider electronic ignition, the savings in pilot light gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption would have to be accounted for in the descriptor. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other design options, for instance, fan-assisted combustion, improve thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thermal Efficiency with little or no net energy savings. Because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing the standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The test procedure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine this energy descriptor is contained in the previously mentioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4&hyph;13 presents the four efficiency levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that had been selected for analysis for pool heaters. Level 4 corresponds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.

For gas-fired pool heaters, trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above

efficiency improvement from the baseline by incorporating an electronic

ignition, level 2 assumes heat exchanger efficiency at the noncondensing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To estimate the energy savings by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could result for each:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The per-unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $39.39; to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet levels 2&hyph;4, the manufacturers' incremental cost increases are $95.05, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$405.68, and $760.68, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are $87.13, $213.97, $1,025.41, and $1,839.60 for standard levels 1&hyph;4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 is $32.77; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $42.51; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 3 by $59.53; and standard level 4 by $68.16. See Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool heaters show that revised standards would result in increases in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 17.9 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce short- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run return on equity's of 18.0 percent, 18.4 percent, 19.7 percent and 19.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, respectively. Revised standards have even greater increases in long- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-run return on equity's of 18.7 percent, 20.1 percent, 26.0 percent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-cycle cost and net present value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A life-cycle cost is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 3 and level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the four candidate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels, a unit meeting level 1 has the lowest consumer life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average affected consumer of $231.13 and standard level 2 would reduce average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life-cycle costs by $198.94. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard levels 1 and 2 would not cause any economic burden on the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer. Standard level 3 would increase average life-cycle costs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$447.19, and standard level 4 would increase average life-cycle costs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1,177.57. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing the purchase of pool heaters. Similarly, DOE did not consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national average energy prices were appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;4 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$0.13 billion, negative $1.09 billion, and negative $2.44 billion, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.

In 1987, 0.8 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.04 quad) was accounted for on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a national basis by pool heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume A.

 Decreases in air pollution will occur for nitrogen dioxide (NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

levels 2&hyph;4 the reductions are 12,000 tons; 31,000 tons and 41,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual
reduction of these levels is 0.03 percent.

Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon

dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total estimated CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
reduction would be 4 million tons. During this time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the peak annual reduction of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
emissions that are expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 2&hyph;4 the reductions are 12 million tons; 32 million tons and 43 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.04 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for pool heaters, standard levels 1&hyph;4, are not expected to affect oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conclusion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 4 for amended pool heater standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 4 will save the most energy (0.78 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that all pool heaters will be condensing pulse combustion pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters. However, the payback at this standard level of 27.0 years exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 15-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1,178. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level is projected to save 0.58 quads of energy. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payback at this standard level of 17.2 years also exceeds the product's life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and produces an increase in life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters with standard level 2 for pool heaters. The Department concludes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 2 for pool heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologically feasible and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period 1996_2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.23 quads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by as much as 12,000 tons, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.01 percent by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by 12 million tons, or 0.02 percent, over the forecast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer payback of this standard level is 5.0 years or one-third of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product life. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle cost of approximately $199. Additionally, the standard is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity from 17.9 percent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the base case to 18.4 percent in the short run and to 20.1 percent in the long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitors.

Rather than presenting the results for all classes of fluorescent lamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballasts in today's notice, the Department selected a class of fluorescent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lamp ballasts as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced for the representative class. The representative class for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluorescent lamp ballasts is ballasts for two F40 lamps, which is the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevalent class. For this representative class, trial standard level 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by assuming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy-efficient magnetic ballasts with a heater cutout; levels 2 and 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correspond to efficiencies achieved by rapid start electronic ballasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other classes, except that for the F&hyph;32 classes level 3 corresponds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies achieved by instant start electronic ballasts.

To estimate the base case energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new fluorescent
lamp ballasts under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard
levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, Commercial Energy End-Use Model projects over the period
1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings could result

A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The per-unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class is $2.00; to meet levels 2 and 3, the manufacturers' cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase is $7.00. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are $4.91 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and $8.95 for standard levels 1 and 2/3, respectively. See Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document, Table 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 is $1.11 for the representative class; standard levels 2 and 3 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce energy expenses by $3.62. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.12a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluorescent lamp ballasts show that revised standards would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases in a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15.5 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce short-run return on equity's of 23.7 percent, 24.5 percent and 24.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, respectively. Revised standards are projected to slightly increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce long-run return on equity's of 16.0 percent, 16.1 percent and 16.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-cycle cost and net present value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A life-cycle cost is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the baseline unit. Of the three candidate standard levels, a unit meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 2 or 3 had the lowest consumer life-cycle costs. See Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document, Table 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average consumer of $7.48 for the representative class, and standard levels 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $30.23. These life-cycle cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the average consumer. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.12d. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (2, 4, and 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing the purchase of fluorescent lamp ballasts. Similarly, DOE did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that national average energy prices were appropriate.

The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,

indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $22.3

are $25.4 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively. See Technical Support

Need of the Nation to save energy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fluorescent lamp ballasts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use electricity directly. In 1987, 27 percent of commercial sector source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity (or 2.17 quads) was accounted for on a national basis by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluorescent lamp ballasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume A.

 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed

ballasts at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated

SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total

estimated NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

peak annual reduction of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plants in the United States is 1.19 percent. For standard levels 2 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3, the reductions are 2,566,000 tons and 2,739,000 tons, respectively. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.47 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total estimated CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be 1,174 million tons. During this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time period, the peak annual reduction of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be emitted by power plants in the United States are 1.17 percent. For standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 1,358 million tons and 1,450 million tons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 1.44 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 230.41 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 266.97 and 285.05 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrels, respectively.

5. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 3 for amended fluorescent lamp ballast standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (17.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that all fluorescent lamp ballasts will be electronic rapid or instant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Appliance Energy Conservation Act&hyph;1988 imposed 1990 standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluorescent lamp ballasts with standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concludes that standard level 3 for fluorescent lamp ballasts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2025, these savings
are calculated to be 17.0 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment
by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 2,739,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 1.47 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore,
the standard will reduce emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 1,450 million tons, or 1.44 percent, over the forecast period. The technologies that are necessary to meet this
standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback
of this standard level is 2.4 years for the representative class and no more than 5.3 years for any class. This standard
has the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately
$30 for the representative class. Additionally, the standard is expected to increase both the short- and long-run
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 15.5 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial
redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

The Department examined a range of standard levels for color television sets. Table 4&hyph;17 presents the efficiency
levels that have been selected for analysis. Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered
in the engineering analysis. For level 3, the annual energy use in kWh per year can be expressed as E=20.5+6.1D, where
D equals the screen size in inches.

The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation
of energy.

4. Economic Justification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $2.15; to meet levels 2 and 3 the manufacturers'
cost increases are $3.65 and $10.25, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.4. At those levels of
efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases are $3.76, $6.39 and $19.37 for standard levels 1
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
3, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy
expense) at level 1 is $1.81, standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.95 and standard level 3 by $5.71. See
Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for
television sets show that the prototypical manufacturer has a negative return on equity of 1.9 percent in the absence
of standards and that standards cause slight but further reductions in both short- and long-run return on equity.
Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to produce negative short-run return on equitys of 2.0 percent, 2.0 percent
and 3.3 percent, respectively. Long-run return on equitys are projected to be negative 1.9 percent, 2.0 percent and
2.2 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Most financial data of the type needed
to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries
or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial
characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent
firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company
annual reports.

B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Life-cycle cost and net present value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For color television sets,
life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline unit. Of the three candidate standard levels, a
unit meeting level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate
standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers
who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being
considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies
of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function
of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only
for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the
average consumer of $10.97, standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $14.52, and standard level
3 by $24.06. The lower life-cycle costs indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on the average
consumer. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally
found little impact, the Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range
of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of television sets. Similarly,
DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since
any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that standard level 1 would produce
a net present value of $0.64 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2 and 3 are $1.35
billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Energy savings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of electricity consumption for television sets.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lessening of utility or performance of products.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen
the existing utility or performance of television sets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Impact of lessening of competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need of the nation to save energy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Television sets use electricity directly. In 1987, 2.1 percent of residential sector source electricity (or 0.22
quads) was accounted for on a national basis by television sets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical
Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

). For television sets at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

2 and 3, the reductions are 261,000 tons and 599,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these
levels is 0.29 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction would be 43 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.07 percent. For standard levels

of these levels is 0.29 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity
generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely
to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 8.86 million
barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 22.05
and 53.88, respectively.

5. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards
that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically
feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency,
i.e., standard level 3 for amended television set standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the standard levels analyzed, level 3 will save the most energy (3.13 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet
this standard, the Department assumes that all television sets will have reduced standby power and reduced white/black
screen power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is establishing a standard for television sets. The Department
concludes that standard level 3 for television sets saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible
and economically justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings
are calculated to be 3.13 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment
by reducing the emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 528,000 tons and 599,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.29 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the
standard will reduce emissions of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 263 million tons, or 0.29 percent, over the forecast period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently available. The Department finds the level
to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 3.5 years, which compares favorably
with the 12-year product life. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost and is expected to result in a reduction
in life-cycle cost of approximately $24. Additionally, the standard is expected to have only a slight reduction in
the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of negative 1.9 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial
redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.

a. Environmental Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department prepared an Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0819) on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and the implementing regulations of the Council on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508). The Environmental Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addresses the possible incremental environmental effects attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the proposed standards to the design of the eight types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered products: Room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact was issued December 1992 and is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Publishing the finding has been delayed along with the proposed rulemaking due to difficulties in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolving issues and coordinating with a related rulemaking. The Finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No Significant Impact concludes that the proposed standards would result in no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant environmental impacts and that an environmental impact statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Environmental Assessment is published within the Technical Support

b. Regulatory Impact Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) directs that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing a significant regulatory action,
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 an agency perform a regulatory analysis. Such an analysis presents major alternatives to the regulation that could
achieve substantially the same regulatory goal at lower cost, as well as a description of the costs and benefits (including
potential net benefits) of the proposed rule.

``Significant regulatory action'' means any regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of
the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise intefere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action.'' Accordingly, the draft regulatory action has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget has reviewed the draft regulatory action under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory review of the draft regulatory action is summarized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. This summary focuses on the major alternatives considered in arriving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the proposed approach to improving the energy efficiency of consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The reader is referred to the complete draft ``Regulatory Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis,'' which is contained in the Technical Support Document, available as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated at the beginning of this notice. It consists of: (1) A statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the problem addressed by this regulation, and the mandate for government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action; (2) a description and analysis of the feasible policy alternatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation; (3) a quantitative comparison of the impacts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives; and (4) the economic impact of the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted at the outset that none of the alternatives that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined for these eight products saved as much energy as the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, most of the alternatives would require that enabling legislation be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted, since authority to carry out those alternatives does not presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist.

Alternatives for Achieving Consumer Product Energy Conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Six major alternatives were identified by DOE as representing feasible policy alternatives for achieving consumer

alternatives include:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each alternative has been evaluated in terms of its ability to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant energy savings at reasonable costs, and has been compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no new regulatory action were taken, then no new standards would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented for these eight products. This is essentially the ``base case'' for each appliance. In this case, between
the years 1996 and 2030 there would be expected energy use of 443.6 quads of primary energy, with no energy savings and
a zero net present value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several alternatives to the base case can be grouped under the heading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of informational action. They include consumer product labeling and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's public education and information program. Both of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives are mandated by the Act. One base case alternative would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the energy conservation potential of enhancing these programs. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model this possibility, the Department assumed that market discount rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be lowered by 5 percent for purchasers of these eight products. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in energy savings equal to 1.7 quads, with expected consumption equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 441.8 quads. The net present value is estimated to be $2.7 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another method of setting standards would entail requiring that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design options be used on each product, i.e., prescriptive standards. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these eight products, prescriptive standards are assumed to be implemented as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards at one level below the performance standards. The lower standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level entails slightly smaller expenditures for tooling and purchased parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the economic impacts that are expected before the implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date should be slightly smaller for prescriptive standards. This resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy consumption, between 1996 and 2030, of 389.2 quads, and savings of 54.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quads. The net present value, in 1990 dollars, was $92.3 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various financial incentive alternatives were tested. These included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax credits and rebates to consumers, as well as tax credits to manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tax credits to consumers were assumed to be 15 percent of the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense for higher energy efficiency features of these appliances, while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebates were assumed to be 15 percent of the increase in equipment prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tax credits to consumers showed a change from the base case, saving 3.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quads with a net present value of $6.0 billion. Consumer rebates showed more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizable changes; they would save 4.5 quads with a net present value of $8.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another financial incentive that was considered was tax credits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers for the production of energy-efficient models of these eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appliances. In this scenario, an investment tax credit of 20 percent was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed. The tax credits to manufacturers had almost no effect; the energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption estimates are 442.8 quads with savings equal to 0.7 quad, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net present value equal to $0.8 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of this scenario is so small because the investment tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit was applicable only to the tooling and machinery costs of the firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firms' fixed costs and most of the design improvements that would likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be adopted to manufacture more efficient versions of these products would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve purchased parts. Expenses for purchased parts would not be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an investment tax credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two scenarios of voluntary energy efficiency targets were examined. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first one, the proposed energy conservation standards were assumed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily adopted by all the relevant manufacturers in 5 years. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second scenario, the proposed standards were assumed to be adopted in 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. In these scenarios, the 5-year delay would result in energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption by these appliances of 388.0 quads, energy savings of 55.2 quads, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a net present value of $97.1 billion; the 10-year delay would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
398.4 quads of energy being consumed, 44.8 quads being saved, and a net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present value of $76.6 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These scenarios assume that there would be universal voluntary adoption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the energy conservation standards by these appliance manufacturers, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption for which there is no reasonable assurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Lastly, all of these alternatives must be gauged against the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that are being proposed in this notice. Such performance standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in energy consumption of the eight appliances to total an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 379.4 quads of primary energy over the 1996&hyph;2030 time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Savings would be 64.1 quads, and the net present value would be an expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$108.7 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As noted at the beginning of this section, none of the alternatives that

were considered for these products would save as much energy as the proposed

rule.

c. ``Takings'' Assessment Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing a regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is intended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings and help such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies account for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the Order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements or limitations on private property use, or that require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dedications or exactions from owners of private property.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are three parts of the appliance standards program that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conceivably could be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' These are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and certification requirements, the impacts of standard levels, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible DOE testing of products for validation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the first part, namely, testing and certification, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that such a requirement, implementing a long-established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory mandate in a manner calculated to minimize adverse economic impacts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not constitute a ``taking'' of private property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the Department's possible validation testing does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute a ``taking'' within limitations described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the impact of standards could be viewed by some as a ``taking.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Department believes that while an energy conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard may limit some manufacturers in the range of appliance efficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they can produce, such narrowing of the energy efficiency range does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute a ``taking'' in the sense described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, in none of the three parts of the appliance standards program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does the Department believe that the provisions of Executive Order 12630 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertain.

d. Federalism Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds that today's proposed rule, if finalized, will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a substantial direct effect on State governments. State regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have existed on these eight products were preempted by the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards established in the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could petition the Department for exemption from such preemption, and none has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done so. Today's Final Rule has no added effect on States. Thus, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the foregoing, the Department finds that the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment for this rulemaking is not warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides for subsequent State petitions for exemption from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preemption, which necessarily means that the determination as to whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteria set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the Act. When DOE receives such a petition, it will be appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with the criteria in

the Act.

e. Regulatory Flexibility Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of the impact of regulations on small businesses. Small businesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are defined as those firms within an industry that are privately owned and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less dominant in the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rulemaking, eight different products and, hence, industries are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being addressed. Regulatory flexibility issues will be discussed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries for which standards are being prescribed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the energy conservation standard on those room air conditioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers who could be considered small businesses will be discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The room air conditioner industry is characterized by three firms with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large market shares (accounting for nearly 75 percent of sales) and numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms sharing the remaining one-quarter of the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are significant differences among the major firms. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, the Department has learned that average cost has an inverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship to firm size. Thus, the industry has economies of scale, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large firms (to the extent that their facilities are up-to-date) have lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average costs than small firms. This fact, coupled with increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitiveness of the national market, probably accounts for the continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation that has been occurring for several decades. The fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation has been producing larger firms strongly corroborates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding that large firms have a cost advantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A principal implication of consolidation is that the smaller of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms will be, on average, in more danger of failing or being bought out than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will the large firms. Because of the greater precariousness of smaller firms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any decrease in average profitability is more likely to mean the difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between success and failure for a smaller firm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the point of view of competitiveness, a decrease in average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profitability could speed up the process of consolidation, producing a less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitive industry, while an increase in average profitability could help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain the current levels of competition. Either effect might well be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary, because, in the long run, the number of firms should be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the industry's cost structure and by the way a single firm's elasticity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand relates to the number of competing firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some small firms have more energy efficient models than larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms, and while some have more models of average efficiency, the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher efficiency standards on small firms is likely to be mixed. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are technologically difficult to meet, however, they may hurt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected smaller firms the most, because smaller firms have less sophisticated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research and development capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, the impact of the energy conservation standards on water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater manufacturers needs to be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water heater manufacturing firms can be divided into two groups: those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that compete on large sales volume products and those that compete in small, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized markets. Small firms are generally forced to specialize in small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market niches that offer some protection from the cost advantage that large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms hold when they can produce in volume. This effect can even be observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the major producers, in the tendency of the smaller major producers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce somewhat more specialized products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Just like the room air conditioner industry, water heater manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is characterized by economies of scale in production, and large firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally tend to have average costs that are lower than those of small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although larger firms have a cost advantage because of economies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scale, the very small firms in the water heater manufacturing industry have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found market niches in which to survive profitably. There are at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small firms which manufacture standard electric resistance water heaters. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, there are also two small firms that manufacture heat pump water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters. Therefore, if a very stringent efficiency standard for water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is mandated, one could expect that given the small margins in the industry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some small firms may have to leave the market. On the other hand, the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms that specialize in higher efficiency models (such as heat pump water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heaters) may experience a boom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The small firms that sell niche products such as heat pump water heaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually find that these markets have higher margins. As a result, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible that small firms would have an easier time passing through increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variable costs that result from standards, and thus may be more positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected than large firms by standards. However, this prediction should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tempered by the observation that if standards are technologically difficult to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet, they may hurt selected smaller firms the most since, as noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller firms typically have less sophisticated research and development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirdly, the direct heating equipment industry must be considered. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, too, is characterized by economies of scale in production, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger firms having average costs that are lower than those of smaller firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Here, too, there has been continuing consolidation over the past several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same points raised above about the implications of consolidation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitiveness among water heater firms pertain to manufacturers of direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, the mobile home furnace industry will be addressed. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, two firms supply all the gas-fired mobile home furnaces. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions with industry sources revealed that the market shares of the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms are approximately 50 percent each, the Department believes that neither 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a small firm on which standards could have a significant adverse impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The characterization of the kitchen ranges and oven industry (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microwave ovens) is similar to those industries previously discussed. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, too, displays economies of scale in production and increasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation as the larger firms have been acquiring smaller ones for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
past few decades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since many, if not most, of the energy conservation standards can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved without significant retooling of plant and equipment, it is probable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such standards will not have significant adverse impacts on the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pool heater industry, too, is characterized by economies of scale in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, with the consequent price advantage that large firms have over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller ones. This industry, though, is already highly concentrated, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparently never had a large number of firms. Most of the firms manufacture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas-fired pool heaters as an adjunct to other larger lines of business, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boilers, pool and swimming equipment, etc. It appears that there are no real 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
niche markets. Nevertheless, since the proposed standards are generally not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be technologically difficult to meet, and since the forecasts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are that all standard levels are profitable, the Department does not expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant adverse impacts on small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another industry that shares the characterization of larger firms having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost advantages over smaller ones, i.e., that displays economies of scale, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fluorescent lamp ballast industry. Here, too, there has been continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation over time, and presently, three firms produce 90 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many (if not most) of the standard levels considered do not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant retooling of plant and equipment. In fact, much of the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is currently retooling in anticipation of future growth, which is due in part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to demand motivated by demand-side management programs of electric utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies. These factors, combined with the estimates that profitability will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be higher at all standard levels, imply that there will probably not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant adverse impacts on small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the impact of energy conservation standards on the television 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set industry is discussed. This industry also has undergone significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation over the past few decades. Presently, as with most of the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries discussed above, the larger firms have cost advantages over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller ones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zenith is the only domestic television set manufacturer located in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S., and it has 13 percent of the market. Therefore, there really cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any adverse small firm impacts since, domestically, there is only one firm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and it is not small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the foregoing, the Department has determined and hereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's action will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, for each of these eight industries, the Department finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the standard levels proposed in today's Proposed Rule will not ``have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department encourages the maximum level of public participation

possible in this rulemaking. Individual consumers, representatives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer groups, manufacturers, associations, States or other governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, utilities, retailers, distributors, manufacturers, and others are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged to submit written statements on the proposal. The Department also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

c. Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
 1. Procedure for Submitting Requests to Speak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The time and place of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public hearing are indicated at the beginning of this notice. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department invites any person who has an interest in these proceedings, or who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a representative of a group or class of persons having an interest, to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a written request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing. Such requests should be labeled both on the letter and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
envelope, ``Eight Products Rulemaking (Docket No. EE&hyph;RM&hyph;90&hyph;201),'' and should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sent to the address, and must be received by the time specified, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of this notice. Requests may be hand-delivered or telephoned in to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such address between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Friday, except Federal holidays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The person making the request should briefly describe the interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned and, if appropriate, state why he or she is a proper representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the group or class of persons that has such an interest, and give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone number where he or she may be contacted. Each person selected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heard will be so notified by DOE as to the approximate time they will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Each person selected to be heard is requested to submit an advance copy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of his or her statement prior to the hearing as indicated at the beginning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this notice. In the event any persons wishing to testify cannot meet this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, that person may make alternative arrangements in advance by so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating in the letter requesting to make an oral presentation.

 2. Conduct of Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department reserves the right to select the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons to be heard at the hearing, to schedule the respective presentations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to establish the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of each presentation is limited to 15 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A DOE official will be designated to preside at the hearing. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing will not be a judicial or an evidentiary-type hearing, but will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 533 and section 336 of the Act. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion of all initial oral statements at each day of the hearing, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person who has made an oral statement will be given the opportunity to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebuttal statement, subject to time limitations. The rebuttal statement will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given in the order in which the initial statements were made. The official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducting the hearing will accept additional comments or questions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those attending, as time permits. Any interested person may submit, to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presiding official, written questions to be asked of any person making a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement at the hearing. The presiding official will determine whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question is relevant, and whether time limitations permit it to be presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for answer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Further questioning of speakers will be permitted by DOE. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presiding official will afford any interested person an opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question other interested persons who made oral presentations, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees of the United States who have made written or oral presentations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to disputed issues of material fact relating to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. This opportunity will be afforded after any rebuttal statements, to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent that the presiding official determines that such questioning is likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to result in a more timely and effective resolution of such issues. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time provided is insufficient, DOE will consider affording an additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for questioning at a mutually convenient time. Persons interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making use of this opportunity must submit their request to the presiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official no later than shortly after the completion of any rebuttal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements and be prepared to state specific justification, including why the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue is one of disputed fact and how the proposed questions would expedite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any further procedural rules regarding proper conduct of the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be announced by the presiding official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A transcript of the hearing will be made, and the entire record of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, including the transcript, will be retained by DOE and made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for inspection at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided at the beginning of this notice. Any person may purchase a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transcript from the transcribing reporter.

d. Issues Requested for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above in today's notice, DOE has identified a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues where comments are requested. These issues include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The baseline units and the base cases; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consideration of incremental impacts of various standard levels; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Market share elasticities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Usage elasticities, i.e., rebound effect; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Appropriate discount rates, including those for residential and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 commercial consumer analyses (life-cycle cost and Lawrence Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Laboratory-Residential Energy Model) and the use of a social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discount rate (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Model); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Energy price forecasts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The characterization of prototypical firms for the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 impact analysis (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Model); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Efficiency forecasts for these products; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any lessening of product utility resulting from the addition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 design options identified; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The effects on forecasts due to the use of national average energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 prices and usage rates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The effects of standards on manufacturers' incentives to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 innovative products and product features; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any uncertainties in modeling, especially with regard to product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 usage, e.g., changes in usage rates as shown by survey data or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 changes in usage of features; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Location of water heaters with respect to conditioned space; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lifetimes of appliances; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Maintenance costs and failure rates of appliances and components; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The possible expansion of DOE's economic analysis to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 variable effects of standards on identifiable sub-groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 consumers, and/or the incremental effects of standards relative to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 lower or higher standard levels; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Possible modifications or alternatives to LBL's Manufacturer Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many of these issues are not unique to this proposed rule and some, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as discount rates and modifications of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturer Impact Model, have been raised in previous DOE public notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the appliance conservation standards program or by public comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these notices. Those issues and the possible expansion of DOE's economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in several areas were raised in DOE's Advance Notice of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking Regarding Energy Conservation Standards for Three Types of Consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products, published on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47326). DOE hopes that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions in these areas for this rulemaking will serve as the basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development and promulgation of future appliance conservation standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless comments in future rulemakings make a persuasive case to the contrary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to require chemical testing for use of dangerous drugs of all applicants for issuance or renewal
of licenses, certificates of registry (CORs), or merchant mariner's documents (MMDs). This action is necessary
to implement the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Testing of applicants would increase maritime
safety by providing an additional tool in the effort to promote a drug-free work place in the maritime industry.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, several major oil spills from ships have occurred in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.
Among these were the EXXON VALDEZ in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and the AMERICAN TRADER in coastal waters of California.
These spills caused extensive damage, including the loss of fish and wildlife. In response to these disasters and
others, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among other things, OPA 90 introduces new safety measures relating to vessel operations. This notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) proposes regulations to implement sections 4101(a) and (b) of OPA 90, which amend 46 U.S.C. 7101
and 7302, respectively, to require every person who applies for the issuance or renewal of a license, certificate
of registry (COR), or merchant mariner's document (MMD) to have a test for dangerous drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 46 CFR part 10, the Coast Guard issues licenses to qualified officers such as masters, mates, pilots, engineers,
operators, and radio officers, and issues CORs to qualified staff officers such as pursers, medical doctors, and
professional nurses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 7302, any person serving aboard most U.S.-flag merchant vessels of more than 100 gross
tons operating on other than rivers and lakes must be issued an MMD by the Coast Guard. This document serves as a certificate
of identification and service, authorizing work in different capacities on deck and in the engine and steward's departments.
The MMD, with an appropriate endorsement, is also the credential issued to a qualified tankerman.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory language of OPA 90 refers to the testing of an individual for the use of dangerous drugs in violation of
law or Federal regulation. Existing Coast Guard regulations are framed around the phrase ``chemical test,'' which
is already defined in 46 CFR 16.105. For the purposes of this NPRM, the chemical testing required of applicants for
issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs relates only to the use of dangerous drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 2101 by adding ``dangerous drug'' to the list of general definitions
and removes the definition of dangerous drugs from 46 U.S.C. 7503(a) and 7704(a). The definition of ``dangerous drug''
in section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 includes the term ``controlled substance.'' Although ``marijuana'' is not specifically
mentioned in the new definition, marijuana is a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. 802, and is therefore covered
by the definition of ``dangerous drug.'' This NPRM would revise the definition of ``dangerous drug'' in 46 CFR 16.105
to conform it to the definition in 46 U.S.C. 2101, as amended by section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90. This change has no substantive
effect on the existing drug testing rules in 46 CFR part 16.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 46 CFR 16.220(b) provides exceptions to the periodic chemical test requirement when there has been a recent
test for dangerous drugs or participation in a random test program. These exceptions were revised by a final rule published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 28, 1993 (58 FR 31104). The revised exceptions would apply to the new testing requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4102(b) and (c) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 7107 and 7302 to limit the terms of CORs and MMDs to 5 years. On September
16, 1993 the Coast Guard published an NPRM in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 48572) entitled ``Five-year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents''
(CGD 91&hyph;211) to implement the provisions of section 4102. Although the NPRMs for chemical testing and terms
of validity both deal with the issuance and renewal of merchant mariner's credentials, two separate documents have
been issued for ease of review by the public. This NPRM proposes additional changes to update Coast Guard regulations,
but it does not affect the regulatory amendments contained in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of
Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. In two places, 46 CFR 10.805(g) and 12.02&hyph;9(f), this NPRM
contains proposed regulatory text that would follow after additions proposed in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity
for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. One final rule may be issued combining the
requirements for chemical testing and regulations for the terms of validity for CORs and MMDs.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPA 90 requires all applicants for the issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs to have a chemical test for dangerous
drugs. The proposed rules would apply the requirement to (1) an original issuance or a renewal of a license, COR, or
MMD; (2) a raise in grade of a license or a higher grade of COR; and (3) the first endorsement on an MMD as an able seaman,
qualified member of the engine department, or tankerman. Applicants meeting either of the exceptions contained
in &sect;16.220 would be exempt from the chemical testing requirements. A chemical test for dangerous drugs would
not be required for an MMD endorsement that does not require a new expiration date for the MMD or the duplicate issuance
or replacement of valid licenses, CORs, or MMDs. If an applicant applies for multiple documentation transactions
at one time, the application is treated as a single transaction and a single drug test will satisfy the drug testing
requirements for all documentation transactions covered by the application.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 17, 1989 (54 FR 42624), the Coast Guard proposed to remove existing 46 CFR subpart 12.20 entitled ``Tankerman,''
and replace it with a new part 13, ``Tankermen and Persons in Charge of Transfer of Dangerous Liquid and Liquefied Gas.''
The Coast Guard is proposing to add chemical testing for dangerous drugs to the requirements for obtaining a tankerman
endorsement on an MMD. Because the ``Tankerman'' rulemaking has not been finalized, the proposal to add drug testing
requirements is set out as amendment to the existing requirements in 46 CFR subpart 12.20. The final rule will place
the drug testing requirements in subpart 12.20 or a new 46 CFR part 13, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Periodic chemical testing for dangerous drugs is currently part of the physical examinations required for some merchant
mariners. Entry-level ratings (46 CFR subpart 12.25), lifeboatmen (46 CFR subpart 12.10), and staff officers (46
CFR 10.801) do not require physical examinations. Existing &sect;16.220(a) states that, if a physical examination
is required, the examination must include a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The applicant must provide the results
of the chemical test for dangerous drugs to a Coast Guard Regional Examination Center (REC) where licensing and documentation
transactions take place. The proposed rules would revise &sect;16.220(a) to base testing requirements on issuance
or renewal transactions. Additionally, requirements for pilots who must undergo an annual physical examination
would be moved to a new &sect;16.220(b) and a new reporting requirement is proposed for that section. Pilots who are
not excepted from taking a chemical drug test as part of their annual physical would be required to provide drug test
results to the REC where their license was last renewed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard is soliciting comments specifically on two issues raised by this expansion of chemical testing requirements.
The first issue relates to an unemployed, nonunion applicant who is required to have a chemical test for dangerous
drugs. Under 46 CFR 16.370, which would not be amended by the proposed rules, individuals must have test results reviewed
by a Medical Review Officer (MRO) selected by the employer or sponsoring organization. However, if an applicant does
not hold a maritime-related job or belong to a union, there may be no MRO immediately available to the applicant for
reviewing test results and providing appropriate certification. The Coast Guard is interested in receiving comments
on whether this situation would pose a significant problem and requests suggestions on alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second issue relates to inactive license renewals under 46 CFR 10.209(g). Under the proposed rules, applicants
for inactive license renewals would not be required to undergo a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The Coast Guard
seeks comments on the desirability of requiring applicants for inactive license renewals to meet the chemical testing
requirements.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not major under Executive Order 12866, but is considered significant under the ``Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) because of controversy surrounding chemical
drug testing, substantial public interest, and the potential for litigation. A Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared
for this rulemaking and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

Costs to Government
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Government costs attributable to implementation of these proposed regulations would be incurred by the
17 Coast Guard RECs. Each applicant is responsible for submitting chemical test results verified by a MRO during the
``evaluation'' phase of the merchant mariner credential transaction. The additional costs, for the ``evaluation''
phase, associated with receiving and handling test results on applicants for merchant mariner credentials will
be minimal. The costs incurred as a result of this rulemaking are a relatively small percentage of the total costs of
the ``evaluation'' phase, and do not warrant revision of the current fees for evaluation related to MMD, COR or licensing
transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Costs to Public and Respondents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Firms in the maritime industry and some individual respondents (applicants) would bear the prospective incremental
costs of this rulemaking. These costs are addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost projections assume that holders of MMDs will not apply for renewals and endorsements at the same time, and
that holders of licenses will not apply for renewals and raises in grade at the same time. This approach guards against
underestimating costs. However, the projections further assume that holders of licenses who also hold MMDs will
renew licenses and MMDs together, and that the few holders of CORs and MMDs will apply for and renew CORs and MMDs together.
The cost projections were adjusted to reflect the percentage of merchant mariners that will not have to take a drug
test for the documentation transaction because they already participate in a random chemical testing program for
dangerous drugs or they have passed a drug test within the previous 185 days. Computations show that the NPRM would
subject an estimated additional 7,258 applicants for credentials each year to chemical testing for dangerous drugs.
The annual cost to the public would total $439,000.

Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dollar value of direct and societal benefits derived from the proposed rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to a 1987 report published by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, drug-free individuals_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Suffer fewer accidents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) File fewer workers' compensation claims;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use less sick leave; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Experience lower medical cost than drug users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historical data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, should this program manage to save even one life per
year at $2.5 million per statistical life saved (which recent research shows is a reasonable estimate of people's
willingness-to-pay for safety), its benefits would exceed its costs. If maritime accidents were reduced even by
a small percentage, savings would accrue to the maritime industry through lower repair and medical costs and to the
public through environmental protection.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs to small entities will probably not be significant because the costs of the additional chemical testing
for dangerous drugs will be borne primarily by individual applicants, and is less than $100 per occasion. Because
it expects the impact of this proposal on small entities to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 15 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
