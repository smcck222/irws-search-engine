SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require inspections to detect cracking in the upper row of fasteners in the lower lobe of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are approaching or have exceeded their design life goal. The actions specified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the fuselage skin and rapid loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure in the airplane. This proposal also relates to the recommendations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Assurance Task Force assigned to review Model 747 series airplanes, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that, to assure long term continued operational safety, various structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections should be accomplished.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after cracks in rivet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (AIA) of America committed to identifying and implementing procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transport category airplanes. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, with representatives from the aircraft operators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and other aviation representatives, was established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in August 1988. The objective of the Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop corrosion directed inspections and prevention programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Assess repair quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group assigned to review the Boeing Model 747 series airplanes completed its work on Item 2 in July 1989
and developed a baseline program for controlling corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness
of the Boeing Model 747 fleet. This program is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;36022, ``Aging Airplane
Corrosion Prevention and Control Program_Model 747,'' dated July 1989. The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment
39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990), which requires implementation of a corrosion prevention and control
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group completed a portion of its work on Item 1, above. The Working Group's proposal is contained in Boeing
Document Number D6&hyph;35999, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.''
The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6490 (55 FR 8374, March 7, 1990), which requires the installation
of the structural modifications identified in the Boeing Document, and AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8437
(58 FR 8693, February 17, 1993), which requires structural inspections of older airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional structural inspections are required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5580 (52 FR 7564,
March 12, 1987), which references Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, dated March 28, 1986, and Revision
1, dated September 25, 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The action being proposed herein follows from the ongoing activities of the Working Group relative to Item 1. The Working
Group has identified certain service difficulties that warrant mandatory inspections following mandatory modification
of these airplanes. The Working Group considers that these service difficulties can be controlled safely by repetitively
inspecting following modification of these airplanes, and that, because of the safety implications, the inspections
should be mandatory to assure that all operators perform them. Typically, the addressed unsafe conditions have occurred
infrequently on older airplanes, and the Working Group has a very high degree of confidence in the ability of an inspection
program to detect the damage before it impairs safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group has reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, and has recommended it to the FAA for mandatory
inspection following modification to ensure the successful long-term operation of Model 747 series airplanes.
The procedures contained in this service bulletin address reports of corrosion and cracking in the body skin of the
lap joints under the wing-to-body fairing on Model 747 series airplanes that had accumulated between 21,500 flight
hours and 33,000 flight hours. Operators have also reported finding corrosion and cracks at the lower body lap joints
forward and aft of the wing-to-body fairing on airplanes that had accumulated more than 9,000 flight hours. Additionally,
operators have reported finding fatigue cracking in the body frames adjacent to the lap joints on airplanes that had
accumulated more than 10,000 flight cycles. Continued operation of these airplanes with corroded lap joints and
cracked or broken adjacent frames could cause the skin to separate, which could lead to rapid loss of pressure in the
airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concurred with the Working Group's recommendations and has determined that AD action is warranted to mandate
the inspections to assure the continued airworthiness of the Model 747 fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2267, dated March 26, 1992, that
describes procedures for external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking in the upper
row of fasteners in the lower lobe of the fuselage skin lap joints. Certain inspections to detect cracking of the lower
lobe lap joints described in this service bulletin are required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1, which references the
original issue of this service bulletin, dated March 8, 1986, and Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986. The ``full''
modification (including the ``permanent'' repair) and the ``optional'' modification of the lower lobe lap joints
described in this service bulletin are required by AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, which also references both the original
issue of this service bulletin and Revision 1. The inspections to detect corrosion described in this service bulletin
are required by AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive external high frequency eddy current inspections to detect cracking
in the upper row of fasteners in modified lap joints, and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to
be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of this proposed AD are not intended to duplicate, rescind, or supersede the requirements of AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07
R1, AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, or AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05. The FAA's intent is to require the external HFEC inspections,
described above, of older airplanes following the mandatory modifications required by AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06,
in addition to those inspections required by AD 86&hyph;09&hyph;07 R1 and AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 118 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 124 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $804,760, or $6,820 per
airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this
AD action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed inspections would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the compliance times specified in paragraph (a) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the inspections to
be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby
minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair
Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect chafing of the
wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness.
This proposal is prompted by a report that the wiring harness on certain airplanes were produced in a configuration
that is subject to chafing and electrical shorting. The actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed during
an emergency situation.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8026 (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45893, September 9, 1991), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12, and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. That AD requires inspection to detect chafing
and modification of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. That action
was prompted by reports of chafing of the ADG electrical output harness against the backshell of the connector on the
turbine generator assembly. Although the chafing occurred while the ADG was in the stowed position, when the ADG was
deployed, the chafed wires shorted to the airplane structure and prevented the ADG from powering the essential bus.
This essential bus provides electrical power to the hydraulic flight control system and to the essential flight control
equipment. In these instances, the shorting also damaged the ADG output harness and its support structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of emergency power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for Canada, notified the FAA that the same unsafe condition addressed in AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01
may exist on certain additional Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises
that, during production of Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131,
inclusive, the wiring harnesses of the ADG's were not modified to preclude chafing against the backshell of the connector
on the turbine generator assembly. (AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 is applicable only to airplanes having serial numbers
5001 through 5098, inclusive.) Therefore, these airplanes are also subject to losing ADG power to the essential bus
when the ADG is deployed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during an emergency situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadair has issued Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0370, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1993, that describes procedures
for a one-time inspection to detect chafing and modification of the ADG wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness.
This modification entails replacing two existing harness support brackets with redesigned brackets that would
preclude chafing of the harness. The effectivity of this service bulletin includes Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16
series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131 only. Transport Canada Aviation classified this alert
service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;91&hyph;21R1, dated May 6,
1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined
the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is
necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require inspection to detect chafing and modification
of the wiring harness of the ADG, and repair of any chafed harness. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. This proposed AD would apply only to airplanes
having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the
``old'' AD is superseded by removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally
would have proposed superseding AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 to expand its applicability to include the additional affected
airplanes. However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a supersedure action, and
the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less
burdensome approach is to issue a separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede
AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 are required to continue
to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and is applicable only to airplanes
having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375,
or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification
and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350 or $694
per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $18,725 or $749 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F27 series airplanes. This proposal would require accomplishment of certain structural modifications. This proposal
is prompted by reports of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that
are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. These incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness
of the affected airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural
capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long term continued operational
safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe rather than repetitive inspections.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after tiny cracks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rivet holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and explosive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA, in concert with the Regional Airline Association (RAA); the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA); several U.S. and non-U.S. operators of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplanes; the Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Netherlands; and Fokker; has agreed to undertake the task of identifying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing procedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commuter-class airplanes. This group reviewed selected service bulletins, applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker Model F27 series airplanes, to be recommended for mandatory rulemaking action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the continued operational safety of these airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This group's proposal is contained in Fokker Report Number SE&hyph;278, ``F27 Aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft Project-Final Document,'' Issue 3, dated February 1, 1993. This Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references modifications from eight service bulletins and recommends that they be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the applicable Fokker Model F27 series airplanes. The modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consist of three modifications to the fuselage, two modifications to the wing, and three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications to the empennage of the airplane. They include structural reinforcement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frames, ribs, and stringers; replacement of formers and ribs; and installation of inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doors and covers, access holes, and drain holes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures described in these service bulletins are intended to positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address conditions identified in Model F27 series airplanes that, if not corrected, could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in structural failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RLD classified this Report as mandatory and issued Netherlands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;058/5 (A), dated July 16, 1993, in order to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since fatigue cracking and corrosion are likely to exist or develop on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require modification of Fokker Model F27 series airplanes prior to their economic design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal in accordance with the Fokker Report described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic design goal of an airplane is typically considered to be the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service after which a substantial increase in the maintenance costs is expected to take place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to assure continued operational safety. The economic design goal for Fokker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model F27 series airplanes is 90,000 landings for structural problems associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatigue damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed compliance time for implementation of the mandatory structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification program is prior to reaching the applicable economic design goal. This time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval was determined based upon the ability of the manufacturer to provide the parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the modification, and the time necessary to incorporate the modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim, safety will be provided by various means currently in place that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered satisfactory to detect damage prior to the occurrence of an unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These include operators' on-going basic maintenance programs; continuing inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by numerous previously issued AD's; the Structural Integrity Program (SIP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, previously mandated by AD 92&hyph;19&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8365 (57 FR 42693, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 16, 1992); the FAA's increased emphasis on surveillance of operators' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance programs and procedures; and the FAA's participation in programs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically inspect high-time airplanes during scheduled heavy maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 58 Fokker Model F27 series airplanes (excluding Mark 050 series airplanes) of U.S. registry
would be affected by this proposed AD within the initial threshold. Since not all affected airplanes would be required
to accomplish every modification referenced in each of the service bulletins, the cost impact of the proposed modifications
is estimated in the following table. This cost includes the price of modification kits, and the estimated labor rate
is $55 per work hour. It does not include the cost of downtime, planning, set up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.

Based on these figures, above, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,958,245.75.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed modifications would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the threshold specified in each of the service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulletins referenced by the Fokker Report should allow ample time for the accomplishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the modifications coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require the implementation of a corrosion prevention and control program either by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishing specific tasks or by revising the maintenance inspection program to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a program. This proposal is prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fatigue cracking in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their economic design goal; these incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degradation of the structural capabilities of the airplane due to the problems associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with corrosion.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1988, a high-cycle transport category airplane (specifically, a Boeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model 737) was involved in an accident in which the airplane suffered major structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage during flight. Investigation of this accident revealed that the airplane had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous fatigue cracks and a great deal of corrosion. Subsequent inspections conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the operator on other high-cycle transport category airplanes in its fleet revealed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes had extensive fatigue cracking and corrosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prompted by the data gained from this accident, the FAA sponsored a conference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on aging airplanes in June 1988, which was attended by representatives from the aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry and airworthiness authorities from around the world. It became obvious that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of new airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older technology airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on the aging airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (AIA) of America agreed to undertake the task of identifying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing procedures to ensure the continued structural airworthiness of aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport category airplanes. An Airworthiness Assurance Task Force (AATF) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in August 1988, with members representing aircraft manufacturers, operators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authorities, and other aviation industry representatives worldwide. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of the AATF was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop corrosion-directed inspections and prevention programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Review and update the Supplemental Inspection Documents (SID); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Assess repair quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The working group assigned to review the Fokker Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed its work on Item (2) and has developed a baseline program for controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness of the Model F&hyph;27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fleet. The program is contained in Fokker Document SE&hyph;291, ``F&hyph;27 Corrosion Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program,'' with revisions through October 1, 1993. (Hereafter, this publication is referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to as ``the Document.'') The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for the Netherlands, classified this Document as mandatory and issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;113, Issue 2, dated June 26, 1992, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in The Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.1 of the Document defines three levels of corrosion: Level l corrosion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that which does not exceed certain limits; Level 2 corrosion is that which exceeds those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits; and Level 3 corrosion is significant corrosion which is potentially an urgent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Document provide general guidelines to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion prevention and control program. These guidelines address such things as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline program, implementation ages, access for inspection, repetitive inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals, operating environment, newly-acquired airplanes, general cleanliness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane, and the fact that sampling is unreliable in effectively controlling corrosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.4 of the Document sets forth the general implementation schedule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion inspection/control program. As described in that section, each ``aircraft zone'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned an ``Initial Inspection Time'' and a ``Repeat Inspection Time.'' The program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to each aircraft zone on all Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes whose age has reached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceeded the Initial Inspection Time for that zone. For airplanes that have not reached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceeded the Initial Inspection Time of the specific aircraft zone, a particular inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
task has to be performed before the airplane has reached the Initial Inspection Time for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific aircraft zone, or before the Repeat Inspection Time of the task is exceeded (a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum of 6 years), whichever occurs later. For airplanes that have already reached or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded the Initial Inspection Time of the specific aircraft zone, a particular inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has to be performed before the Repeat Inspection Time of the task is exceeded or within 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, whichever occurs first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.4 of the Document also identifies the specific aircraft zones that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the program, and describes the ``basic task'' to be accomplished in each defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft zone as part of the baseline program, along with the initial inspection time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat inspection time for each area, and other information necessary to carry out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for each area. The Document defines a ``basic task'' as including not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent visual inspections of all primary and secondary structures, but any necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repairs, application of sealants or corrosion inhibitors, and other follow-on procedures, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well. A basic task may also include detailed visual and non-destructive inspections (NDI); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where NDI's are employed, adequate standards and procedures must be developed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly recorded for the area inspected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.5 establishes the procedures for reporting the results of the inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted under the corrosion prevention and control program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2.6 provides for periodic review and update of the data contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since corrosion is likely to exist or develop on airplanes of this type design, an AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposed which would require adoption of a corrosion prevention and control program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is equivalent to or better than the program specified in the Document previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described. Operators would be permitted to accomplish this either by performing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific basic tasks described in the Document (the ``task-by-task method''), or by revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their FAA-approved maintenance program to include such a program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of the proposal sets forth the proposed compliance times for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial basic task of each affected aircraft zone. These compliance times are measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a date one year after the effective date of the final rule. (The proposed compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times are consistent with those of other similar AD's that the FAA has issued on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject.) Generally, operators would be required to complete the initial basic task before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaching the ``Initial Inspection Time'' plus one ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft zone, as detailed in the Document. The basic task would be required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated at a time interval not to exceed the ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, as detailed in the Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) includes paragraph (a)(1)(iii), which states that, for each area that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the initial inspection time for that area, operators must accomplish the initial basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
task at a minimum rate of one such area every two years, beginning one year after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the final rule. The FAA recognizes that this may cause a hardship on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some small operators; in those circumstances, the FAA anticipates evaluating requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment to the implementation rate on a case-by-case basis under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (h) of the proposed rule. (A note to this effect is included in the proposal.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that the proposal does not contain a paragraph specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address repair actions. The FAA considers that any repairs would be carried out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily as a part of each basic task, as it is defined in the Document. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously, a ``basic task'' is defined in the Document as including not only the pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, but any necessary repairs, application of corrosion inhibitors, and other follow- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on procedures, as well. Paragraph (a) contains a note to reference the portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document that defines a basic task, and to emphasize the importance of these corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of the proposal provides for an optional method of complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule. In lieu of performing the task-by-task requirements proposed in paragraph (a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators may revise their FAA-approved maintenance/inspection programs to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion prevention and control program defined in the Document or an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) also would require that, subsequent to the accomplishment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial basic task, any extensions of Repeat Inspection Time intervals specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document must be approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any operator electing to comply with proposed paragraph (b) would be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use an alternative recordkeeping method to that otherwise required by Federal Aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (FAR) section 91.417 or section 121.380, provided it is approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA and is included in a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to questions raised previously concerning recordkeeping and record retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements as they relate to the programmatic approach proposed in this AD action and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other similar proposals that have been issued applicable to other airplane models, the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 91.417(a)(2)(v) and 121.380(a)(2)(v) of the FAR require that a record be made of the current status of applicable
AD's. With regard to proposed paragraph (b), such a record would be required to be made when the maintenance/inspection
program is revised to incorporate the program specified in the Document; at that time, paragraph (b) of the AD would
be fully complied with. Regarding paragraphs (d) through (g) of this proposal, those paragraphs would impose separate
requirements; therefore, except as discussed below, separate entries would have to be made to reflect compliance
with each of those paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(a)(2)(iv) of the FAR concerns recording ``the identification of the current inspection status
of the aircraft.'' Section 91.417(a)(2)(iv) contains a similar requirement. Because proposed paragraph (b) would
require operators to revise their maintenance/inspection program to include the program specified in the Document,
each operator's program would be required to identify each inspection (e.g., ``C'' check) at which each basic task
specified in the Document will be performed on each airplane. By recording the current inspection status of each airplane,
and by maintaining a cross-reference system between these records and the maintenance/inspection program revision,
it will be possible to determine the current status of each basic task on each airplane. Once this cross-reference
system has been established, this recording provision of Sections 91 and 121 requires no additional recording beyond
what would otherwise be required normally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(a)(1) concerns ``records necessary to show that all requirements for the issuance of an airworthiness
release under section 121.709 have been met.'' Section 91.417(a)(1) contains a similar requirement. These are also
referred to as ``dirty fingerprint records.'' This provision of sections 91 and 121 requires most of the recording
that would result from this proposed AD. Each time a basic task is performed, the operator would be required to make
a ``dirty fingerprint'' record of the task, identifying what actions were accomplished. It should be noted, however,
that these records are not different from the records made for any other actions taken under the operator's maintenance/inspection
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the record making requirements, discussed above, sections 91 and 121 of the FAR impose requirements
for record retention:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(b)(1) and Section 91.417(b)(1) require that the ``dirty fingerprint'' records be retained until
the work is repeated or superseded by other work, or for one year after the work is performed. Therefore, most of the
records resulting from this proposed AD would not have to be retained indefinitely. However, such retention might
facilitate subsequent transfers, or substantiate requests for repetitive interval escalations, and therefore,
may be in the operator's interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.380(b)(2) requires that the records specified in paragraph 121.380(a)(2) [current status of AD's and
current inspection status] be retained and transferred with the airplane at the time it is sold. Section 91.417(b)(2)
contains a similar requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These recording requirements are not considered to be unduly burdensome and are considered the minimum necessary
to enable the cognizant FAA Maintenance Inspector to perform proper surveillance and to ensure that the objectives
of the proposed rule are being fulfilled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because of the numerous concerns expressed previously by operators regarding the recordkeeping obligations
imposed by section 121.380 with regard to similar rulemaking on corrosion prevention and control programs, the FAA
has included in this proposal certain provisions for alternative recordkeeping methods. Proposed paragraph (b)(1)
would provide for the development and implementation of such alternative methods, which must be approved by the FAA.
For example, operators may choose to submit proposals to record compliance with paragraphs (d) through (g) of the
AD by a means other than they normally use to record AD status. (The FAA has developed guidance material that will contain
information to be considered by FAA Principal Maintenance Inspectors (PMI) when reviewing proposals for alternative
recordkeeping methods.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of the proposal provides for increasing a ``Repeat Inspection Time'' interval by up to 10% in order to
accommodate unanticipated scheduling requirements. Operators would be required to inform the FAA within 30 days
of such increases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) of the proposal sets forth the reporting actions that are necessary to be accomplished when Level
3 corrosion is determined to exist. Within 7 days after such a determination is made, an operator would be required
to accomplish one of the following actions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Submit a report of the determination to the FAA and complete the basic task in the affected area on the remainder of
the Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Submit a proposed schedule, for approval by the FAA, for performing the basic tasks in the affected area on the remainder
of the operator's Model F&hyph;27 series fleet; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Submit data substantiating that the Level 3 corrosion was an isolated occurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the FAA has received such a report, it may, in conjunction with normal surveillance activities, request additional
information regarding the results of the basic tasks performed on the remainder of the operator's Model F&hyph;27
series fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) of the proposal specifies that the FAA may impose schedules different from what an operator has proposed
under paragraph (d)(1), if it is found that changes are necessary to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion in the operator's
Model&blank;&blank; F&hyph;27 series fleet is detected in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d)(3) of the proposal would require that, within the time schedule approved by the FAA, the operator must
accomplish the basic tasks in the affected areas on the remaining airplanes in its Model F&hyph;27 series fleet to
ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) would require that, upon finding corrosion exceeding Level 1 during a repetitive inspection, an operator
must adjust its program to ensure that future corrosion findings are limited to Level 1 or better. Where corrective
action is necessary to reduce corrosion to Level 1 or better, an operator must submit a proposal for a means of corrective
action for the FAA's approval within 60 days after the determination of corrosion is made. That means, approved by
the FAA, must then be implemented to reduce future findings of corrosion in that area to Level 1 or better.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to paragraph (e), it should be noted that if corrosion is found and it is not considered representative
of the operator's fleet, no further corrective action may be necessary, since a means to reduce any corrosion to Level
1 or better will have already been implemented in the operator's program in accordance with proposed paragraph (a)
or (b). For example, if a finding of corrosion is attributable to a particular spill of mercury or other unique event,
or if corrosion is found on an airplane recently acquired from another operator, the means specified in the existing
program may be adequate for controlling corrosion in the remainder of the operator's fleet. Similarly, if an operator
has already implemented means to reduce corrosion in an airplane area based on previous findings, no additional corrective
action may be necessary. In reviewing the reports submitted in accordance with the AD, the FAA will monitor the effectiveness
of the operator's means to reduce corrosion. If the FAA determines that an operator has failed to implement adequate
means to reduce corrosion to Level 1 or better, appropriate action will be taken to ensure compliance with this paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f) of the proposal concerns adding airplanes to an operator's fleet, and the procedures that must be followed
with regard to corrosion prevention and control. This paragraph differentiates between procedures applicable
to added airplanes that previously were maintained in accordance with this AD and those that were not so maintained.
For airplanes that previously have been maintained in accordance with the proposed requirements of this AD action,
the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator would be required to be performed in accordance
with either the previous operator's or the new operator's inspection schedule, whichever would result in the earlier
accomplishment date for that task. For airplanes that have not been maintained in accordance with the proposed requirements
of this AD action, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator would be required to
be performed before the airplane is placed in service, or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the requirements of paragraph (f), the FAA considers it essential that operators ensure that transferred
airplanes are inspected in accordance with the baseline corrosion prevention and control program on the same basis
as if there were continuity in ownership. Scheduling of the inspections for each airplane must not be delayed or postponed
due to a transfer of ownership; in some cases, such postponement could continue indefinitely if an airplane is transferred
frequently from one owner to another. The proposed rule would require that the specified procedures be accomplished
before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the requirements of the proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g) of the proposal would require that reports of Level 2 and Level 3 corrosion be submitted to Fokker within
certain time periods after such corrosion is detected. A note has been included in this paragraph indicating that
reporting to the FAA of any Level 2 or Level 3 corrosion found as a result of any opportunity inspections is highly desirable.
Operators are not relieved, however, from reporting corrosion findings as required by FAR section 121.703.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 55 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take an average
of approximately 7 work hours per basic task to accomplish the 75 basic tasks called out in the Document; this represents
a total average of 525 work hours. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators for the 6-year average inspection cycle is estimated to be $1,588,125,
or $28,875 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore
that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit
analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

(2) Repeat each basic task at a time interval not to exceed the RIT interval specified in the Document for that task.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD: Prior to one year after the effective date of this
AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program to include the corrosion control program specified
in the Document; or to include an equivalent program that is approved by the FAA. In all cases, the initial basic task
for each airplane area must be completed in accordance with the compliance schedule specified in paragraph (a)(1)
of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any operator complying with paragraph (b) of this AD may use an alternative recordkeeping method to that otherwise
required by FAR section 91.417 or section 121.380 for the actions required by this AD, provided it is approved by the
FAA and is included in a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance/inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subsequent to the accomplishment of the initial basic task, extensions of RIT intervals specified in the Document
must be approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) To accommodate unanticipated scheduling requirements, it is acceptable for an RIT interval to be increased by
up to 10%, but not to exceed 6 months. The FAA must be informed, in writing, of any such extension within 30 days after
such adjustment of the schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) If, as a result of any inspection conducted in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this AD, Level 3 corrosion
is determined to exist in any airplane area, accomplish either paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) within 7 days after
such determination: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Submit a report of that determination to the FAA and complete the basic task in the affected aircraft zones on all
Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Submit to the FAA for approval one of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A proposed schedule for performing the basic tasks in the affected aircraft zones on the remaining Model F&hyph;27
series airplanes in the operator's fleet, which is adequate to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected
in a timely manner, along with substantiating data for that schedule; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Data substantiating that the Level 3 corrosion found is an isolated occurrence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2.1 of the Document, which would permit corrosion that otherwise meets
the definition of Level 3 corrosion (i.e., which is determined to be a potentially urgent airworthiness concern requiring
expeditious action) to be treated as Level 1 if the operator finds that it ``can be attributed to an event not typical
of the operator's usage of other airplanes in the same fleet,'' this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that data substantiating any such finding be submitted to the FAA (ref. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The FAA may impose schedules other than those proposed, upon finding that such changes are necessary to ensure
that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within the time schedule approved under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this AD, accomplish the basic tasks in the
affected aircraft zones of the remaining Model F&hyph;27 series airplanes in the operator's fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If, as a result of any inspection after the initial inspection conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)
of this AD, it is determined that corrosion findings exceed Level 1 in any area, within 60 days after such determination,
implement a means, approved by the FAA, to reduce future findings of corrosion in that area to Level 1 or better. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this AD, a schedule for the accomplishment of basic tasks required by this AD must be established in
accordance with paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this AD, as applicable: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For airplanes previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be
performed by the new operator must be accomplished in accordance with the previous operator's schedule or with the
new operator's schedule, whichever would result in the earlier accomplishment date for that task. After each basic
task has been performed once, each subsequent task must be performed in accordance with the new operator's schedule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For airplanes that have not been previously maintained in accordance with this AD, the first basic task for each
aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator must be accomplished prior to further flight or in accordance with
a schedule approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Within 7 days after the date of detection of any Level 3 corrosion, and within 3 months after the date of detection
of any Level 2 corrosion, submit a report to Fokker of such findings, in accordance with section 2.5 of the Document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is exempted from review by the office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Reduction
of Regulatory Burden).

Compliance With Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking represents the next step in the process of licensing the world's first commercial
low-earth orbit satellites offering both voice and data mobile satellite services (MSS). These satellites are to
operate in the 1610&hyph;1626.5/2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz frequency bands (1.6/2.4 GHz bands). The proposed systems
are to provide a wide range of services, including cellular-like mobile services to users anywhere, telephone service
to remote areas that are not linked to a communications network, position location services, search and rescue communications,
disaster management communications, environmental monitoring, paging services, facsimile transmission services,
cargo tracking, educational communications, and industrial monitoring. In addition to offering these services
to users in the United States, the proposed low-earth orbit systems have the capability to extend these offerings
throughout the world. This can potentially expand markets for U.S.-developed goods and services and to make a major
contribution to U.S. global competitiveness. It also offers the potential for significant economic and social advances
in developing countries by providing an ``instant'' telecommunications infrastructure at minimum cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six applications to construct satellite systems in these frequency bands were filed by the cut-off date. Five proposed
low-Earth orbit (LEO) systems. These were filed by Ellipsat Corporation, Motorola Satellite Communications Inc.,
Constellation Communications, Loral/Qualcomm Corporation, and TRW, Inc. The other application was filed by American
Mobile Satellite Corporation. AMSC proposed to add the additional MSS frequencies to its geostationary satellite
orbit (GSO) MSS system that was authorized in 1989. An international allocation for MSS in these frequency bands was
made in February 1992; a domestic allocation was adopted in December 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A negotiated rulemaking was undertaken from January through April 1993 to assist the Commission in establishing
technical and operational rules to govern this new service (hereinafter 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS) and in developing an arrangement
by which all six pending system proposals could be accommodated. Neither the Commission nor the applicants were able
to fashion a spectrum sharing compromise that was acceptable to all. The Committee did, however, reach consensus
regarding other major technical issues. After the Negotiated Rulemaking was concluded, the LEO applicants, in two
new ``partial settlement'' groups, submitted two new sharing proposals they assert would permit all LEO applications
to be granted. Both proposals are premised on excluding GSO systems from consideration for licensing in these frequency
bands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the applicants can develop or agree to an engineering solution or sharing scheme by which all proposed systems can
be accommodated, the Commission generally adopts this approach if it is otherwise in the public interest. In situations
where all applicants' proposed systems cannot be accommodated, the Commission must devise a method consistent with
the public interest for choosing among them. In such cases, the Commission has, as an initial matter, imposed rigorous
financial and technical requirements as a means of ensuring that those granted licenses are capable of expeditiously
implementing state-of-the-art systems that will serve the public interest. If it is not possible to accommodate
all qualified applicants, a further processing mechanism must be selected.

As a means of encouraging new technology and of realizing the unique benefits that a global system can provide, the
Commission proposes a LEO design requirement (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(i)). It solicits comment on this
proposal from both applicants and potential users, requesting that commenters address the potential for 1.6/2.4
GHz MSS systems to generate social, economic, and technical benefits, both domestically and globally, and the extent
to which these benefits are realizable with LEO and GSO satellites. The Commission further proposes that systems
be capable of serving all areas of the world, except for the polar regions, for at least 75% of each day. Specifically,
the Commission proposes that satellite systems be designed so that at least one satellite is visible above the horizon
at an elevation angle of at least 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; for at least 18 hours each day at latitudes less than 80
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(11)). To provide efficient and ubiquitous service to users throughout
the United States, the Commission also proposes to require systems to be capable of providing continuous voice services
to all areas of the United States (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(iii)). That is, satellite systems must be designed
so that at least one satellite is visible above the horizon at elevation angles of at least 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; at any given time in all areas of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Commission proposes strict financial qualification requirements identical to those in the domestic
fixed-satellite service, where applications to implement space stations regularly exceed the number that can be
accommodated (proposed &sect;25.143(b)(3)). Specifically, the Commission proposes that MSS applicants be required
to provide evidence of current assets or irrevocably committed debt or equity financing sufficient to meet the estimated
costs of constructing and launching all planned satellites and operating the system for one year. These requirements
stem from the Commission's repeated experience that licensees without sufficient resources spend a significant
amount of time attempting to raise the capital needed to finance a satellite system (here, $97 million to $2 billion),
that these attempts often end unsuccessfully, and that qualified fully-financed applicants may be blocked from
entry during this several-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All applicants will be given the opportunity to amend their applications to bring them into compliance with any final
rules.

While a sharing solution could not be developed during the Negotiated Rulemaking, the Commission believes that the
recent LEO sharing proposals may form the basis for allowing it to proceed expeditiously with licensing. Both of the
LEO applicants' proposals appear to allow up to five LEO systems to be accommodated in the 16.5 MHz of spectrum allocated
to MSS in each transmission direction. This may be sufficient to allow all qualified applicants to be licensed.

The Commission proposes to assign licensees implementing code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems to 11.35
MHz of shared bandwidth at 1610&hyph;1621.35 MHz. It further proposes to assign a frequency division multiple access
(FDMA)/time division access (TDMA) system to 5.15 MHz of dedicated bandwidth at 1621.35&hyph;1626.5 MHz. When a
system is launched and read to begin operating, it will be permitted to operate over the entire assigned bandwidth
for that technology. Any in-orbit CDMA system will be required to operate compatibly with any newly launched CDMA
system. If only one CDMA system is implemented, the plan proposes to adjust the assignments for the system to 8.25 MHz
at 1610&hyph;1618.25 MHz, leaving the freed spectrum available for possible reassignment to the FDMA licensee or
for new entry. The Commission believes that 8.25 MHz should be ample to support a first-generation system and should
provide some flexibility in coordinating the system internationally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan includes the 1.6 GHz band only. While CDMA systems will use the 2.4 GHz band for downlink transmissions, an
FDMA/TDMA system will use the 1.6 GHz band for both uplink and downlink transmissions. This may free some spectrum
in the 2.4 GHz band and provide some flexibility in assigning specific downlink spectrum segments to CDMA licensees.
For example, the Commission may decide to avoid licensing in those portions of the 2.4 GHz band that are especially
susceptible to inter-service interference. Thus, while the Commission proposes to license CDMA operators to share
the same amount of 2.4 GHz downlink spectrum as 1.6 GHz uplink spectrum, it does not propose specific frequencies for
downlink operations at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Other Alternatives if Mutual Exclusivity is Not Resolved
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Commission's spectrum sharing plan, or some variation of it, does not permit the applications of all qualified
applicants to be granted, the Commission must devise a procedure for choosing among those applicants. Possibilities
include a comparable hearing, an auction, or a lottery. These alternatives are briefly discussed and, to expedite
licensing if mutual exclusivity is not resolved, the Commission proposes structures for both an auction and a lottery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's experience with comparative hearings has shown they usually are prolonged. Here, they would not
only delay the provision of needed service to the United States public, but the delay could disadvantage the United
States in coordinating a licensed system internationally. For these reasons, it may not be advisable to hold a comparative
hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Budget Act gives the Commission the authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to select licensees
from among two or more mutually exclusive applicants provided that certain criteria are met. The Commission believes
it mutual exclusivity among the applicants cannot be resolved, an auction may be considered. Specifically, MSS licensees
will be providing a commercial subscription-based service that will enable subscribers to transmit or receive MSS
transmissions in the frequencies on which the MSS space stations will be licensed to operate. A competitive bidding
system should permit a new service to be more rapidly introduced than would a comparative hearing. It should also allow
the public to recover the value of the public spectrum resource being made available for commercial use. Further,
it should encourage efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum by encouraging applicants to bid on only the minimum
amount of spectrum needed. The Commission recognizes that the statute also directs it to promote economic opportunity
by disseminating licenses to a wide variety of licensees, including small and minority businesses. It requests comment
on the manner in which this statutory obligation can be taken into account. The Commission also recognizes that an
auction may have unintended consequences internationally by encouraging other countries to impose licensing costs
on MSS systems. The Commission will carefully consider these concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission envisions that if an auction is employed, it will be conducted pursuant to the general framework adopted
in its Competitive Bidding Implementation Proceeding (PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253). The Commission also proposes
service-specific criteria. To maximize multiple entry and to encourage applicants to bid only for the minimum amount
of spectrum they require, the Commission proposes to auction the 16.5 MHz of bandwidth in each transmission direction
in eight paired 2.0625 MHz uplink and downlink segments. Based on the applicants' proposals, it appears that some
MSS systems could be implemented with as little as 2 to 4 MHz of spectrum in each transmission direction. To afford licensees
some flexibility, however, the Commission proposes to allow applicants to big successfully on up to four segments,
for a total of 8.25 MHz of bandwidth in each transmission direction. Given the CDMA applicants' proposals to share
spectrum, the Commission also questions whether it should permit successful bidders to agree to pool their spectrum
and implement co-frequency systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 309(i) of the Budget Act also authorizes the use of a lottery to select from among one or more mutually exclusive
applicants if the applications are accepted for filing before July 26, 1993. The Commission tentatively concludes
that if mutual exclusivity cannot be resolved, the statutory requirements for a system of random selection are met.
The Commission proposes to implement a lottery in a manner similar to its proposed auction framework. Specifically,
eight 2.0625 MHz paired segments would be offered, and each selectee would be limited to four segments. The Commission
questions whether it may be advisable to permit applicants to agree among themselves that they will implement co-frequency
systems if one of them is chosen as the tentative selectee, allowing the Commission to grant licenses to all qualified
applicants in the pool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interservice Sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The radioastronomy service (RAS), the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARS), the instructional television
fixed-service (ITFS), a variety of terrestrial services, and industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) equipment
all operate in portions of the bands allocated to MSS or in adjacent bands. The Committee studied the potential for
interference between MSS and these services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee, which included an RAS representative, reached a consensus regarding MSS&hyph;RAS sharing. These
recommendations, which form the basis for the Commission's proposed rules (&sect;25.213(a)), establish fixed
radius protection zones around the sixteen radio astronomy sites in the United States and set technical requirements
for MSS downlink transmissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System, is operating in the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band pursuant to
International Radio Regulation RR 732. MSS stations may not cause harmful interference to or claim protection from
stations operating under RR 732. During the Negotiated Rulemaking, the FAA indicated that it sought to use GLONASS
in conjunction with the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide aircraft ground approach and terminal communications.
The Committee determined that MSS can coexist with GLONASS now, but if GLONASS were used as proposed by the FAA, the
GLONASS/MSS interference problems at 1610&hyph;1616 MHz would be unresolvable. The Committee proposed that GLONASS
be moved below the 1610 MHz band or, in the alternative, that U.S. reliance on GLONASS be lessened or eliminated. Both
inter-agency and international negotiations have been initiated on this issue. We are encouraged that even if GLONASS
is used for aircraft approach communications, it will be moved to frequencies below 1610 MHz. The Committee's proposed
rules regarding e.i.r.p. limits pursuant to RR 731F and limitations on the use of MSS terminals on aircraft fall within
accepted international standards and are set forth for comment (proposed &sect;25.213(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also suggested a variety of solutions to the likely interference problems between MSS and other services,
ranging from relocating existing licensees (e.g., ``grandfathered'' terrestrial stations operating in the 2483.5&hyph;2500
MHz band) to imposing stricter suppression requirements on transmissions in adjacent frequency bands (e.g., ITFS
stations operating above 2500 MHz). However, these interests were not represented on the Committee, nor were the
interests of ISM operators in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band. In these cases, the Commission does not believe that
it can propose sharing rules without developing the record more fully. It therefore requests comment on the interference
environment and possible solutions from affected operators.

Feeder Links 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the fixed-satellite frequencies to be used for LEO MSS feeder links may also be used by GSO satellites, the Committee
studied the sharing potential between LEO and GSO satellites. It concluded that sharing was feasible. The Committee
also studied the obligations of the United States under RR 2613, which essentially requires a LEO operator to cease
operations when unacceptable interference is cause to a GSO system. To afford LEO operators some protection, the
Committee suggested that the U.S. seek international agreement that RR 2613 will not be invoked to require a LEO operator
to terminate transmissions unless: (1) The affected administrations reach agreement as to a level of ``accepted
interference,'' (2) the LEO system is operating in excess of these levels, and (3) the excess interference is caused
by the LEO satellite's failure to maintain sufficient angular separation between the satellites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission accepted the Committee's analysis that sharing between LEO feeder links and GSO systems is feasible
with coordination. Further, the Commission agrees with the Committee's interpretation of RR 2613 and has already
begun to explore, in international forums, issues relating to international coordination of and protection for
LEO system feeder links. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several applicants request feeder links in the 5/6 GHz frequency bands (C-band); other request the 20/30 GHz bands
(Ka-band). The FAA opposes feeder links at 5 GHz, arguing that feeder link operations would be incompatible with its
intended use of the band for new navigation aids. In a related Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the
Local Multi-point Distribution Service (CC Docket No. 92&hyph;297; FCC No. 94&hyph;12) 59 FR 7964, February 17.
1994 adopted the same day as this Notice, the Commission proposes to conduct a negotiated rulemaking to assist it in
assigning the 27.5&hyph;30.0 GHz frequency band. It expects, in the context of that proceeding, to be able to identify
sufficient spectrum to satisfy 1.6/2/4 GHz MSS operators. The Commission will, however, continue to pursue feeder
links at 5 GHz and will allow applicants to incorporate these bands or other bands if they become available.

The 1993 Budget Act requires that the provision of space segment capacity directly to commercial mobile radio service
(CMRS) providers be treated as common carriage. However, the Act gives the Commission the discretion to determine
whether the provision of space segment capacity to CMRS providers should be treated as common carriage. (Most of the
pending applicants propose to offer service through resellers.) The Commission tentatively concludes that 1.6/2.4
GHz MSS offering will, in most cases, fall within the definition of CMRS. The Commission requests comment on whether
1.6/2.4 GHz MSS space station licensees making satellite capacity available to CMRS providers should be required
to operate as common carriers. Specifically, the Commission requests comment regarding whether there may be any
public interest reasons to impose a legal compulsion upon 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS operators to serve the public indifferently,
and whether a decision to exempt operators from common carriage requirements will allow them to engage in unreasonable
or anticompetitive practices. The Commission recognizes that requiring common carriage may limit the amount of
foreign participation in these inherently global systems, potentially impeding international coordination of
these satellites. The Commission requests comment on the extent to which applicants are seeking foreign investment
and the extent to which a common carriage requirement may impact their plans. The Commission also requests comment
regarding the likelihood that 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS space station capacity will inherently be offered as an indifferent
holding out to the public.

Mobile Earth Station Licensing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposes to license gateway and tracking, telemetry and control (TT&amp;C) stations as fixed-satellite
earth stations under part 25 of the Commission's Rules. It also proposes a blanket licensing approach for mobile user
transceivers under which a service vendor would hold the authorization for a specified number of technically identical
units. The Commission's proposals for earth station licensing are contained in &sect;&sect;25.115(d) (applications
for earth station authorizations); 25.130(b) (filing requirements for transmitting earth stations); 25.133(b)
(period of construction; commencement of construction); 25.136 (operating provisions for earth station networks
in the 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite service); and 25.213 (technical requirements for the 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite
service). The Commission requests comment on these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help maintain an interference-free environment, the Commission proposes to require an end user to obtain the authorization
of the space station operator, either directly or through an authorized service vendor, before the user may transmit
to that system. The Commission believes that this approach will facilitate roaming by international user while still
protecting the domestic electromagnetic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory treatment of earth station licensees will depend upon whether they will be providing CMRS, although
the Commission expects that they will. Earth station licensees that provide CMRS must be regulated as common carriers.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 114 currently requires automatic transmission vehicles with a ``park'' position on their transmission
to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission is locked in ``park'' or becomes
locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. In other words, under the first alternative, a vehicle
must be designed so that the key cannot be removed when the transmission shift lever or other shifting mechanism is
in any position other than ``park.'' NHTSA is proposing to amend this provision to prevent key removal only when the
shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position other than ``park.'' This
rulemaking action results from a petition submitted by Mazda. The agency believes that the proposed amendment would
provide greater flexibility to manufacturers, and not have any measurable impact on safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 30, 1990, NHTSA amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 114, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Theft Protection,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to protect against injuries to children caused by vehicle rollaway in vehicles with automatic transmissions, where
children were able to shift the transmission of a parked vehicle. 55 FR 21868. The amendment required automatic transmission
vehicles with a ``park'' position to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission
is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. The amendment became effective
on September 1, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In adopting the amendment, the agency explained that a study focusing on child-injuring rollaway accidents in Orange
County, California demonstrated that injuries caused by rolling vehicles posed a significant safety problem. That
study uncovered nine cases of children releasing the brake or moving the transmission shift lever, or both, causing
a parked vehicle to roll and injure the child operating the controls or children near the vehicle. Even though two of
the cases could be discounted for the purposes of the rulemaking in question because the vehicle's engine was running
and there was insufficient information to draw conclusions about some other situations, the study did establish
that the type of accident at issue was occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA explained that although the then-current Standard No. 114 did not prohibit systems which permit the transmission
lever to be shifted when the vehicle is parked and the ignition is locked, some manufacturers had voluntarily used
a transmission shift lever lock that precludes this possibility. The agency stated that these transmission shift
lever lock designs typically have two critical elements. First, the transmission shift lever lock requires the transmission
shift lever to be in ``park'' before a person can remove the key. Second, the device also prevents shifting the transmission
lever from ``park'' to another position once the key is removed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA estimated that installation of the required technology in the cars and light trucks not voluntarily equipped
by the rule's effective date would prevent an estimated 50 to 100 child-injuring rollaway accidents annually. The
agency stated that these injuries could be prevented at a relatively low cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 2, 1993, Mazda submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting that the agency amend the provision added
by the May 1990 final rule. That company claimed that an amendment was needed to clarify the requirement to make the
compliance test procedure ``objective.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mazda stated that, in a December 12, 1992 letter, NHTSA had notified it of an apparent noncompliance with Standard
No. 114. By way of explanation, the agency had sent Mazda a copy of a November 20, 1992 interpretation letter to Ford.
That interpretation letter was a response to a Ford letter written to NHTSA concerning a compliance issue for certain
of its keylocking systems which had been designed by Mazda. In its petition, Mazda stated that it was aware of at least
five other manufacturers which had been informed of apparent noncompliances with that same provision of Standard
No. 114.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its November 20, 1992 interpretation letter to Ford, NHTSA rejected a request by that company to interpret Standard
No. 114 to prevent key removal only when the transmission shift lever is in one of the available gear positioning detents
other than ``park,'' i.e., reverse, neutral, drive, first, or second, and not when the lever is at points between those
detents. The agency stated that following: We cannot agree with your suggested interpretation, as it is inconsistent
with the express language of S4.2.1. That section states that, with certain exceptions not at issue, the key-locking
system must prevent removal of the key unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in ``park'' or
becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. Stated more simply, key removal must be prevented
in all circumstances save those specified in S4.2.1. Neither the transmission nor the transmission shift lever is
locked in ``park'' when the lever is between the gear selector positioning detents. Therefore, under section S4.2.1,
key removal must be prevented in that situation, unless the transmission/transmission shift lower becomes locked
in ``park'' as a direct result of removing the key.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition, Mazda characterized the agency's interpretation as permitting ``intentional mispositioning''
of the transmission shift lever during compliance testing. That company argued that during the design and development
of the vehicles which are the subject of the agency's December 1, 1992 letter, it never understood ``intentional mispositioning''
to be a reasonable and legitimate means for testing compliance with Standard No. 114. It also argued that even if it
had such an understanding, it is not at all clear what kind of certification test procedure it would have used to assure
that key removal could not occur in any possible situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mazda also argued that it had reexamined the rulemaking record and found nothing to indicate that ``intentional mispositioning''
of the transmission shift lever was ever contemplated. In addition, Mazda alleged that even if this is now believed
by NHTSA to be an appropriate aspect of the performance required by the standard, the absence of an objective test procedure
for determining compliance with the standard results in a lack of objectivity and fails to satisfy the requirements
of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mazda requested that Standard No. 114 be amended to incorporate a provision that it considers to set forth an objective
performance requirement. The provision would specify testing with the transmission level in each detent position,
and moving the lever from detent position to detent position using force levels specified by the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA rejects Mazda's claim that the existing provision in Standard No. 114 is non-objective. There is nothing subjective
about a requirement that a key-locking system must prevent removal of the key unless the transmission or transmission
shift lever is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. As discussed
in the agency's interpretation letter, key removal must be prevented in all circumstances save those specified in
S4.2.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency rejects Mazda's objectivity argument, NHTSA does believe it is appropriate to address in rulemaking
whether Standard No. 114 should be amended along the lines suggested by that company, albeit for different reasons.
In the preamble to the May 1990 final rule, the agency stated that it believed the injuries in question could be prevented
at a relatively low cost to manufacturers since most vehicles would already comply with the amendments. This belief
was based on the fact that the vast majority of vehicles with automatic transmissions already had transmission locking
systems or had already been scheduled to have newly designed systems installed. The agency assumed that all of those
locking systems were or would be designed in a manner that would comply with the requirements. However, it now appears
that some of these transmission locking systems do not comply with the requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on agency testing of post-September 1, 1992 vehicles, the agency estimates that approximately 650,000 model
year 1993 passenger cars and 18,000 light trucks do not meet the present requirement. For the final rule, the agency
estimated the consumer cost of redesigning the transmission key-locking system to be $6.75 to $14.00 per vehicle.
Those are maximum figures that include both the situation where a complying system must be installed and the situation
in which an existing system need only be adjusted in order to comply. In that respect, those figures likely overstate
costs for this rulemaking, especially those applicable to an existing system needing only a minor adjustment. Additionally,
some manufacturers have likely modified model year 1993 systems to comply with the existing requirements. Therefore,
the actual numbers of passenger cars and light trucks that do not now meet the requirements are probably less than the
estimates suggested above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since NHTSA did not anticipate the need for manufacturers to redesign a large number of transmission locking systems,
the agency believes that it should consider whether it is appropriate to require such redesign. This is particularly
true to the extent that the apparently noncomplying locking systems at issue result in essentially the same child-injury
prevention safety benefits as would occur if the systems were redesigned to comply with the current requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, Standard No. 114 currently requires automatic transmission vehicles with a ``park'' position
to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission is locked in ``park'' or becomes
locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. In other words, under the first alternative, a vehicle
must be designed so that the key cannot be removed when the transmission shift lever or other shifting mechanism is
in any position other than ``park.'' NHTSA is proposing to amend Standard No. 114 to instead require a key-locking
system that prevents removal of the key: (1) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in
the park position, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism are locked in park or become locked in
``park'' as the direct result of removing the key, and (2) whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully
placed in any designated shift position other than park, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism
become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. The standard would no longer address key removal
when the transmission shift lever is between shift positions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NHTSA notes that, for nearly all current designs, the key cannot be removed if the transmission shift lever is in a
detent other than park. However, electronic designs can be produced which permit the key to be removed while the transmission
is in a position such as drive and then automatically move the shifting mechanism and transmission to park. Both the
existing language of Standard No. 114 and the proposed language permit such designs.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic rationale for limiting the key-removal requirement to situations where the transmission shift lever is
in detent positions is that drivers are unlikely to attempt to remove the key when the transmission shift lever is between
shift positions. As a practical matter, drivers are likely to either leave the transmission in the gear they had last
used or attempt to put the transmission in park, before attempting key removal. The only chance for mispositioning
is therefore in the latter situation, and the agency believes the chance for such mispositioning is small. Therefore,
as a practical matter, when the agency decided to prohibit key removal in situations where the transmission was not
in park, it was essentially addressing situations where the shift lever was in detent positions other than park. A
more complete discussion of this rationale, which addresses the transmission designs currently at issue, is provided
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the key-removal requirement would be limited to situations where the shift mechanism is fully placed in any
designated shift position, it would be necessary for the agency to specify a means for determining whether the mechanism
is in such position. Under the proposal, a vehicle would be considered to be in ``park'' when the transmission gear
selection indicator shows that ``park'' has been selected and the vehicle will not roll away on an incline when the
parking brake is disengaged. A vehicle would be considered to be in a drive gear when the transmission gear selection
indicator shows that a drive gear has been selected and the vehicle can be moved under its own power. A vehicle would
be considered to be in ``neutral'' if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``neutral'' has been selected,
the vehicle is stopped, and activation of the accelerator pedal does not cause the vehicle to move.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of assessing the safety implications of the proposed amendment, it is necessary to evaluate the types of locking
systems that would likely be produced under it. NHTSA believes that the most likely types of systems are ones like the
Mazda-designed locking system that was the subject of the agency's November 1992 interpretation letter and the other
locking systems that led the agency to issue letters concerning apparent noncompliances.

Ford and Mazda first advised the agency of a possible compliance issue concerning the Mazda-designed locking system
in September 1992, shortly after the requirement at issue became effective. Ford advised that if key removal were
attempted while the transmission shift lever on a large proportion of 1993 Escorts and Tracers was placed at various
points between the ``reverse'' and ``park'' detents, the key could be removed while the selector lever was held short
of engaging the ``park'' detent, and without the transmission becoming locked in park. Ford and Mazda also demonstrated
these vehicles to NHTSA personnel. These personnel found that the transmission shift lever could be moved to a position
where it appeared to be in ``park,'' but where in fact the lever was not fully in the ``park'' position. After releasing
the shift lever in this position, the personnel could remove the key without the transmission's becoming locked in
park.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, in its November 1992 interpretation letter, NHTSA rejected Ford's suggestion that the agency
interpret Standard No. 114 to prevent key removal only when the transmission shift lever is in one of the available
gear positioning detents other than ``park.'' The agency stated that its interpretation was consistent with the
agency's intent in promulgating S4.2.1, explaining: As discussed in several rulemaking notices, NHTSA amended
Standard No. 114 to prevent vehicle rollaway caused by unattended children shifting the transmission lever in automatic
transmission vehicles. If a driver were able to remove the key while the transmission or transmission shift lever
were not locked in park, and if the transmission or transmission shift lever did not become locked in ``park'' as a result
of removing the key, a child might later shift the transmission shift lever, thereby causing a vehicle rollaway. For
this reason, we continue to believe that this amendment to Standard No. 114 meets the need for motor vehicle safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to issuing the November 1992 interpretation letter, the agency conducted a number of compliance tests
for Standard No. 114. As a result of these tests, the agency sent letters to Mazda, Ford, Honda, GM, Suzuki, and Hyundai,
advising that, for certain of their vehicles, there was an apparent noncompliance with Standard No. 114's provision
requiring that key removal be prevented unless the transmission or transmission shift lever is locked in park or becomes
locked in park as a direct result of removing the key. (Copies of the correspondence between NHTSA and these manufacturers,
and the compliance test reports for the vehicles at issue, have been placed in the docket for this NPRM.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of the vehicles for which tests showed apparent noncompliances, it was possible to remove the ignition key
from the key-locking system when the transmission shift lever was in a position between ``park'' and ``reverse,''
without the transmission becoming locked in ``park'' as a result of removing the key. The circumstances under which
the ignition key could be removed when the transmission shift lever was between ``park'' and ``reverse'' varied.
For some vehicles, the lever could simply be placed in a position between park and reverse, the hand that controlled
it removed, and the key then removed. For certain of these vehicles, this happened only over a very small range of lever
movement when the lever was very close to the park position and appeared to be in park, when in fact it was not fully in
the park position. For other vehicles, this condition existed for about half of the range of lever movement between
park and reverse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For another set of vehicles, key removal without the transmission becoming locked in park only happened if one hand
was kept on the transmission lever while the key was removed with the other hand, since the transmission lever would
``spring'' into park if the hand holding it between the two positions was removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that, while it was not a compliance issue before September 1, 1993, in some cases the transmission
shift lever could be moved from the ``park'' position after the key was removed if the thumb button on the transmission
shift lever was kept depressed while the shift lever was moved to the ``park'' position and the key was removed. (For
a discussion of this issue, see October 21, 1992 interpretation letter to Transportation Research Center, Inc.,
which has been placed in the docket for this NPRM.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the problem of child-induced rollaway, the safety consequences of permitting these types of apparently
noncomplying systems are dependent on the likelihood that drivers would, in fact, remove the key in a manner that the
transmission would not be locked in park after such removal. If the existing requirement is complied with, removal
of the ignition key gives absolute assurance that the transmission is (or will become) locked in ``park'' and that
vehicle movement will not occur as a result of the shift lever being moved. If the proposed requirement is complied
with, removal of the ignition key while the transmission shift lever is fully placed in any designated shift position
would give the same assurance that the transmission is (or will become) locked in ``park,'' but the requirement would
no longer prohibit key removal in the circumstance when the lever is between detents. NHTSA is not aware of any specific
reported crashes that would be relevant to permitting these systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For some of the vehicles tested by the agency, deliberate action by the driver appears to be necessary in order to remove
the key without the transmission becoming locked in ``park.'' Such action is necessary where the driver must either
hold the shift lever between ``park'' and ``reverse'' with one hand while removing the key with the other hand, or keep
the thumb button depressed on the shift lever while removing the key. NHTSA tentatively concludes that there is no
basis to believe that drivers would deliberately make such efforts to defeat the transmission shift lock. Therefore,
the agency believes that permitting such systems would have no safety consequences, and that the existing requirement
is unnecessarily design-restrictive with respect to these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other of the vehicles tested by the agency, it is possible that a driver might inadvertently remove the key without
the transmission becoming locked in ``park.'' This could happen, for example, if the driver moved the lever so that
it appeared to be in ``park'' but was in fact short of the full ``park'' position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in order for such systems to result in any adverse safety consequences related to child-induced rollaway,
it would be necessary both for the driver to inadvertently fail to place the lever fully in the ``park'' position 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for a child to then play with the lever and/or the parking brake in a way that creates a rollaway. NHTSA believes that
either event would occur only very rarely and has tentatively concluded that the possibility of both events occurring
together is minuscule. Therefore, the agency does not believe that it is necessary to address this remote possibility
in a safety standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that its safety standards are intended to address unreasonable safety risks and not all conceivable risks
no matter how remote. The agency believes that its proposal is consistent with other actions that it has taken in this
area. For example, while NHTSA decided in the May 1990 final rule to require transmission shift locks for automatic
transmission vehicles, it also decided, based on a review of accident data, not to require such locks for manual transmission
vehicles. This did not mean that there was no conceivable risk of child-induced rollaways for manual transmission
vehicles, but instead that the risk was sufficiently small that the agency did not believe it was necessary to address
in a safety standard. Similarly, in June 1990, NHTSA denied a petition for rulemaking submitted by Mr. W. A. Barr requesting
that the agency issue requirements to address inadvertent vehicle movement associated with shifting automatic
transmissions into ``park,'' in part because of lack of evidence that the extent of the alleged problem was great enough
to warrant Federal intervention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is also proposing to amend the Purpose and Scope section of Standard No. 114 to clarify that the purpose of the
requirements at issue is to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from the rollaway of parked vehicles with automatic
transmissions as a result of children moving the shift mechanism out of the ``park'' position. That section currently
indicates that the purpose of the requirements is to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from rollaway of parked
vehicles.

NHTSA contemplates making the proposed amendments effective 30 days after publication of a final rule. The agency
tentatively concludes that there is good cause for such an effective date, since the amendments would impose no new
requirements but instead provide additional flexibility to manufacturers with no measurable impact on safety.

NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under either. As explained
above, the proposed amendments would impose no new requirements but instead provide additional flexibility to manufacturers,
with respect to transmission shift lock designs, with no measurable impact on safety. Also as stated above, the agency
estimates the annual consumer cost savings of adopting the proposed amendment to be a maximum of $6.75 to $14.00 per
affected vehicle. Accordingly, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

NHTSA has also considered the effects of this regulatory action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that this proposal, if adopted as a final rule, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The vehicle manufacturers affected by the proposed requirements would not typically qualify
as small businesses. Further, since no price changes should be associated with this proposal, small businesses,
small organizations and small governmental entities would not be affected in their capacity as purchasers of new
vehicles if this proposal were adopted in a final rule.

This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state
may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the
Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies
only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard specifies requirements primarily for theft protection to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting
from unauthorized operation of a motor vehicle. It also specifies requirements to reduce the incidence of crashes
resulting from the rollaway of parked vehicles with automatic transmissions as a result of children moving the shift
mechanism out of the ``park'' position.

S4.2.1(a) Except as provided in S4.2.2(a) and (b), the key-locking system required by S4.2 in each vehicle which has
an automatic transmission with a ``park'' position shall prevent removal of the key_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position other than
park, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of
removing the key, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in the park position, unless the transmission
and transmission shift mechanism are locked in park or become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the
key.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The following procedure is used for determining whether the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed
in a designated position. The lever or other shifting mechanism is moved to a designated position and physical contact
with the lever or other shifting mechanism is ended. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully
placed in the ``park'' position if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``park'' has been selected
and the vehicle will not roll away on a 10 percent grade when the parking brake is disengaged. The lever or other shifting
mechanism is considered to be fully placed in the ``neutral'' position if the ``neutral'' position is selected, the
transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``neutral'' has been selected, and activation of the accelerator
pedal does not cause the vehicle to move. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully placed in a
forward or reverse drive position if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that a drive position has been
selected and the vehicle can be driven under its own power. For purposes of S4.2.1, rollaway is movement of a vehicle
greater than 100 mm.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Act), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and the finding is
to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service is also required to promptly commence a status review of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Judge John C. Doerfler, representing the Williamson County Commissioners Court, submitted a petition to the Service
to delist six species of endangered karst invertebrates in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. The petition was
dated June 7, 1993, and received by the Service on that date. On June 16, 1993, the Service received a letter from attorney
J.B. Ruhl on behalf of the petitioners, clarifying the intent of the petition to incorporate recent taxonomic revisions
and the taxonomic reevaluation of five listed karst invertebrate species as seven species.

Several caves in Travis County contain more than one of the endangered karst invertebrates. These include Tooth Cave,
Amber Cave, Gallifer Cave, Kretschmarr Cave, and Kretschmarr Double Pit. These caves and others are protected under
the stewardship of the Texas System of Natural Laboratories (TSNL). In addition, some other caves are in preserves
regulated by the Cities of Austin and Georgetown. (For further discussion, see Factor D, ``The inadequacy of existing
regulatory mechanisms,'' below.) However, many of the caves containing endangered karst invertebrates currently
have no protection other than that provided by the Act.

The petitioners point out that, since publication of the final rule, new locations have been discovered for several
of the species, most notably the Tooth Cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman. The Tooth Cave ground beetle
was known from two caves about 2.5 kilometers (km) (1.5 miles (mi)) apart in Travis County, Texas, at the time of listing.
It is currently known from about 27 locations (24 confirmed, 3 tentative) along a 14-km (9-mi) distance in Travis and
Williamson counties, Texas. Only 10 of these caves are provided any degree of local protection (James Reddell, Texas
Memorial Museum,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Seven of these caves are located in the small TSNL preserves discussed above, one is in a small preserve owned
by the City of Austin, and two are in small preserves acquired as mitigation for a development project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bone Cave harvestman was not described at the time of the original listing, but was thought to be the same species
as the Bee Creek Cave harvestman. The Bone Cave harvestman is currently known from about 69 locations (60 confirmed,
9 tentative) along a 40-km (25-mi) distance in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. Of the 69 caves recorded as locations
of the Bone Cave harvestman, only 9 are provided any local protection. Three are TSNL caves, two are in City of Austin
preserves, two are in City of Georgetown preserves, and two were acquired as mitigation for a development project.
In addition, this species exhibits considerable geographical variation and loss of a significant number of locations
within a part of its range would result in a loss of genetic diversity within the species (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Few caves are provided any protection other than that now provided by the Act and their distribution is disjunct
and at the extremes of the species' range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of caves in which the other five endangered karst invertebrates have been found or tentatively identified
has increased slightly for three of the species, remained the same for another species (although its range has decreased),
and decreased for the fifth species.

The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, known at the time of listing from Tooth and Amber caves, within a 1.3-km (0.8-mi) radius
in Travis County, remains confirmed only from the two original caves. The species has been tentatively identified
from Stovepipe Cave and Kretschmarr Double Pit, lying within the original range. Stovepipe Cave is located on private
property that the City of Austin has approved for development. The three remaining caves are located in the small TSNL
preserves discussed above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tooth Cave spider, known at the time of listing only from Tooth Cave, is now also confirmed at New Comanche Trail
Cave and tentatively identified from Gallifer and Stovepipe caves, all lying along a 4.5-km (3-mi) distance in northwest
Travis County, Texas. Tooth and Gallifer caves lie within small TSNL preserves, Stovepipe Cave is on private property
approved for development, and New Comanche Trail Cave is not protected and may be adversely impacted by a planned realignment
of New Comanche Trail Road.

The Coffin Cave mold beetle was not described at the time of listing, but was thought to belong to the same species as
the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle. The Coffin Cave mold beetle is currently confirmed from four caves and tentatively
identified from one cave, all occurring along a 17-km (10-mi) distance in Williamson County, Texas. Off Campus and
Sierra Vista caves are located in a small preserve surrounded by a subdivision; the adequacy of the preserve for long-term
protection of the species at those sites is uncertain. On Campus Cave lies on a high school campus. The status of the
type locality (Coffin Cave) is unknown; recent attempts to locate the species in Inner Space Cavern were unsuccessful
(Reddell,

The Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle was believed to occur in four caves in Travis and Williamson counties at the time of
listing and is currently known from four caves in Travis County. A specimen from Coffin Cave was redescribed as the
Coffin Cave mold beetle and a new location for the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle was discovered at Stovepipe Cave. The
range of the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle has consequently decreased since the original listing from a 45-km (28-mi)
distance in Travis and Williamson counties to a 2-km (1.2-mi) distance in Travis County. Stovepipe Cave lies within
a proposed subdivision and the other three locations for the species, Tooth, Amber, and Kretschmarr caves, lie within
small TSNL preserves.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bee Creek Cave harvestman was believed to occur in five caves in Travis and Williamson counties at the time of listing.
It is currently confirmed at four caves and tentatively identified from two caves. The distribution of the Bee Creek
Cave harvestman consists of two disjunct areas, one about 5 km (3 mi) long and the other about 8 km (5 mi) in length, with
a distance of about 28 km (17 mi) between the northernmost and southernmost localities, all of which lie in Travis County.
Little Bee Creek Cave, Jester Estates Cave, and Kretschmarr Double Pit (a TSNL cave) are located in small preserve
areas. Bandit Cave is maintained as a small preserve, although attempts to relocate the Bee Creek Cave harvestman
in the cave in 1966, 1988, and 1989 were unsuccessful (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Cave Y is located in a proposed development area; the species' status in Bee Creek Cave is unknown since it has
not been possible to obtain permission to inspect the cave since 1975 (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of these invertebrates are known to occur in large numbers (William Elliott, Texas Memorial Museum, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and pers. comm., 1993). The fact that several of the species are known to occur at several dozen locations should not
be interpreted to mean that those species are abundant. (See Factor A, ``The present or threatened destruction, modification,
or curtailment of its habitat or range,'' below).

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(1) of the Act and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 424) set forth the procedures for adding species
to or removing species from the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species
due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the seven
karst invertebrates are re-evaluated in light of new information available to the Service and information presented
in the petition and are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service determined that the primary threat to these species comes from loss of habitat due to ongoing and proposed
development activities (final rule). The proximity of the caves inhabited by these species to the City of Austin makes
them vulnerable to continuing expansion of the Austin metropolitan area. Threats to specific caves occupied by these
species were addressed in the final rule (53 FR 36029). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The known ranges of the Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, the Tooth Cave spider, the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, the Coffin
Cave mold beetle, and the Bee Creek Cave harvestman have not appreciably increased since the original listing. Although
the range and number of known locations for the Tooth Cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman have increased
since the original listing, the degree of threat of habitat destruction or modification remains significant, and
may have increased, throughout the range of each species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Searches for karst features and karst fauna surveys have become more frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the listing, as developers and landowners have sought to comply with the Act. Many of the new locations of these
karst invertebrates have been discovered as a result of biological surveys conducted prior to development or sale
of land; consequently, newly discovered locations are frequently threatened by habitat destruction and other threats
associated with development. The recent revitalization of the real estate market in the Austin metropolitan area
has maintained and intensified the threat of karst invertebrate habitat destruction and other associated threats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners present a list of caves with endangered species that have been subject to some degree of disturbance.
They cite these cases as demonstrating that activities such as dumping, vandalism, and sealing of cave entrances
do not actually threaten the karst invertebrates. Reddell (in litt., 1993) counters that, in most of these cases,
the disturbance to the cave environment is recent in origin, minor in scale, and/or generally restricted to the immediate
entrance zone. The Service concurs with Reddell and believes that these examples do not present convincing evidence
that dumping, vandalism, and sealing entrances are harmless to the karst invertebrates. In most cases, not enough
time has elapsed since the disturbance to detect an effect on the karst invertebrates. The Service agrees with the
petitioners that there is little quantitative data available on the direct effects of trash dumping, vandalism,
sealing, and other disturbances on the karst invertebrates. However, there is substantial qualitative evidence
indicating that the threats to the karst invertebrates discussed in the final rule and in this finding are real, significant,
and ongoing. Reddell (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of karst invertebrates in affected areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioners cite the work of Crawford (1981) and Veni (1992) as evidence that the caves where the karst invertebrates
occur are not isolated ``islands'' of special habitat and that the invertebrates likely occur and move throughout
the karst in the interstitial spaces. In this interpretation, the petitioners misunderstand the Service's use of
the ``island'' analogy in the final rule. The final rule listing the karst invertebrates stated that the caves containing
the karst invertebrates ``occur in isolated `islands' '' of the Edwards limestone formation that were separated
from one another when stream channels cut through overlying limestone to lower rock layers'' (53 FR 36029). The Service
applied the island analogy to the distinct, geologically isolated karst areas (referred to in the Draft Recovery
Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) and hereinafter as ``regions'') within which the caves containing the
karst invertebrates have formed, not to the individual cave systems. Veni's work (1992) delineates these karst regions
and identifies areas ``having a high probability of suitable habitat for endangered or other endemic invertebrate
cave fauna.'' A letter from Veni in response to the petition clarifies that he did not intend that his work be interpreted
to mean that there are thousands of acres of habitat suitable for the karst invertebrates (George Veni, Veni and Associates,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Service believes that the karst invertebrates are likely to use interstitial spaces in the karst, particularly
in areas with some surface nutrient input to the karst system, the Service does not believe that this suitable habitat
exists uniformly within the larger karst regions (as delineated by Veni (1992) and described by the Service in the
final rule as ``islands''). Finally, Crawford (1981) focuses on aquatic karst species. In the aquatic karst ecosystems
upon which Crawford based his ideas, continuously flowing water through caves and the interstitium may provide more
continuous habitat for aquatic subterranean species and thus provide more opportunity for aquatic invertebrates
to inhabit interstitial spaces. Given that the Travis and Williamson County karst invertebrates are exclusively
terrestrial and that habitat for terrestrial species is more patchy and distributed according to the occurrence
of food, cover, and moisture, Crawford's ideas may not apply to these invertebrates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners cite the work of Curl (1966), Juberthei and Delay (1981), and Culver (1986) as evidence that most caves
have no entrance, that caves are rare even in karst areas, and that caves may be less favorable environments for karst
invertebrates than interstitial spaces. They cite these papers as evidence that habitat for terrestrial troglobites
(obligate cave-dwelling species) is ubiquitous in karst areas and that the Texas karst invertebrates exist throughout
the karst even where there are no caves or openings to the surface. Culver (1986) says that ``the number of caves (defined
as cavities large enough for human access) more or less corresponds to the number of habitable patches for terrestrial
troglobites.'' Reddell (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) and Peck (1976) believe that cave entrances provide an important avenue of nutrient input for cave fauna. Reddell
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) also cites several examples in which sub-surface voids having no natural entrance were encountered during
construction activities and found not to contain karst invertebrates. Similarly, clay-filled sinkholes with no
openings to the surface rarely contain karst invertebrates, whereas caves and sinkholes that are sealed to human
access by soil or rock fill or with openings to the surface that allow access by cave crickets or small mammals (and associated
nutrients) more often contain karst fauna (Reddell,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No threat from overutilization of these species is known to exist at this time. Collection for scientific or educational
purposes could become a threat if specific localities become widely known.

C. Disease or Predation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time of listing, predation by and competition with non-native species introduced in association with human
habitation was considered a potential threat to the karst invertebrates. Human activities facilitate movement
of non-native competitors and predators such as sowbugs, cockroaches, and fire ants into an area. Buildings, lawns,
roadways, and landscaped areas provide habitat from which these species can disperse. The relative accessibility
of the shallow caves in Travis and Williamson counties makes them especially vulnerable to invasion by non-native
species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fire ants are a major threat to the karst invertebrates. The significance of this threat and the difficulty of controlling
fire ants should not be underestimated. Fire ants are voracious predators and there is evidence that overall arthropod
diversity drops in their presence (Vinson and Sorensen 1986, Porter and Savignano 1990). Reddell (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) lists at least nine cave-inhabiting species that he has observed being preyed upon by fire ants. Elliott (1992)
cites other examples and notes that fire ant activity has increased dramatically in Central Texas since 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the threat posed by fire ants was not recognized at the time these species were listed, the magnitude of the
threat the ants pose has subsequently become quite apparent. Even in the unlikely event that fire ants do not prey upon
the listed species, their presence in and around caves could have a drastic detrimental effect on the cave ecosystem
through loss of species, inside the cave and out, that provide nutrient input and critical links in the food chain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Controlling fire ants once they have invaded the cave and vicinity is difficult. Chemical control methods have some
effectiveness but the effect of these agents on non-target species is unclear. Consequently, using chemicals to
control fire ants in and near caves is not advisable. Currently, the Service recommends only boiling water treatment
for control of fire ant colonies near caves inhabited by listed invertebrates. This method is labor-intensive and
only moderately effective. Presently, the burden of carrying out such practices is not a designated or mandated duty
of any agency, individual, or organization. This type of control will likely be needed indefinitely or until a long-term
method of fire ant control is developed.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Invertebrates are not included on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's list of threatened and endangered species
and are provided no protection by the State; nor do the Department regulations contain provisions for protecting
habitat of any listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, some of the caves containing endangered invertebrates are in TSNL and city preserves. A
small preserve surrounds the entrance to each of these caves. However, these preserves encompass only a fraction
of the surface drainage area that provides input of nutrients and moisture into the caves. The entire surface and subsurface
drainage area is the minimum area believed necessary to provide adequate long-term protection for cave ecosystems.
The preserves around these caves are not sufficient to counter nutrient depletion and prevent pollution, should
the surrounding areas be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the TSNL caves are under temporary deed to TSNL and may be sold at the owner's discretion (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1993). In addition, City of Austin cave protection laws do not apply in most cases, since the great majority
of these caves lie outside the city limits.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is unaware of other threats to these species beyond those discussed under factors A&hyph;D (above). As
noted under Factor A, the Bone Cave harvestman exhibits considerable geographical variation. Loss of a number of
locations within any one part of its range would result in a loss of genetic diversity for the species (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). The Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion, Tooth Cave spider, Coffin Cave and Kretschmarr Cave mold beetles, and Bee
Creek Cave harvestman are each known from fewer than 10 locations (4, 4, 5, 4, and 6 locations respectively, including
unconfirmed identifications). Therefore, the loss of even a single location would represent a significant loss
of genetic diversity for any of those species. Lack of genetic diversity can accelerate the decline or extinction
of rare species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the final rule, these species remain extremely vulnerable to losses. For the Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion,
the Tooth Cave spider, the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle, the Coffin Cave mold beetle, and the Bee Creek Cave harvestman,
neither the range nor the number of confirmed localities within the range has expanded significantly since the original
listing. The Tooth cave ground beetle and the Bone Cave harvestman occur in more locations and are more widespread
than was originally believed, but the expansion of the overall range is not significant and the majority of caves in
which these species occur are subject to one or more of the threats discussed above (Reddell, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recently released a Draft Recovery Plan for the karst invertebrates (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993).
That document details recovery actions and criteria that, when met, may result in reclassification or delisting
of the endangered karst invertebrates. Continued efforts to locate new inhabited caves, to implement habitat conservation
measures, and to control the threat of fire ants could bring the karst invertebrates to the point where protection
under the Act is no longer necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the information presented in the petition, as well as the best and most current
scientific and commercial information, in determining that the petition does not present substantial scientific
and commercial information indicating that delisting of any of the seven karst invertebrates may be warranted. These
species continue to require the protection provided by the Act because of their extremely small, vulnerable, and
limited habitats located within an area that is experiencing continued pressures from economic and population growth.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) herein proposes to amend the Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program
(Program) regulations. The Service plans to add Texas and Maryland (beginning with the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season)
to the list of participating States, and to implement some additional modifications to the Program. This regulatory
action will require that licensed hunters in all participating States have evidence of current participation in
the Program on their person while hunting migratory game birds. The quality and extent of information about harvests
of migratory game birds must be improved in order to better manage these populations. Hunters' names and addresses
are necessary to provide a sampling frame for a voluntary hunter survey to improve harvest estimates for all migratory
game birds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this rule is to expand the Harvest Information Program (Program) to include the States of Texas and Maryland
beginning in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, and to make minor modifications to the Program. One such modification
is proposed to limit the requirement for participation to only State-licensed migratory bird hunters. Another modification
would require compliance with the Program in each State in which an individual hunts migratory game birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of intent to establish the Program was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 24, 1991. The proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 10, 1992. State wildlife agencies expressed a number of concerns in response to the proposed rule. The majority
of comments were positive and constructive in nature. However, many States were severely disappointed that the sole
remaining option placed the major cost burden on the State wildlife agency. The identification of licensed migratory
bird hunters and the collection of names, addresses and other information from them would be the State's responsibility
and represents the major portion of the cost burden; while conduct of the harvest survey would be a Federal responsibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many States would have preferred the opportunity of using a separate Federal permit card. A State/Federal technical
working group is continuing to develop procedures that would improve harvest estimates without placing unnecessary
burdens on State agencies, license vendors or the hunters. Alternative survey designs continue to be investigated.
Specifically, alternative survey methods for special groups of unlicensed hunters (e.g., junior and senior hunters)
are being investigated to determine if any resulting biases in the estimates would compromise the quality of the survey
and if other procedures could be developed that would conform to accepted statistical standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 19, 1993. The effect of that final rule was to establish the Program and implement the pilot phase in three States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of Pilot Phase
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State wildlife agencies and the Service began implementing and studying the Program in 1992 with a 2&hyph;year pilot
phase in three volunteer States (California, Missouri, and South Dakota). These States are providing the names and
addresses of migratory bird hunters and other necessary information, from which the Service is conducting a national
Migratory Bird Harvest Survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pilot phase of the Program is being preliminarily evaluated to determine the adequacy and timeliness of the sample
and the time burden, cost, and other impacts on hunters, State license agents, State wildlife agencies, and the Service.
The approaches used in different States are being compared for costs, efficiency, convenience and survey performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service previously stated that after evaluation in 1994 of this pilot phase and consideration of any proposed
changes, other States will be phased into the Program until all States will participate in 1998. The suggested schedule
was published in the June 10, 1992, proposed rule. Consistent with that schedule, Texas will participate in the Program
beginning in 1994. Maryland has requested to participate in the Program earlier than scheduled. Revision of the implementation
schedule is being proposed in this rulemaking document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of Program (1992&hyph;1994)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, all migratory game bird hunters in participating States are required to have a Program validation indicating
that they have provided their names and addresses to the State wildlife agency. Validations are printed on their annual
State hunting license or supplementary permit. The State may charge hunters a small handling fee to compensate agents
and to cover the State's administrative costs associated with conducting this Program. Individual migratory bird
hunters are not required to obtain evidence of Program participation in more than one State per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The names, current addresses, and necessary information for an adequate sample of migratory bird hunters are needed
in time for hunting-record forms to be distributed to selected hunters before they forget the details of their hunts.
Because of this fundamental need, States have only a short time to obtain hunter names and addresses from license vendors
and to provide those names and addresses to the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Modifications to the Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to implementation of the Program in Texas and Maryland, the Service is proposing several other modifications
to the Program. One such modification would require persons who hunt migratory game birds in more than one State to
identify themselves as migratory game bird hunters and provide their names, addresses, and dates of birth to each
State in which they hunt migratory game birds. Currently, individual hunters are not required to participate in more
than one State per year; however, hunters must still adhere to the licensing requirements of all individual States
in which they hunt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another modification being proposed is to exempt hunters from a permit requirement if they are also exempt from State-licensing
requirements. This would include several categories of hunters such as junior hunters, senior hunters, landowners,
and other special categories. These exemptions vary on a State-by-State basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excluding those hunters who are not required to obtain an annual State hunting license from the Program also excludes
their harvest from the estimates. The importance of their harvest depends on how many hunters are excluded and on the
number of birds they bag. Excluding these hunters may result in serious bias. Therefore, the Service is currently
evaluating the effects of excluding these hunters and would appreciate any information that may be available. Minimum
survey standards are also being developed for exempt categories. One suggestion is to allow a class of hunters to be
excluded from participating in the Program if 1) it is periodically demonstrated that only minimal bias in the estimates
results from their exclusion or 2) a statistically sound alternate sampling procedure is implemented. States entering
the program will individually address the effects of exempting unlicensed hunters through a cooperative agreement
with the Service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 14, 1991, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks concluded that the rule would not have a significant
effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 USC 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule will eventually affect about 3&hyph;5 million migratory game bird hunters when it is fully implemented.
It will require licensed migratory game bird hunters to identify themselves and to supply their names, addresses,
and birth dates. Additional information will be requested in order that they can be efficiently sampled for a voluntary
national harvest survey. Hunters will be required to have evidence of current participation in the Program on their
person while hunting migratory game birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States may require a small handling fee to compensate their hunting-license vendors and to cover their administrative
costs. Many of the State hunting-license vendors are small entities, but this rule should not economically impact
those vendors. Only migratory game bird hunters, individuals, would be required to provide this information, so
this rule should not adversely affect small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0015. The information is required from licensed hunters to obtain the benefit
of hunting migratory game birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.015 hours per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate
or any other aspect of these reporting requirements should be directed to the Service Information Collection Clearance
Officer, ms 224_ARLSQ, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management

The regulations do not have significant federalism effects as provided in Executive Order 12612. Due to the migratory
nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act. State harvest surveys presently cannot provide adequate national estimates of migratory
game bird harvests for the following reasons: Some States do not now conduct annual harvest surveys or maintain accessible
lists of hunter names and addresses. Comparable information is not available from all States because States have
different licensing laws regulating who must buy a hunting license and different survey procedures. Currently,
many State license lists are not available in time to permit distribution of hunter records early in the hunting season.
Budget constraints often prevent States from conducting harvest surveys during certain years or could cause some
States to eliminate them completely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal
or State Governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, these regulations do not have significant
federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. In fact, the Service would cooperate with States in providing special surveys to meet mutual management
needs, and increased cooperation between Federal and State agencies would reduce duplication of survey efforts.

Executive Order 12360 discussed guidelines for the taking of individual property rights. These rules, authorized
by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, do not affect any constitutionally-protected property rights. These rules would
not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any
property.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a proposed rule to set forth agency policies and requirements and
to provide administrative procedures, information, and guidance for those sections of the Prescription Drug Marketing
Act of 1987 (PDMA), as modified by the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 (PDA), that were not implemented by the
final rule that set forth Federal guidelines for State licensing of wholesale drug distributors (55 FR 38012, September
14, 1990). FDA is also proposing to amend the definitions section of the State licensing guidelines to make the definition
of ``wholesale distribution'' consistent with that in this proposed regulation.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1988, the President signed PDMA into law (Pub. L. 100&hyph;293). According to the congressional findings
that were made part of the text of PDMA as section 2, the legislation was intended to ensure that drug products purchased
by consumers would be safe and effective and to avoid an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded,
subpotent, or expired drugs were being sold to American consumers. (See sec. 2(8), PDMA.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress found, among other things, that legislation was necessary because there were insufficient safeguards
in the drug distribution system to prevent the introduction and retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit
drugs, and that a wholesale drug diversion submarket had developed that prevented effective control over, or even
routine knowledge of, the true sources of drugs. (See secs. 2(2) and 2(3), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress found that large amounts of drugs had been reimported into the United States as American goods returned,
causing a health and safety risk to American consumers because the drugs may have become subpotent or adulterated
during foreign handling and shipping. Congress also found that a ready market for prescription drug reimports had
been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and had provided the cover for
the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs. (See sec. 2(4), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The congressional findings stated that the then-existing system of providing drug samples to physicians through
manufacturers' representatives had been abused for decades and had resulted in the sale to consumers of misbranded,
expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals. (See sec. 2(6), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the congressional findings, the bulk resale of below-wholesale-priced prescription drugs by health
care entities for ultimate sale at retail helped to fuel the diversion market and was an unfair form of competition
to wholesalers and retailers who had to pay otherwise prevailing market prices. (See sec. 2(7), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA amends sections 301, 303, 503, and 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 331, 333,
353, 381) to: (1) Ban the reimportation of prescription human drugs produced in the United States, except when reimported
by the manufacturer or under FDA authorization for emergency medical care; (2) ban the sale, purchase, or trade, or
the offer to sell, purchase, or trade, of any drug sample; (3) ban the sale, purchase, or trade, or the offer to sell,
purchase, or trade, or counterfeit any drug coupon; (4) establish limits on the distribution of drug samples to practitioners
licensed to prescribe such drugs or to pharmacies of hospitals or other health care entities, including a requirement
that such distributions occur only at the request of a licensed practitioner; (5) require licensed practitioners
to request samples in writing; (6) mandate storage, handling, and recordkeeping requirements for drug samples;
(7) prohibit, with certain exceptions, the sale, purchase, or trade, or the offer to sell, purchase, or trade, of prescription
human drugs that were purchased by hospitals or other health care entities, or which were donated or supplied at a reduced
price to a charitable organization; (8) require State licensing of wholesale distributors of prescription drugs
under Federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and recordkeeping; (9) require
unauthorized wholesale distributors to provide to each wholesale distributor a statement identifying each sale
of the drug before the sale to such wholesale distributor; and (10) set forth civil and criminal penalties for violations
of these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most PDMA provisions became effective July 22, 1988. However, the drug sample distribution requirements (section
503(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 353(d))) became effective on October 20, 1988, and the requirement for State licensure
of wholesale distributors (section 503(e)(2) of the act) became effective on September 15, 1992 (2 years after the
adoption of final rules by the agency setting standards for State licensing). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 13, 1988 (53 FR 35325), FDA published proposed State licensing guidelines to implement that part of PDMA.
FDA received approximately 50 comments on the proposal. These comments were made part of a public docket (Docket No.
88N&hyph;0258), which is available for inspection at FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above). After considering
all the comments received on the proposed rule, FDA published revised State licensing guidelines as a final rule (21
CFR part 205) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 14, 1990 (55 FR 38012). That rule includes minimum requirements for storage and handling of prescription
drugs and for establishment and maintenance of records of drug distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDMA State licensing requirements were modified by the enactment of PDA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;353, 106 Stat. 941)
on August 26, 1992. Among other things, PDA amended section 503(e) of the act to establish a temporary Federal wholesale
distributor registration procedure for wholesale drug distributors in those States that do not have a licensing
program that meets the Federal guidelines. On September 3, 1992, FDA issued a letter to industry and other interested
persons providing information and guidance on the procedure to be followed by wholesale distributors required to
register under the procedure established by PDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDA also recast other parts of PDMA. Among other things, PDA: (1) Amended section 303(b)(1) of the act to establish
a scienter requirement (``knowingly'') for conviction of violations of certain prohibited acts under section 301(t)
of the act relating to reimportation (section 801(d)(1) of the act), samples (section 503(c)(1) of the act), coupons
(503(c)(2) of the act), and unlicensed wholesale distributors (section 503(e)(2)(A) of the act); (2) amended section
503(d) of the act to prohibit the distribution of drug samples by anyone other than the manufacturer or authorized
distributors of record, except that Congress excluded from the term ``distribute'' the provision of a drug sample
to a patient by a licensed practitioner, health care professional acting at the direction and under the supervision
of such a practitioner, and a hospital or health care entity pharmacy acting at the direction of such a practitioner;
(3) amended section 503(d)(2) and (d)(3) of the act to disallow any distribution of drug samples by unauthorized distributors;
(4) amended section 503(e)(1) of the act to require that unauthorized distributors provide a statement of origin
identifying all prior sales, purchases, or trades of such drugs and the names and addresses of the parties to the transactions
to all recipients; and (5) made certain conforming and technical changes to the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 1 and November 3, 1988, and January 26, 1990, FDA issued letters to the regulated industry and other interested
persons providing information and guidance on those aspects of PDMA that were not implemented by the State licensing
rule. The letters requested suggestions from the public regarding the drafting of regulations. Suggestions from
the public have been made part of a public docket (Docket No. 88N&hyph;258L), which is also available for inspection
at FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above). The agency has received requests for the issuance of further
guidance letters to provide specific information in certain areas or to answer particular questions. However, FDA
believes that it is now appropriate to establish definitive requirements through notice and comment rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In drafting this proposed rule, the agency considered the comments submitted to Docket Nos. 88N&hyph;0258 and 88N&hyph;258L,
including suggestions received in response to FDA's three guidance letters, pertinent comments received in response
to the proposed rule on State licensing of wholesale distributors, and other written submissions.

II. Description of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to add a new part 203 to set forth agency policies and requirements and to provide administrative procedures,
information, and guidance for those sections of PDMA that were not implemented by part 205. FDA is also proposing to
amend &sect;205.3 to make the definition of ``wholesale distribution'' consistent with that in proposed part 203.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the provisions of proposed part 203 follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It was intended that PDMA would protect the public against the threat of subpotent, adulterated, counterfeit, and
misbranded drugs posed by the existence of drug diversion schemes and a drug diversion submarket, and the absence
of appropriate controls over and creation and maintenance of appropriate records regarding the distribution of
prescription drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the scope of the proposed rule, as set forth in proposed &sect;203.1, includes establishment of procedures
and requirements pertaining to the reimportation and wholesale distribution of prescription drugs; the sale, purchase,
or trade (or the offer to sell, purchase, or trade) of prescription drugs by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable
institutions; and the distribution of prescription drug samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Bulk Drugs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some questions have been raised about the applicability of PDMA to bulk drugs. The statutory language of PDMA encompasses
all drugs subject to section 503(b) of the act within its scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history (``Report of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,'' H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, April 30, 1987,
and ``Report of the Committee on Finance,'' S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, March 18, 1988) or the congressional hearing record
do not suggest that bulk drug substances be treated any differently from other prescription drugs. Bulk drug substances
are susceptible to the same problems of lack of accountability and diversion that this legislation was intended to
remedy. It is clear that applying the provisions of the statute to bulk drug substances would help protect against
the abuses that Congress intended to address and contribute to the protection of the public health. Accordingly,
bulk drug substances are, as drugs within the meaning of section 503(b) of the act, expressly brought within the scope
of PDMA and these implementing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Biological Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have also been raised about the applicability of PDMA to biological products, even though the statutory
language of PDMA encompasses all drugs subject to section 503(b) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is nothing in the legislative history or the congressional hearing record to suggest that biological products
that are prescription drugs under section 503(b) of the act should be treated differently from other prescription
drugs. Biological products, except for blood and blood components intended for transfusion, are susceptible to
the same problems of lack of accountability and diversion that this legislation was intended to remedy. It is clear
that applying the provisions of the statute to biological products, except for blood and blood components intended
for transfusion, or biological products which are also medical devices, would help protect against the abuses that
Congress intended to address and contribute to the protection of the public health. Accordingly, biological products
that are prescription drugs under section 503(b) of the act, except for blood and blood components intended for transfusion,
fall under the scope of PDMA and are expressly included in these implementing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since passage of PDMA, a number of persons have presented to FDA issues posed by the application of PDMA to the distribution
and sale of blood and blood components intended for transfusion by blood establishments and hospitals. Two comments
to the agency requested clarification of PDMA's scope and urged FDA to exempt blood establishments from all of PDMA's
provisions. The comments contended that licensing blood distributors as wholesalers would seriously disrupt the
Nation's blood services. A third comment suggested that the agency could, by notice and comment rulemaking, exempt
blood and blood components from PDMA by declaring that they are not prescription drugs for PDMA purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA, by its literal terms, applies to all drugs that are subject to section 503(b) of the act; that is, to all human prescription
drugs, including biological products. There is no doubt that blood and blood components intended for transfusion
are prescription drugs. (See 21 CFR 606.121(c)(8)(i) and 610.61(s). See also 47 FR 22518, May 25, 1982; 46 FR 40212,
August 7, 1981.) However, if PDMA were considered applicable to the distribution of blood and blood components, the
result would be to impede the existing blood distribution system, thereby interfering with our Nation's blood supply.
Because application of PDMA to blood and blood components would produce this untenable result, FDA believes that
Congress could not have intended to subject blood and blood components to PDMA's provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the legislative history lacks any discussion of PDMA's application to blood and blood components and also
clearly shows that Congress intended that PDMA remedy problems associated with the distribution of those drugs that
are popularly referred to as ``medicines'' or ``pharmaceuticals.'' (See Pub. L. 100&hyph;293, sec. 2 (1988) (``Report
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,'' H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, April 30, 1987, and ``Report of the Committee on Finance,''
S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, March 18, 1988).) Blood and blood components are unique drug products that are distributed
in an entirely different way from other prescription drugs. FDA believes that the fact that blood and blood components
are not part of the system of distribution and marketing that Congress intended to regulate under the terms of PDMA
further signals that Congress could not have intended to include blood and blood components within the scope of the
licensing requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FDA has taken a number of actions to clarify the scope of PDMA to prescription drugs other than blood and
blood components intended for transfusion. In the final State licensing guideline rule (55 FR 38012 at 38024), FDA
specifically excluded from the definition of ``wholesale distribution'' the sale, purchase, or trade of blood and
blood components intended for transfusion (see &sect;205.3(f)(8)). At the same time, FDA published another proposed
rule, ``Applicability to Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion; Guidelines for State Licensing of
Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors'' (55 FR 38027, September 14, 1990), asking for comments on the exclusion
of blood and blood components intended for transfusion from the PDMA State licensing guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments received and reviewing PDMA's purpose and its legislative history, FDA has tentatively
concluded that PDMA is not intended to apply to blood and blood components intended for transfusion. Accordingly,
at &sect;203.1 the proposed rule would exclude blood and blood components intended for transfusion from the requirements
of and the restrictions in PDMA and also adds specific language at &sect;203.22(g) excluding blood and blood components
intended for transfusion from the PDMA sales restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Oxygen
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have also been raised about the applicability of PDMA to the drug oxygen, U.S.P. (U.S. Pharmacopeia). FDA
advises that oxygen, U.S.P., is a prescription drug subject to section 503(b) of the act, and, therefore, within the
scope of PDMA and these proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Reimportation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 801(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(d)) provides that a prescription drug that is manufactured in a State and exported
may not be reimported into the United States unless it is imported by the manufacturer, except when authorized by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services for emergency medical care. The delegation of authority provisions at 21 CFR
5.10 redelegate the functions of the Secretary to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 801(d) of the act responds to a finding that large amounts of drugs were being reimported into the United States
as ``American Goods Returned,'' and that these imports posed a health and safety risk to American consumers because
they could become subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling and shipping. (See sec. 2(4), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The congressional findings also acknowledged that what was termed ``the ready market for prescription drug reimports''
was ``the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and has provided the cover for
the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.'' (See sec. 2(5), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Restrictions on Reimportation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.10 sets forth the restriction that no prescription drug manufactured in a State and exported
from the United States may be reimported by anyone other than its manufacturer, except that FDA may grant permission
to a person other than the manufacturer to reimport a prescription drug if it deems such reimportation is required
for emergency medical care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Defining ``Manufacturer''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA defined the term ``manufacturer'' in the PDMA State licensing regulation to mean anyone engaged in manufacturing,
preparing, propagating, compounding, processing, packaging, repackaging, or labeling of a prescription drug
(&sect;205.3(d)). This definition is somewhat more inclusive than the definition used earlier by the agency in the
labeling provisions at &sect;201.1 (21 CFR 201.1). The definition in &sect;201.1(b) states that the manufacturer
is the person who performs all of the following operations that are required to produce the product: (1) Mixing, (2)
granulating, (3) milling, (4) molding, (5) lyophilizing, (6) tableting, (7) encapsulating, (8) coating, (9) sterilizing,
and (10) filling sterile, aerosol, or gaseous drugs into dispensing containers; or at least some of the operations
if the labeling indicates the presence of other manufacturers. Under &sect;201.1, a packer or distributor is not
the same as a manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA concluded that the more inclusive definition of ``manufacturer'' was consistent with the intent of the statute
in imposing the requirement for State licensing of wholesale drug distributors; however, the agency has preliminarily
concluded that a less inclusive definition of that term would be more consistent with the intent of the remaining sections
of PDMA. For example, the statutory provision against reimportation by persons other than the manufacturer (except
when permission is granted by FDA) is intended to establish accountability in reimportations so that adulterated
and/or misbranded goods do not reenter commercial channels in the United States. The reimportation provision is
based on the assumption that a manufacturer, in the less inclusive sense, is the person most knowledgeable about the
product's characteristics; is the most capable of determining that the product meets the stability, quality, and
purity standards it is represented to possess; and is the only person capable of authenticating the basic integrity
of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining sections of PDMA are consistent with the less inclusive definition of ``manufacturer'' in &sect;201.1,
rather than the more inclusive definition in &sect;205.3(d). Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.3(p) proposes to
adopt the definition of ``manufacturer'' in &sect;201.1 for this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applications for Reimportation to Provide Emergency Medical Care
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.11 provides an administrative procedure by which applications may be made by a person other than
the manufacturer for the reimportation of prescription drugs for emergency medical care. The proposal would codify
the current procedure whereby applications for reimportation are submitted to the Director of the FDA District Office
in the district where reimportation is sought. The District Office would review and approve or disapprove each application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. An Appeal From an Adverse Decision by the District Office
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.12 would also codify the current procedure that permits an appeal from an adverse decision by
the district office to be made to the Office of Compliance (HFD&hyph;300), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,
for prescription human drugs other than biological products. An appeal from an adverse decision involving human
prescription biological products is to be made to the Office of Compliance (HFM&hyph;600), Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Sales Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(c)(3) of the act prohibits, with certain exceptions, the sale, purchase, or trade (or any offer to sell,
purchase, or trade) of any prescription drug that was purchased by a public or private hospital or other health care
entity, or donated or supplied at a reduced price to a charitable organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Defining ``Charitable Organization''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code generally exempts from income taxes not-for-profit organizations
that operate for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, and public safety purposes. However,
such exemptions are not automatic. Under 26 CFR 1.501, a charitable organization must apply for and be granted tax-exempt
status. Tax-exempt status may be revoked and the organization may lose its exemption if it fails to meet the requirements
of the statute and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is FDA's view that an organization can be accurately described as one fitting the requirements of section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code only if it has been granted tax-exempt status by the Department of the Treasury. Accordingly,
FDA proposes to define the term ``charitable organization'' in proposed &sect;203.3(f) as a nonprofit hospital,
health care entity, organization, institution, foundation, association, or corporation that has been granted
an exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Restrictions and Exclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.20 restates the statutory restrictions on prescription drug sales by hospitals, health care
entities, and charitable institutions (section 503(c)(3) of the act). These restrictions reflect a congressional
finding that the resale of prescription drugs by health care entities at below wholesale prices had helped to fuel
the drug diversion market and that such sales constituted an unfair form of competition to legitimate wholesalers
and retailers paying the prevailing market prices. (See sec. 2(7), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not distinguish sales made at the average wholesale price (AWP) and those made at below AWP or at more
than the AWP. The sales restrictions apply to all sales, purchases, or trades by hospitals, health care entities,
and charitable institutions. Sales of any human prescription drugs purchased by a hospital or other health care entity,
or donated or supplied at reduced cost to a charitable institution, are prohibited unless excepted by section 503(c)(3)(B)
of the act or exempted under proposed &sect;&sect;203.22, 203.23, or 203.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its findings, Congress stated that it believed that these resales had helped to create an unacceptable risk that
counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs would be sold to American consumers. (See sec.
2(8), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution cannot be wholesaler
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA has learned that some hospitals and health care entities, including physicians, have obtained licenses as wholesale
distributors in an effort to circumvent the statutory restrictions against the sale of prescription drugs by hospitals,
health care entities, and charitable institutions. Those hospitals and health care entities that have secured wholesale
drug distributor licenses claim that the statutory restrictions are made inapplicable to them by the first clause
of the last sentence of section 503(c)(3) of the act, which reads: ``For purposes of this paragraph, the term `entity'
does not include a wholesale distributor of drugs or a retail pharmacy licensed under State law * * *.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a reading is inconsistent not only with general rules of statutory construction, but with the intent of Congress
as reflected in the legislative history. The legislative history, which addresses Congress' concern about donations
to charitable institutions and institutional discounts for hospitals and health care entities, notes that some
of these institutions had been sources of unfair competition and drug diversion, and explains that the statutory
prohibition against the sale of drugs donated to or acquired at reduced price by charitable institutions or purchased
by hospitals or health care entities is directed at preventing unfair profits through resales of such drugs. Congress
said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(c)(3) would prohibit resales of pharmaceuticals by hospitals and other health care entities or charitable
organizations with certain exceptions. This provision is intended to cover resales by both for profit and nonprofit
health care entities. These institutions typically receive discount prices, substantially below the average wholesale
price (AWP) for pharmaceuticals, based on their status as a health care entity or charity. When hospitals or other
health care entities obtain pharmaceuticals at favorable prices and then resell those drugs at a profit, they are
unfairly competing with wholesalers and retailers who cannot obtain such a favorable price. Such resales defraud
manufacturers, who are led to believe that the drugs are for the use of the health care entity. In any case, these resales
reward the unscrupulous and penalize the otherwise honest and efficient wholesaler or retailer while fueling the
diversion market. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, pp. 12&hyph;13.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA interprets the first clause of the last sentence of section 503(c)(3) of the act to mean that the general prohibition
against drug sales by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions was not intended to interfere
with the operations of legitimate licensed prescription drug wholesalers and retail pharmacies. Section 503(c)(3)
of the act does not open up a loophole for a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution to avoid the statutory
prohibition against drug sales simply by obtaining a wholesaler license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.3(n) would state that a person cannot simultaneously be a ``health care entity''
and a retail pharmacy or wholesale distributor. The agency is also proposing to amend the State licensing guidelines
by adopting the same definition for ``health care entity'' at &sect;205.3(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a charitable institution or a for-profit or nonprofit hospital or health care entity has a corporate for-profit
subsidiary that is a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, or if it is part of a group in which there is common control
over the hospital or health care entity and a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, then the charitable institution,
hospital, or health care entity would be prohibited under section 503(c)(3) of the act and proposed &sect;&sect;203.20
and 203.22 from transferring any prescription drug donated or supplied at reduced price to the charitable institution
or purchased by the hospital or health care entity to the related wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy for further
sale except for a sale under a valid prescription or for emergency medical reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A charitable institution, hospital, or health care entity that has a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy subsidiary,
or one that is part of a group in which there is common control over the charitable institution, hospital, or health
care entity and a wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, should maintain books and records that provide sufficient
audit trails to trace the purchase and sale of prescription drugs to ensure that no prescription drug donated or supplied
at reduced price to the charitable institution or purchased by the hospital or health care entity is transferred to
a related wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy for further sale except for a sale under a valid prescription or
for emergency medical reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statutory exclusions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed &sect;203.22 restates the statutory exclusions to the sales restrictions. They are: (1) The purchase
or other acquisition of a drug for its own use by a hospital or other health care entity that is a member of a group purchasing
organization from the group purchasing organization or from other hospitals or health care entities that are members
of the organization; (2) the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug by a charitable
organization to a nonprofit affiliate of the organization to the extent otherwise permitted by law; (3) the sale,
purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug among hospitals or other health care entities
that are under common control; (4) the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug
for emergency medical reasons; or (5) the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug, an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug,
or the dispensing of a drug under a valid prescription.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Common control
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One statutory exclusion to the general prohibition against resale of drugs by hospitals, health care entities,
and charitable institutions permits the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs among hospitals and health
care entities that are under common control. There is no statutory definition of the term ``common control,'' nor
is the term mentioned in the legislative history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concept of common control can be found in other Federal regulatory schemes that were in use at the time PDMA was enacted
into law. Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency define ``common control''
to mean possession of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person or an organization,
whether by ownership of stock, voting securities or rights, contract, or otherwise. (See 17 CFR 230.405 and 40 CFR
66.3(f).) FDA included this definition in the State licensing guidelines at &sect;205.3(f)(4). This proposal would
adopt the same definition in proposed &sect;203.3(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sales for emergency medical reasons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 503(c)(3) of the act permits the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by a hospital, health care
entity, or charitable institution for emergency medical reasons. The statute states that ``emergency medical reasons''
includes transfers of a drug between health care entities or from a health care entity to a retail pharmacy undertaken
to alleviate temporary shortages of the drug arising from delays in or interruptions of regular distribution schedules.
The statute does not further elaborate on the term ``emergency medical reasons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that it may be useful to specify some of the circumstances in which a sale for emergency medical reasons
would be allowed. (See proposed &sect;203.3(k).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received a significant number of comments from providers of emergency care, including emergency medical services,
ambulance corporations, fire companies, rescue squads, urgent care providers, emergency care physicians and technicians,
and State emergency care agencies and commissions that advised the agency that hospital pharmacies have traditionally
supplied drugs for emergency use by emergency medical services and licensed practitioners' offices operating in
the general service area of the hospital. Several comments stated that wholesale distributors are reluctant to open
small accounts to provide such drugs for emergency care, and that nearby hospital pharmacies are the logical providers.
Moreover, the comments noted that many States encourage hospitals to supply drugs for emergency use to emergency
medical services, and some States require emergency services to acquire their drugs exclusively from hospitals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow sale of drugs by a hospital or health care entity to nearby emergency medical services such
as ambulance services, rescue squads, and fire companies in the same State or service or marketing area for use in emergency
treatment and to licensed practitioners for emergency office treatment. The proposal would also define emergency
medical reasons to allow hospitals and health care entities to provide minimal emergency supplies to nursing homes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, FDA believes that the exception for emergency medical reasons does not permit hospitals or health care
entities regularly to sell to licensed practitioners prescription drugs that will be used for routine office procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government hospitals and health care entities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed &sect;203.22(f) would also exclude the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by Federal, State,
and local government hospitals and health care entities to other Federal, State, and local government hospitals
or health care entities from the general prohibition against the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by
a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress has established an extensive system of public hospitals and health care entities. These include hospitals,
clinics, and dispensaries operated for the military by the Department of Defense; hospitals and clinics operated
by the Veterans' Administration; and hospitals and clinics operated by the U.S. Public Health Service (including
Indian Health Service hospitals and clinics).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, State and local governments have established public health hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries,
including drug treatment inpatient and outpatient facilities. These facilities operate under a variety of organizational
structures. They may be owned and operated by governmental entities, or be organized as private corporations or associations
under contract to State or local government agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These health care entities may have interagency arrangements for the purchase and exchange of prescription drugs.
Such facilities operate because of Federal, State, or local governmental commitments to provide health care to particular
classes of patients in response to specific client needs. Among these needs are the provision of services to people
with low incomes, the distribution of vaccines, and the dispensing of antitoxins and blood derivatives in public
health emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, the adoption of the prohibition against sales by hospitals or health care entities was prompted in part because
of the differential pricing structure that permits purchases by hospitals and health care entities at below wholesale
prices and the resultant temptation to resell drugs so acquired at a profit. However, there is no financial incentive
for a Federal, State, or local government hospital or health care entity to sell prescription drugs purchased at below
wholesale prices because any profit from such a sale would go to the Federal or State treasury. Accordingly, FDA believes
that there is little likelihood that permitting Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care entities
to sell prescription drugs to other Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care entities would
lead to the kinds of abuses that PDMA was designed to end.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, proposed &sect;203.22(f) would exclude such transactions from the general prohibition against resales
by hospitals and health care entities and thus permit Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care
entities to sell drugs to other Federal, State, or local government hospitals and health care entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has been asked whether a State or local government agency, which, under a contract or memorandum of agreement,
sends or allows some of its patients to be treated at a private local clinic or other health care entity, may transfer
prescription drug products to such a facility to be dispensed to patients. In other words, would such a transfer violate
the prohibition against the sale, purchase, or trade of prescription drugs by a hospital, health care entity, or charitable
institution?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that if a State or local government agency functions as or operates a hospital, health care entity, or charitable
institution, and a private health care entity is bound by a contractual agreement to the State or local government
agency, then the State or local government hospital or health care entity may sell prescription drugs to the contract
private health care entity provided that the prescription drugs sold are only used to serve government patients and
programs. The State or local government hospital or health care agency supplying the drug and the contract health
care entity would be obligated to implement appropriate controls to ensure that the drugs sold by the Government hospital
or health care entity to the contract health care entity are dispensed to patients in the Government program and not
diverted or sold to other patients or otherwise used for non-Government purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State or local government agency does not function as or operate a hospital, health care entity, or charitable
institution, and is acting as a prescription drug wholesaler, the prohibition against the sale of prescription drugs
by a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution would not be applicable.

3. Revocation of Acceptance, Reshipment, and Returns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes to clarify the circumstances under which hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions
may, without violating section 503(c)(3) of the act, return or ship back prescription drugs to the manufacturer or
distributor from which they were purchased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, proposed &sect;&sect;203.23 and 203.24 would, respectively, describe the conditions by which hospitals,
health care entities, and charitable institutions may: (1) Revoke acceptance of any prescription drug received
because of an ordering or delivery mistake and ship them back to the manufacturer or distributor, and (2) return a drug
to the manufacturer or distributor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of persons who submitted comments to the PDMA docket questioned the effect of the new statutory language on
commercial practice in the pharmaceutical industry. Several persons argued that the sales provisions in the Uniform
Commercial Code treat a sale as completed once a nondefective product has been ordered, delivered, and paid for, unless
specific contractual provisions make the sale conditional or revocable. Several persons urged that FDA view a return
for cash or credit after a completed sale as a new and prohibited sales transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, many other comments to the agency in the months after passage of PDMA observed that under common commercial
practice in the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturers and wholesale distributors permit returns and urged that
this practice be allowed to continue. FDA is aware that hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution pharmacies,
and distributors sometimes return products because of overstocks, changes in institutional formularies, the death
of a patient for whose use a drug product was acquired, or other reasons. The comments received by the agency argued
that to permit returns would both help to keep down the costs of medical care and reduce the risk that adulterated or
misbranded drugs would find their way into the diversion market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded that it should, under specified conditions, allow drug products to be shipped back
or returned to the manufacturer or distributor, and this tentative conclusion is reflected in proposed &sect;&sect;203.23
and 203.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.23, a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution could revoke a sale and purchase
transaction because of a mistake in ordering or delivery and ship the prescription drug back, provided: (1) The hospital,
health care entity, or charitable institution ships the drug back within 10 working days of receipt; (2) the reshipment
is made under proper storage, handling, and shipping conditions; and (3) if reshipped to the wholesale distributor,
the hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution provides written notice to the manufacturer of the revocation
and reshipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require that the manufacturer be notified of the reshipment so that any chargebacks to the manufacturer
by the wholesale distributor or special price reduction credited by the manufacturer to the wholesale distributor
would be factored into the credit or refund given the distributor. This is intended to prevent windfall profits from
the return of a specially priced drug to the wholesale distributor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.24, a hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution could return a product it
had purchased from a manufacturer or wholesale distributor, provided that: (1) The hospital, health care entity,
or charitable institution notifies the manufacturer that the prescription drug product has been returned to the
wholesale distributor; and (2) the hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution fills out a credit memo.
Proposed &sect;203.24 would require the hospital, health care entity, or charitable institution to send a copy of
the credit memo to the manufacturer, for the same reasons that notification of the manufacturer is required in the
event of a revocation and reshipment, i.e., so that any chargebacks or reduced prices will be factored into any credit
or refund to prevent windfall profits from the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.23 and 203.24 would both require detailed documentation to provide the kind of accountability
contemplated by the act to help ensure against diversion. To ensure that returned drugs remain safe and effective,
both proposed sections would require that drugs returned to a manufacturer or wholesale distributor be kept under
proper conditions for storage, handling, and shipping, and that written documentation reflecting the maintenance
of proper conditions be provided to the manufacturer or wholesale distributor to which the drugs are returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the value of any credit, refund, or merchandise exchanged for the returned product could not exceed
the purchase price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of clarification and to ensure that the State licensing regulation and this proposed rule, when adopted,
are consistent, the agency is also proposing to amend the definitions in the State licensing guidelines at &sect;205.3(f)
by adding two additional exceptions to ``wholesale distribution'' for the reshipment of drugs, when conducted in
accordance with &sect;203.23, and drug returns, when conducted in accordance with &sect;203.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Samples
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide accountability and oversight in the sample distribution process, PDMA established in section 503(d)
of the act a strict system of controls over the distribution of prescription drug samples, which are defined in section
503(c)(1) of the act. Under the statutory scheme, no person could distribute any drug sample, except for a manufacturer
or distributor who distributed drug samples in accordance with specific requirements and in response to a written
request from a licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 503(d)(1) and (d)(2) of the act, both manufacturers and distributors could engage in sample distribution
if certain requirements were followed. However, section 4(2) of PDA further restricted the persons who can engage
in distribution of drug samples by amending section 503(d)(1) and (d)(2) of the act to restrict sample distributions
to manufacturers and authorized distributors of record. This amendment is demonstrative of the intent of Congress,
as reflected elsewhere in PDMA and PDA, to restrict the activities of drug distributors who are not authorized distributors
of record. Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30, 203.31, and 203.33 through 203.39 are consistent with this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised statutory scheme, no person may distribute any drug sample, except for a manufacturer or authorized
distributor of record who distributes drug samples in accordance with specific requirements and in response to a
written request from a licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 503(d)(1) of the act states that, for purposes of this subsection, the term ``distribute'' does not include
the providing of a drug sample to a patient by a practitioner licensed to prescribe such drug, by a health care professional
acting at the direction and under the supervision of such a practitioner, or the pharmacy of a hospital or of another
health care entity acting at the direction of such a practitioner who received the drug sample in accordance with the
act and regulations. The definition of ``distribute'' in proposed &sect;203.3(h) reflects this statutory exclusion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA sets up two different sample distribution systems, depending on the mode of delivery: (1) By mail or common carrier,
and (2) by means other than mail or common carrier, i.e., representative or detailer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a sample is delivered by mail or common carrier, the statute requires the recipient to execute a written receipt
when the drug sample is delivered and return the receipt to the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record from
which the drug sample was received. If the sample is delivered by a representative, a number of additional procedures
are required by the statute that pertain to storage and handling, inventories, recordkeeping, reporting of thefts
and significant losses, notification of convictions of representatives for drug sample violations, and accountability.
The statute specifies minimum requirements for the contents of written request forms and details certain recordkeeping
and reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Requirements for Drug Sample Distribution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributors of record by mail
or common carrier are set forth in proposed &sect;203.30. The requirements for distribution of drug samples by representatives
are set forth in proposed &sect;203.31. The proposed sections provide detailed requirements for written request
forms, receipts, and recordkeeping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of these requirements are statutory; however, FDA has tentatively concluded that clarification of some of the
statutory requirements is desirable. FDA also has tentatively concluded that other requirements should be imposed
to help ensure smooth operation of the system, effective enforcement, effective accountability and oversight of
drug sample distribution, and provide adequate safeguards against drug sample diversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Contents of the Sample Request Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 would require the written request form for drug samples to bear certain information:
(1) The name, address, professional title, signature of the practitioner making the request; (2) the practitioner's
State license number or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identification number; (3) the proprietary or
established name and strength of the drug sample requested; (4) the quantity requested; (5) the name of the manufacturer
of the drug sample and the authorized distributor of record, if the drug sample is requested from a distributor; and
(6) the date of the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments suggested that it is sometimes difficult for a manufacturer or distributor to determine whether
or not a particular person who wishes to receive drug samples is a licensed practitioner. FDA has added the requirement
that the request form bear the practitioner's State license or DEA identification number to assist the manufacturer
or distributor in determining whether or not a person is a licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires a request form to bear the ``identity'' of the drug sample being requested. FDA has clarified
the meaning of ``identity'' in the proposed rule by specifying that the request form bear the proprietary or established
name and strength of the requested sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA requires that the request form bear the name of the manufacturer of the drug. However, where the statute also permits
an authorized distributor of record to distribute drug samples, the identity is incomplete without naming both the
manufacturer and distributor. In that circumstance, FDA proposes to require that the name of the distributor as well
as the manufacturer be made part of the sample request form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute also permits delivery of a drug sample to the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity at the request
of a licensed practitioner. However, the statute does not state how that request for delivery should be made. FDA has
tentatively concluded that the name and address of the intended recipient should be part of the request form. This
conclusion is reflected in the requirements in proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 that, if the request is being
made by a licensed practitioner for delivery of a drug sample to a hospital or health care entity pharmacy, the name
and address of the intended recipient be included on the request form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Drug Sample Receipts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 would require the execution of a written receipt by the recipient upon delivery
of a drug sample. The proposed sections also set out the contents of the receipt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires the execution of a receipt upon delivery of a drug sample by mail or common carrier to establish
an audit trail for drug sample orders and deliveries and to ensure that drug samples ordered are received. The statute
does not require the execution of a written receipt for samples delivered by representatives in the apparent belief
that a representative always delivers a drug sample to a licensed practitioner at the same time that the licensed practitioner
signs the request form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments suggested that samples frequently are not delivered at the time of the request, i.e., some time
elapses between request and delivery, even when a representative personally delivers the drug sample. Sometimes
the period of time is only a few minutes, but often it may be hours, days, or weeks. In some instances, a representative
may receive a request for a drug sample at one sales call and deliver the requested sample at a later date. In these cases,
because of lapses of memory, mistake, or because a diversion scheme may be underway, the samples delivered may not
always match the request. Accordingly, the agency has tentatively concluded that the requirement for a written receipt
should extend to all drug sample deliveries, and that requirement is included in proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and
203.31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A sample request and receipt need not be on separate forms if delivery is by a representative. A single form could be
devised and used containing all of the required information, which could be fully completed and executed with a single
signature, if the request and delivery are simultaneous, or executed in part with a signature for the request at the
time of the request, and executed in part with a second signature acknowledging receipt at the time of the delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;203.30(c) and 203.31(c) state that a receipt is to be on a form designated by the manufacturer
or distributor. If the drug sample is received by the requesting practitioner, both proposed sections would require
that the receipt contain the name, address, professional title, and signature of the practitioner or the practitioner's
designee who acknowledges delivery of the drug sample; the proprietary or established name and strength of the drug
sample, the quantity, and the lot or control number of the drug sample delivered; and the date of the delivery. If the
drug sample is received by the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity at the request of a licensed practitioner,
both proposed sections would require the receipt to contain the name and address of the requesting licensed practitioner,
the name and address of the hospital or health care entity pharmacy designated to receive the drug sample; the name,
address, professional title, and signature of the person acknowledging delivery of the drug sample; the proprietary
or established name and strength of the drug sample, the quantity, and the lot or control number of the drug sample delivered;
and the date of the delivery. FDA believes this information is necessary to ensure that the sample received is the same
as the sample requested.

4. Additional Requirements For Delivery of Drug Samples by Representatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA provides that manufacturers and distributors that utilize representatives for the delivery of drug samples
must abide by a number of additional requirements. These additional requirements are intended to guard against the
kinds of abuses that Congress' findings stated had been an integral part of the drug sample delivery system and had
led to large-scale drug sample diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inventories of drug samples of manufacturers' and distributors' representatives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The statute provides that each drug manufacturer or distributor that engages in drug sample distribution is required
to conduct, at least annually, a complete and accurate inventory of all drug samples in the possession of representatives
(21 U.S.C. 353(d)(3)(C)). The inventory is intended to guard against drug sample diversion by providing manufacturers
and distributors information that will permit them to identify diverters and take appropriate action and provide
data for FDA enforcement activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not specify what is meant by such an inventory, nor how it is to be conducted and reported. It is FDA's
preliminary view that such an inventory must go beyond a mere physical count, and that meaningful information and
data can only be provided if the inventory is conducted utilizing generally accepted inventory practices and a reconciliation
report is prepared that relates the latest inventory to the most recent prior inventory and to drug samples acquired
and distributed in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.31(d) would require the manufacturer or distributor to inventory all drug samples
in the possession of a manufacturer's or distributor's representative, and keep a record of the inventory. The record
would be required to identify all drug samples by established or proprietary name, dosage strength, and number of
sample units of each drug sample in stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require that the manufacturer or distributor reconcile the number of drug samples on hand with
the number received during the reporting period. The reconciliation report would be required to include: (1) A report
of the physical count of the most recently completed prior inventory; (2) a record of each drug sample shipment received
since the most recently completed prior inventory, including the sender and date of the shipment, and the established
or proprietary name, dosage strength, and number of sample units received; (3) a record of drug sample distributions
since the most recently completed inventory showing the name and address of each recipient of each sample unit shipped,
the date of the shipment, and the established or proprietary name, dosage strength, lot or control number, and number
of sample units shipped; and (4) an explanation for any significant loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure impartiality, the proposal would also require that the inventory and reconciliation reports be conducted
and prepared by persons other than the representatives being inventoried or their supervisors or managers in their
direct line of supervision or command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To guard against drug sample diversion, the proposed section would require manufacturers and distributors to evaluate
carefully any apparent discrepancy or significant loss in the inventory and reconciliation, and to investigate
fully any significant loss that cannot be justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lists of manufacturers' and distributors' representatives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires that each manufacturer or authorized distributor of record who distributes drug samples maintain
a list of the names and addresses of its representatives who distribute drug samples and of the sites where drug samples
are stored. The proposal restates this statutory requirement (&sect;203.31(e)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification if representative is convicted of violations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The statute requires drug manufacturers or distributors of record to report to FDA any conviction of a representative
for violations of section 503(c)(1) of the act or a State law because of the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample
or the offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample. The proposal restates this statutory requirement (&sect;203.31(f)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Drug Sample Storage and Handling Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has already excluded the distribution of drug samples by representatives from the definition of ``wholesale
distribution'' in &sect;205.3(f)(7), and the agency is proposing to adopt this exclusion in the definition of ``wholesale
distribution'' in proposed &sect;203.3(y). In view of this, representatives are not required to be licensed as wholesale
distributors by the States. PDMA requires manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to store all drug
samples under conditions that will maintain their stability, integrity, and effectiveness, and ensure that the
drug samples are not contaminated, deteriorated, or otherwise adulterated. Proposed &sect;203.32 reflects this
requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A representative, as an agent of the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record, is bound by the same standard,
and is required to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety and efficacy of any drug samples the representative
distributes. Generally, if a representative follows the labeling and compendial requirements for storage and handling
of a particular prescription drug in handling samples of that drug, the safety and efficacy of the drug sample may be
assured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Drug Sample Forms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of persons posed questions regarding drug sample request and receipt forms. FDA does not contemplate developing
its own forms for sample request and receipt, and instead intends to rely on manufacturers and distributors to develop
appropriate forms. Accordingly, any written request or receipt form developed by a manufacturer or authorized distributor
of record that complies with the requirements of proposed &sect;203.33 would be acceptable to FDA if it contains the
information and any signature required in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to encourage transmission and receipt of sample request and receipt forms by the most efficient
and expeditious means. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.33 would permit such forms to be delivered by mail, common
carrier, or private courier or to be transmitted photographically or electronically (i.e., by telephoto, wirephoto,
radiophoto, facsimile transmission (FAX), xerography, or electronic data transfer) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by any other system, provided that the method for transmission meets the security requirements set forth in proposed
&sect;203.60(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Written Policies and Procedures and Other Requirements for Drug Sample Distribution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received a number of questions and comments from drug manufacturers and distributors seeking assistance in developing
appropriate administrative systems for distributing drug samples. There are a wide variety of administrative systems
in use, and enforcement has been complicated by the multiplicity of sample distribution procedures. Although standardization
is not necessary, the agency believes that clear internal administrative systems are essential to ensure that sample
distribution is carried out efficiently and that the statutory requirements are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA expects that manufacturers and distributors will have administrative systems in place to review
all losses and thefts so that patterns that may indicate the possibility of drug sample diversion will be detected.
The agency believes that this is consistent with Congress' intent that manufacturers and distributors develop adequate
audit and security systems to detect and investigate sample losses and thefts. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 20; S. Rept.
100&hyph;202, p. 9.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under proposed &sect;203.34, each manufacturer or authorized distributor of record that distributes
drug samples would be expected to adopt an administrative system to monitor losses and thefts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, proposed &sect;203.34 would require drug manufacturers and distributors to establish, maintain, and adhere
to written policies and procedures describing its administrative systems for sample distribution. The proposed
section contemplates that each manufacturer's or distributor's written policies and procedures would describe
its administrative system for: (1) Distributing drug samples by mail or common carrier, including methodology for
reconciliation of requests and receipts; (2) distributing drug samples by means other than mail or common carrier;
(3) conducting its inventory of drug samples under proposed &sect;203.31(d), including an inventory schedule;
(4) auditing and detecting falsified or incomplete drug sample records; (5) identifying any significant loss of
drug samples and notifying FDA of the loss; (6) monitoring any loss or theft of drug samples; and (7) storing drug samples
by representatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Standing Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the House Report and Senate Report state that it is the intent of Congress that separate written requests be made
each time that samples are requested to be delivered and that standing requests do not fulfill the requirements of
the statute, except that the Senate Report states that FDA may provide by regulation for the delivery by mail of a small
number of samples for strictly limited periods of time. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 14; S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, p. 6.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.35 would require that separate written requests be made for each sample or group of samples and
does not allow for open-ended or standing requests to order drug samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed section states, however, that the agency does not consider standing requests to include an arrangement
by which a licensed practitioner requests in writing that a specified number of drug samples be delivered over a period
of not more than 6 months, with the actual delivery dates for parts of the order to be set by subsequent communication.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Use of Fulfillment Houses, Shipping and Mailing Services, Other Contractors, and Comarketing Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA understands that some manufacturers and distributors employ third parties to meet some of the requirements imposed
on them under PDMA. Third parties may include contractors such as fulfillment houses (companies that receive and
fill orders), mailing services, and other contractors. In addition, some manufacturers and distributors enter
into comarketing agreements in which one manufacturer or its representatives undertake a contractual commitment
to provide specified services relating to drug marketing for one or more other manufacturers or distributors. FDA
does not regard the use of third parties or entry into comarketing agreements as absolving a manufacturer or distributor
from its responsibility for complying with the statute and regulations pertaining to the distribution of its drug
samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.36 would make clear that a manufacturer or authorized distributor of record that
uses a fulfillment house, shipping or mailing service, or other third party to fulfill some of the requirements of
PDMA, or engages in a comarketing agreement with another manufacturer, remains responsible for creating and maintaining
all requests, receipts, forms, reports, and records required under PDMA, PDA, and proposed part 203.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency will give a manufacturer or distributor that contracts with a third party to maintain some or all of its records
up to 48 hours to produce requested forms, reports, records, or other required documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Investigation and Notification Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposed &sect;203.37, FDA proposes to codify the requirements and procedures for undertaking investigations
and making reports and notifications to the agency regarding sample distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Drug sample diversion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To ensure against drug sample diversion, proposed &sect;203.37(a) would impose an investigation and reporting
requirement on a manufacturer or distributor who has reason to believe that any person has falsified drug sample requests,
receipts, or records. A full and complete investigation would have to be undertaken, and the manufacturer or distributor
would be required to report to FDA that such an investigation is under way and that it has completed such an investigation.
The proposal would require the report to include the reason for the investigation and the results of the investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because persons who falsify drug sample requests may be prosecuted under Title 18 of the United States Code, and because
falsifications are often associated with drug diversion, FDA is proposing to require manufacturers and distributors
to report such offenses to the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the proposal would require that a manufacturer or distributor notify the agency of any falsification
of drug sample requests, receipts, or records, no later than 5 working days of learning of the falsification. The proposal
would permit an initial notification to be made by telephone or in writing, with a complete written report required
not later than 30 days after the date of the initial telephone or written notification.

Significant loss and known theft
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires a manufacturer or distributor that distributes drug samples to notify FDA of any significant loss
of drug samples and any known theft of drug samples (21 U.S.C. 353(d)(3)(D)). FDA believes that enforcement would
be facilitated if the manufacturer or distributor promptly notifies the agency upon becoming aware of a significant
loss or theft. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.37(b) would require a manufacturer or distributor to notify FDA
within 5 working days of becoming aware of such a loss or theft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;203.39 that charitable organizations be permitted to solicit and receive surplus drug
samples from licensed practitioners. As part of this program, FDA proposes to require that a charitable institution
that receives donated drug samples from a licensed practitioner also be required to notify FDA within 5 working days
of becoming aware of a loss or theft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reporting of any significant loss of drug samples is critical to the success of diversion control. Although a sample
can inadvertently become adulterated through mishandling, spoilage, or exposure to the elements, and although
samples are reported as stolen or lost from time to time, some representatives reportedly have used false claims of
damage, theft, or loss to divert drug samples into illicit commercial channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends this requirement to mean that the agency is to be advised of actual, physical losses, but not insignificant
accounting mistakes. The agency does not seek to receive reports concerning minor mathematical errors that are caught
and corrected in the normal course of business. These are not significant losses that would trigger the reporting
requirement. FDA seeks comment on how to distinguish between significant losses and minor accounting or inventory
errors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is mindful of the difficulty of establishing a threshold for significant loss and requests comment on this
issue and examples of situations that may and may not be appropriate reportable losses. FDA currently believes that
a small discrepancy in the total inventory of a multimillion dollar company may not be significant and thus may not
trigger the reporting requirement, but the loss of a hundred tablets of a particular drug by one sales representative
in one quarter might be significant. Similarly, a bookkeeping imbalance may not be a loss, as long as it represents
small inventory discrepancies that are likely to be accounted for in the normal course of audits or other methods of
inventory control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to establish any ``tolerance'' level for sample losses below which no report is required. Each
manufacturer or distributor is required to establish its own threshold for determining when inventory not accounted
for is significant. This threshold should be derived from the firm's past experience in sample distribution and inventory
and should be based on the level of accuracy of its internal audit and security system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some manufacturers or distributors might be able to set a historically validated statistical baseline for the minimal
amounts of shrinkage that might be caused by routine accounting errors, mistakes, or losses, and a statistical baseline
for the frequency of occurrences that might routinely happen with a particular representative or product. However,
any loss of drug samples exceeding the number or frequencies of the established baselines must be reported. In addition,
any loss possibly associated with falsification of drug sample inventory or distribution records, or connected
with diversion activity, suspicious circumstances, or theft must be investigated and reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When FDA becomes aware of a significant loss or theft of drug samples, it may conduct its own investigation in cooperation
with or independent of the manufacturer's or distributor's investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing that an initial notification of a significant loss or known theft be made by telephone or in writing,
with a complete written report required not later than 30 days after the date of the initial notification.

Conviction of a representative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. PDMA requires a manufacturer or distributor to notify FDA of any conviction of its representatives for a violation
of section 503(c)(1) of the act or any State law involving the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample or the offer to
sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample (21 U.S.C. 353(d)(3)(E)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that enforcement would be facilitated if prompt notice of such a conviction is provided to the agency.
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.37(c)(1) would require a manufacturer or distributor to notify FDA within 5 working
days of becoming aware of the conviction of one or more of its representatives for such a violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate such reports, proposed &sect;203.37(c) would permit an initial notification of such a conviction
to be made by telephone or in writing, but would require a complete written report to be submitted no later than 30 days
after the date of the initial notification.

number of the individual responsible for responding to a request for information respecting drug samples (21 U.S.C.
353(d)(3)(F)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that enforcement would be facilitated if that information is transmitted to the agency shortly after
a designation is made. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.37(d) would require a manufacturer or distributor to notify
FDA in writing within 30 days of the selection of such an individual and would also require the manufacturer or distributor
to supply the individual's business address to expedite easy communication.

11. Sample Lot or Control Numbers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A drug sample is a drug product as defined in 21 CFR 320.1(b). In 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1)(iii) and 201.18 of the general labeling
regulations and 21 CFR 211.130(b) of the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations, the label of drug
products is required to bear an identifying lot or control number capable of yielding the complete manufacturing
history of the package. Persons subject to the CGMP regulations are required under 21 CFR 211.196 to maintain distribution
records containing lot or control numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance of records of lot numbers on drug samples will help provide the kind of accountability and oversight of
prescription drug sample distribution that PDMA is intended to provide. A comment to the docket from the Department
of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General not only endorsed this view, but suggested that maintenance
of drug sample distribution records, including lot numbers, would be important for enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.38 would require the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record of drug
samples to include in the drug sample labeling, the label of the sample unit, and distribution records identifying
lot or control numbers that will permit the tracking of the distribution of each drug sample unit from the point of its
manufacture to the representative or, if delivered by mail or common carrier, to the licensed practitioner. (In addition,
as discussed earlier, proposed &sect;&sect;203.30 and 203.31 also require that drug sample request and receipt
forms include lot or control numbers.)

12. Sample Labels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has been advised that some manufacturers and distributors use ordinary stock packages as drug samples. The agency
believes that this practice makes it difficult to distinguish samples from ordinary stock and contributes to drug
diversion. FDA believes that it is essential that drug samples be clearly and easily recognizable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.38(c) would require that each sample unit bear a label that clearly denotes its
status as a drug sample. An appropriate designation would include (but not be limited to) the word ``sample'' and the
terms ``not for sale'' and ``professional courtesy package.'' The proposed section would also provide that drug
products that are labeled or imprinted as samples are deemed to be drug samples within the meaning of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An article that meets the statutory definition of a drug sample that fails to bear the label required in proposed &sect;203.38(c)
would still be a sample despite the absence of the required label.

13. Disposition of Drug Samples by Licensed Practitioners
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA permits manufacturers and distributors to distribute drug samples to licensed practitioners and to hospital
or health care entity pharmacies at the request of a licensed practitioner, provided certain documents and records
are created and maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA restricts drug sample distribution to ``licensed practitioners'' and to hospital or health care entity pharmacies
at the request of a ``licensed practitioner.'' A number of comments asked FDA to define the term ``licensed practitioner.''
For purposes of proposed part 203, FDA would, in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;203.3(o), define the term ``licensed practitioner'' to mean any person licensed by State law to prescribe
drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Physicians and surgeons, including osteopathic physicians and surgeons, are licensed to prescribe drugs in every
State, as are dentists and dental surgeons. In most States, podiatrists and optometrists are licensed to prescribe
certain drugs. In some States, pharmacists, physicians' assistants, paramedics, emergency medical technicians,
certified nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or other medical professionals or paraprofessionals
may be licensed to prescribe drugs, sometimes on their own authority and sometimes on the authority of supervising
physicians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States limit the authority to prescribe prescription drugs to specific protocols or formularies for certain
professionals or paraprofessionals. For those professionals and paraprofessionals, FDA follows the requirements
of those States and considers the authority to request and receive drug samples to be similarly limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 503(d)(1) of the act provides that no person may distribute any drug sample unless the requirements set forth
in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of that section are followed. Paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) set forth detailed requirements
for manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to follow when they distribute drug samples by mail or common
carrier and by representatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the section-by-section analysis that the Senate and House of Representatives ordered to be published in the Congressional
Record when PDA was introduced and passed, Congress stated that it did not intend this prohibition to restrict the
provision of a drug sample to a patient by a licensed practitioner or by another person at the direction of a licensed
practitioner in certain circumstances. (Congressional Record, August 10, 1992, p. S 12061&hyph;2; August 12, 1992,
p. H 8107&hyph;8.) Consequently, in PDA, Congress amended section 503(d)(1) of the act to clarify the prohibition
by stating that providing or dispensing a drug sample in certain circumstances is not considered distribution within
the meaning of the statute. The clarification specifically excludes from the term ``distribute'' the provision
of a drug sample to a patient by: (1) A practitioner licensed to prescribe such drug, (2) a health care professional
acting at the direction and under the supervision of such a practitioner, and (3) the pharmacy of a hospital or of another
health care entity that received the drug sample in accordance with the act and regulations, and that is acting at the
direction of the health care practitioner who requested the drug sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A licensed practitioner who provides a drug sample other than as set forth in section 503(d)(1) of the act is engaging
in an act of distribution, and drug sample distributions may be undertaken only as permitted by PDMA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that PDMA and this proposed rule would permit a licensed practitioner to: (1) Dispense the drug sample
as set forth in section 503(d)(1) of the act; (2) donate the drug sample to a charitable institution as provided for
in proposed &sect;203.39; (3) return the drug sample to the manufacturer or distributor; or (4) destroy the drug sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that any person, including a licensed practitioner, is prohibited from carrying out certain distributions
of drug samples, including: (1) Selling, purchasing, or trading (or offering to sell, purchase, or trade) any drug
sample; (2) requesting a manufacturer or distributor to deliver any drug sample to a retail pharmacy; (3) delivering
any drug sample to a retail pharmacy to be dispensed by the pharmacist to a patient of the licensed practitioner or other
persons; (4) giving any drug sample to a retail pharmacy; or (5) donating any drug sample to any charitable institution,
except as provided in proposed &sect;203.39. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDA singles out dispensing of drug samples by health care professionals who act at the direction and under the supervision
of licensed practitioners, and hospital or health care entity pharmacies that receive drug samples in accordance
with the act and regulations and that act at the direction of the health care practitioners who request samples. Thus,
Congress clearly intended to distinguish these persons from retail pharmacists. The pharmacist in a retail pharmacy
is an autonomous professional who is licensed by the State and supervised by the State Board of Pharmacy and independently
dispenses drugs to patients in response to a prescription written by a separate licensed practitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from delivering a drug sample to any retail pharmacy, and a retail pharmacy
is barred from receiving any drug sample from any person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has been advised that some licensed practitioners have requested that drug samples be delivered to retail pharmacies
in rural, isolated, or medically underserved areas for dispensing to the practitioner's patients. FDA views this
practice as being inconsistent with the accountability and oversight requirements imposed on sample distribution
by PDMA. The agency believes it makes enforcement of the sample distribution sections difficult, and is a potential
source of drug diversion. Accordingly, FDA advises that a practitioner should not request delivery of a drug sample
to a retail pharmacy and that a retail pharmacy should not accept a drug sample from a licensed practitioner or from
a manufacturer or distributor to be dispensed by the pharmacist to a practitioner's patients or to other persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To cut off a potential source of drug diversion and promote enforcement of PDMA, FDA advises licensed practitioners
that they should return adulterated or misbranded drug samples to the manufacturer or distributor, or destroy them.
Examples of drug samples that may be adulterated or misbranded include, but are not limited to: (1) Samples that have
gone beyond the labeled expiration date; (2) samples that are obviously discolored, soiled, spoiled, or otherwise
deteriorated; (3) samples with mutilated or damaged packaging; and (4) samples with labeling that is torn, adjusted,
or modified.

14. Donation of Drug Samples by Licensed Practitioners to Charitable Institutions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is aware of the practice whereby some licensed practitioners give significant quantities of drug samples to charitable
institutions, such as free clinics, charity nursing homes, and charitable health care entities. Donated drug samples
are then dispensed by staff of the charitable institutions to patients or given to domestic or overseas missions or
other charitable institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some charitable institutions actively solicit and collect donations of drug samples from licensed practitioners,
and it is not uncommon for charitable institutions to rely on donated drug samples as a significant source of prescription
drugs for patient care. In response to concerns about this practice, FDA established procedures for drug sample donations
in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7132.08, ``Collection and Charitable Distribution of Drugs,'' issued on October
1, 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA continues to be concerned about drug sample donations. The agency believes that ongoing donations of drug samples
by licensed practitioners to charitable institutions could be considered as being inconsistent with the objectives
of accountability and oversight of sample distribution that PDMA is designed to provide. The agency is concerned
that this practice could make enforcement of the sample distribution sections difficult and provide an avenue for
drug diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the principal purposes of PDMA was to prevent drug diversion. The easiest way to ensure that prescription drug
samples will not be diverted by charitable institutions would be to prohibit such institutions from possessing them.
However, Congress did not choose to do so. Indeed, PDMA explicitly allows prescription drug samples to be delivered
by a manufacturer or distributor to the pharmacy of a hospital or health care entity at the written request of a licensed
practitioner. Such a hospital or health care entity may be operated for profit or as a charitable institution. PDMA
is silent, however, as to whether or not there are other legitimate means by which a charitable institution can acquire
prescription drug samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operations of not-for-profit hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions were closely scrutinized
by Congress before the passage of PDMA. Congress identified sales of drugs acquired at below-wholesale prices by
hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions as a source of unfair competition for prescription
drug wholesalers who are required to pay the average wholesale price, and suggested that such sales could be a source
of drug diversion. (See sec. 2(7), PDMA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress also identified the sale of prescription drug samples as a source of diversion (see sec. 2(6), PDMA), but
did not suggest that charitable institutions were peculiarly likely to engage in this abuse. Instead, Congress sought
to balance the need for restrictions that would prevent unfair competition and put an end to diversion of prescription
drug samples with the goals of providing prescription drugs to all who need them and permitting the distribution,
with appropriate restrictions, of prescription drug samples to patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress did not alter this balance when in PDA, it revised the PDMA sample distribution restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has preliminarily concluded that development of a system that would permit licensed practitioners to donate
excess quantities of prescription drug samples to charitable institutions for dispensing to patients or for further
distribution to domestic or overseas charitable institutions for dispensing to patients would be consistent with
PDMA, PDA, and the goal of providing adequate medical care to patients in need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A system that would permit such donations with adequate restrictions would ensure wider opportunities for the provision
of medical care, including prescription drugs, to patients in need, and would, if appropriate controls were established
similar to those governing sample distribution, be consistent with the language and intent of the statute. Controls
would serve the objectives of accountability and oversight in the act and minimize the potential for drug diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a system would also prevent the waste of significant quantities of valuable prescription drugs that have been
distributed as drug samples to licensed practitioners who have not used or dispensed them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that such a system should contain audit and security protection, similar to those required in the statute
for requesting drug samples from manufacturers or distributors and delivering them to licensed practitioners,
to provide accountability and oversight, and to protect the public against drug diversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In designing such a system, the agency has kept in mind that the day-to-day operations of licensed practitioners,
including the provision of prescription drugs to patients, are regulated primarily by the States. In addition, there
is nothing in the legislative history of PDMA or PDA that would suggest that Congress intended FDA to become more deeply
involved in the regulation of the activities of licensed practitioners, except to the extent necessary to ensure
that drug samples are not diverted and that they do not, as a result, become adulterated or misbranded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency is proposing to establish a system of drug sample donation controls in proposed &sect;203.39.
Proposed &sect;203.39 would set up a system that would permit a licensed practitioner to donate a drug sample to a charitable
institution for dispensing to a patient of that institution or for distribution to another properly enrolled charitable
institution for subsequent dispensing to patients, provided that the institution is properly enrolled and certain
requirements are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.39, a charitable institution that wishes to solicit or receive drug samples would be required
to: (1) Become properly enrolled by notifying the agency of its intention to solicit and receive drug sample donations
and obtaining a central file number; and (2) maintain records of drug samples received as donations and subsequently
dispensed or distributed to other charitable institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recipient charitable institution must provide written certification of compliance with all regulations to a licensed
practitioner or charitable institution that provides a drug sample before receiving any drug sample donation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the charitable institution or organization (defined as one that has been granted tax exempt status
by the Department of the Treasury under the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)
would be required to enroll with FDA. A charitable institution would be enrolled when it has notified the appropriate
FDA district office that it intends to solicit and receive drug samples, has made application to the district office
for a central file number, and has received the number. A charitable institution would also be required to be licensed
by the State, if required by State law, and otherwise conform to State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b) would establish procedures that the charitable institution would be required to follow
for receiving, holding, dispensing, and distributing donated drug samples. These requirements closely parallel
the statutory and proposed regulatory requirements for request and delivery of drug samples by manufacturers and
distributors to licensed practitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.39(b)(1), a recipient charitable institution would be required to provide a written identification
document to any employee or agent authorized to act on behalf of the institution in soliciting or receiving donations
of prescription drug samples. The employee or agent identification document would be valid for a limited term, but
could be renewed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to delineate the form and content of the required identification document, but it should be sufficient
to readily identify the agent or employee of the charity and to establish that he or she has the authority to solicit
and receive drug sample donations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such an identification document would be acceptable to the agency, for example, if it: (1) Would be effective for a
fixed term, e.g., 1 year, and would bear an expiration date; (2) would include the name, address, and central file number
of the charitable institution; (3) would exhibit the name, signature, and photograph of the authorized employee
or agent; and (4) would display an affirmative statement that the employee or agent identified on the document is authorized
by the institution to solicit and receive donations of prescription drug samples on behalf of the institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(2) would require each recipient charitable institution to maintain a current listing
of all agents or employees authorized to solicit and receive drug samples on behalf of the institution. The listing
would also be required to include the name and telephone number of the authorized agent or employee in charge of prescription
drug sample solicitation, receipt, and redistribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One problem associated with drug sample diversion has been the practice of ``shucking'' drug samples (separating
drug sample dosage units from their sample packaging (usually blister packs, cards, or small boxes) and sample labeling)
and repackaging them (often in plastic bags or ``baggies,'' or in other nonstandard containers with other sample
dosage units from the same or different drug sample lots or production runs). This repackaging process may be accompanied
by physical tampering with the sample dosage units with sharp or abrasive instruments or with solvents to remove imprints
denoting their status as samples. Because this practice adulterates and misbrands the samples, proposed &sect;203.39(b)(3)
would require that a drug sample could be donated by a licensed practitioner or donating charitable institution and
could be received by a charitable institution only in its original, unopened packaging with its labeling intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(4) would permit delivery of a donated drug sample to a recipient charitable institution
by mail or common carrier, collection by an authorized agent or employee of the recipient charitable institution,
or personal delivery by a licensed practitioner or an authorized agent or employee of the donating charitable institution.
It would direct that the donor place the donated drug samples in a sealed carton for delivery to or collection by the
recipient institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;203.39(b)(5), a donated drug sample could not be dispensed to a patient or be distributed to
another charitable institution until a licensed practitioner or registered pharmacist at the recipient charitable
institution has examined it to confirm that the drug sample delivered matches the donation record and that any adulterated
or misbranded drug sample is eliminated. The recipient would be required to reject any drug sample that: (1) Is out
of date; (2) has labeling that has become mutilated, obscured, or detached from the drug sample packaging; (3) shows
evidence of having been stored or shipped under conditions that might adversely affect its stability, integrity,
or effectiveness; (4) is for a drug product that has been recalled or is no longer marketed; or (5) is otherwise possibly
contaminated, deteriorated, or adulterated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(6) would require recipient charitable institutions to dispose of any drug sample found
to be unsuitable by destroying it or by returning it to the manufacturer and to maintain complete records of the disposition
of all drug samples destroyed or returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(7) would require that, if a donated drug sample is collected by an authorized agent or employee
of the recipient charitable institution or is personally delivered by a licensed practitioner or an authorized agent
of a donating charitable institution, the employee or agent of the recipient institution is to prepare at the time
of collection or delivery a complete and accurate donation record for the samples. Both the donor and recipient would
be required to sign the donation record when it is created, and the donor and recipient would each retain a copy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a donated drug sample is transferred by mail or common carrier, the licensed practitioner or donating charitable
institution would be required to prepare a donation record that would be signed by the licensed practitioner or authorized
agent of the donating charitable institution (&sect;203.39(b)(8) and (b)(9)). The donation record would be shipped
with the drug sample. An authorized agent or employee of the recipient charitable institution would be required to
countersign it, keep a copy, and return a copy to the licensed practitioner or donating charitable institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(9) would require the donation record to include: (1) The name, address, and telephone
number of the licensed practitioner (or donating charitable institution), and the practitioner's professional
title and State license number or DEA identification number; (2) the manufacturer, brand name, quantity, and lot
or control number of the sample; (3) the date of the donation; (4) the signature of the licensed practitioner (or the
signature of the authorized agent of the donating charitable institution); and (5) the signature of the authorized
agent or employee of the recipient charitable institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require charitable institutions to maintain complete and accurate records of donation, receipt,
inspection, inventory, dispensing, redistribution, destruction, and returns sufficient for complete accountability
and auditing of drug sample stocks (&sect;203.39(b)(10)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would also require each recipient charitable institution to conduct an inventory of drug sample stocks, at least
annually, utilizing independent inventory personnel, and to prepare a report reconciling the results of each inventory
with the most immediate prior inventory. Inventory discrepancies and reconciliation problems would be required
to be investigated by the charitable institution and reported to FDA (&sect;203.39(b)(11)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(12) would require that a recipient charitable institution provide written certification
to the licensed practitioner or donating charitable institution that it is in conformity with all the requirements
of proposed part 203 before receiving any drug sample donation. Such certification, which links the licensed practitioner
with the charitable institution, could be made part of the donation record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(b)(13) would require a recipient charitable institution to store drug samples under conditions
that will maintain the samples' stability, integrity, and effectiveness, and ensure that the drug samples will be
free of contamination, deterioration, and adulteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.39(c) would also specify that a charitable institution may donate drug samples to another recipient
charitable institution for dispensing to patients, provided that the recipient charitable institution meets the
appropriate requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the procedure for drug sample donations delineated in proposed &sect;203.39, there are alternative
means available for charities to receive donated prescription drug products from manufacturers and distributors.
These include: (1) Direct donations of prescription drug stock by manufacturers or distributors, with records of
distribution and receipt being maintained in accordance with State regulations; and (2) deliveries of drug samples
to charity hospital and health care entity pharmacies by manufacturers and distributors or their representatives
under the request of a licensed practitioner in accordance with the requirements set forth in proposed &sect;&sect;203.30
and 203.31.

15. Free Distributions That Are Not Samples

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain situations in which manufacturers and distributors may deliver prescription drugs at no charge
without such free distributions being samples. Accordingly, such distributions are not subject to the recordkeeping
requirements for samples. Nevertheless, FDA believes that States and manufacturers and distributors should establish
recordkeeping requirements and systems, where appropriate, to prevent diversion.

Distribution of drugs to indigent patients
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As noted above, a drug sample is defined at proposed &sect;203.3(i) as a unit of a prescription drug that: (1) Is not
intended to be sold; and (2) is intended to promote the sale of the drug. Drugs that are given free of charge to patients
in some circumstances may not necessarily be samples. For example, manufacturers of some expensive new drugs have
decided that, under certain circumstances, they will arrange for licensed practitioners to prescribe and dispense
these drugs at no charge or at reduced cost to indigent patients. In FDA's view, if the objective of this practice is
to ensure that patients in need of prescription drugs will have access to them, whatever their financial circumstances,
then it is not a promotional scheme, and such drugs are not samples under section 503(c)(1) of the act or proposed &sect;203.3(i).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Starter packs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Starter packs are also not drug samples. Starter packs are prescription drug products distributed without charge
by manufacturers or distributors to pharmacists with the intent that the pharmacists place the prescription drugs
in stock and sell them at retail. Starter packs may be distributed by manufacturers' or wholesale distributors' representatives
(detailers), by mail or common carrier, or by direct delivery from a manufacturer or distributor. Starter packs of
solid oral dosage forms can be offered in ordinary stock packages, in special packaging comprised of unit-of-use
or course-of-treatment sizes, or in special packaging smaller than standard stock packages whose sizes have no relationship
to treatment regimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starter packs are intended to ``prime the pump'' by making a product available at no cost to the pharmacist so the pharmacist
will fill prescriptions with the manufacturer's product. They permit the patient and pharmacist to become familiar
with the manufacturer's product. Starter packs are a widely used selling tool and thus are intended to promote the
sale of the drug. Representatives often will make a sales presentation before delivering them or at the same time they
are delivered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDMA's definition of drug sample sets up a two-element test that determines whether a particular item of prescription
drug is a drug sample. The two-element test requires that the drug: (1) Is not intended to be sold; and (2) is intended
to promote the sale of the drug. Starter packs meet the second element of the drug sample test because they are intended
to promote the sale of a particular drug. However, even though starter packs are delivered without charge to pharmacists,
they do not conform to the first element of the statutory drug sample definition because the manufacturer or distributor
intends that they be sold by the pharmacist. Accordingly, starter packs are not samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because starter packs are not samples, they are not subject to the sample restrictions in PDMA. Instead, they are subject
to regulation as prescription drugs under the act in like manner as stock shipments of prescription drugs. Because
starter packs are not drug samples, the request, receipt, and recordkeeping requirements in PDMA for samples do not
apply, and pharmacists are free to sell these products at retail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because starter packs provide opportunities for diversion similar to those presented by drug samples, manufacturers,
and distributors should establish and maintain accounting, audit, and security systems for starter packs to guard
against diversion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pharmacy colleges
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For many years, manufacturers have given pharmacy schools and colleges pharmaceutical products for teaching purposes.
These products are given to help the schools train pharmacy students in drug formulation, compounding, packaging,
and labeling, and to familiarize students with dosage forms. These products are not intended to be distributed or
dispensed, nor are they intended to promote the sale of the drug. Accordingly, the agency does not view prescription
drugs donated to colleges of pharmacy for educational purposes as drug samples.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Donations of drugs to charitable institutions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There is nothing in PDMA or in the legislative history of PDMA that would suggest that PDMA is intended to discourage
direct donations by manufacturers or distributors of stock packages of prescription drug products to charitable
institutions. Because these donations provide patients with the prescription drugs they need without regard to
cost and are not intended to promote the sale of the drug, the distributions are not sample distributions within the
meaning of section 503(c)(1) of the act or proposed &sect;203.3(i).

16. ``Bid'' and ``Commercial'' Samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers of drug products sometimes take delivery of bulk drug ingredients or precursor specimens for testing
and evaluation purposes. These specimens are scrutinized for compatibility with a manufacturer's production equipment
and to determine if they are suitable for use in formulating the drug products the manufacturer wishes to produce.
Sometimes, manufacturers take delivery of examples of unpackaged finished dosage forms to determine if they are
suitable for use with the manufacturer's packaging materials and equipment. These specimens, referred to as ``bid''
or ``commercial'' samples, are generally delivered in limited quantities for evaluation purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act defines a drug sample as a unit of a drug subject to section 503(b) of the act (i.e., a prescription drug), which
is not intended to be sold and is intended to promote the sale of the drug (21 U.S.C. 353(c)(1)). Proposed &sect;203.3(i)
restates this definition. Because of the statutory language and the threat of diversion, persons who distribute
``bid'' or ``commercial'' samples should follow the requirements for sample distribution set forth in the act and
this proposed rule.

1. Identifying Statements (``Pedigrees'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(e)(1) of the act imposed a new requirement on ``unauthorized'' or ``secondary'' wholesale prescription
drug distributors (wholesale drug distributors who are not authorized distributors of record) to provide to a wholesale
distributor purchaser, before the completion of a sale, a statement identifying each sale of the drug (often referred
to as a ``statement of origin'' or ``drug pedigree''). PDA expanded this requirement by specifying the information
to be included in the drug pedigree and mandating that it be provided to retail pharmacy buyers as well as wholesale
distributor purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pedigree requirements for unauthorized distributors under PDMA, as later amended by PDA, have been a matter of
continuing interest and discussion. These requirements affect only unauthorized wholesale distributors (i.e.,
those who do not have an ongoing business relationship with a manufacturer to distribute that manufacturer's drugs)
and impose upon them more stringent requirements than are imposed on authorized distributors of record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before passage of PDA, section 503(e)(1) of the act required that each person engaged in the wholesale distribution
of drugs subject to section 503(b) of the act (prescription drugs) who is not an authorized distributor of record of
such drugs provide to each wholesale distributor of such drugs a statement identifying each sale of the drug, including
the date of the sale, before the sale to such wholesale distributor. Soon after the enactment of PDMA, the terms ``secondary''
and ``unauthorized'' distributors became common to describe persons who are not authorized distributors of record,
and the term ``drug pedigree'' became popular to describe the required statement of origin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to make it possible to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized distributors, section 503(e)(1)
of the act also required each manufacturer to maintain at its corporate offices a current list of its authorized distributors.
This requirement was not altered by PDA, which otherwise amplified the pedigree requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Congress adopted section 503(e)(1) of the act, it was responding to information uncovered by the Oversight Subcommittee
of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The Committee found that most counterfeit, stolen, expired, or fraudulently
obtained drugs entering commercial channels had been handled by distributors who were not authorized to distribute
the manufacturer's product, rather than by the manufacturer's authorized distributors. Accordingly, Congress
imposed a more stringent reporting requirement on distributions by unauthorized distributors, requiring them
to inform their wholesale customers of all previous sales of the drug product. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 17.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments to the agency after enactment of PDMA reflected concerns about application of the drug pedigree
requirement. One comment asked FDA to consider whether the drug pedigree must include the name and address of the seller,
or whether a general statement, such as ``this shipment of drugs came from an unnamed authorized distributor on _________
__, 199_,'' or a coded statement, such as ``this shipment of drugs came from unauthorized distributor [code] on _______
__, 199_,'' would comply with PDMA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated its position on the form and content of the drug pedigree requirement in PDMA in a section of the August
1, 1988, information and guidance letter to regulated industry and other interested parties. The August 1, 1988,
letter requested that any drug pedigree be in writing, that it bear the title ``Statement Identifying Prior Sales
of Prescription Drugs by Unauthorized Distributors Required by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act,'' and that
it include all necessary identifying information regarding all sales in the chain of distribution of the product,
starting with the manufacturer or authorized distributor of record. The agency believed that this was consistent
with the legislative history of PDMA, which indicated that Congress intended that the drug pedigree be a written certification
fully identifying the source and place from which the drugs were obtained. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 17; S. Rept. 100&hyph;202,
p. 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 1, 1988, letter, the agency requested that the identifying statement include the following information:
(1) The business name and address of the source from which the drug was purchased; (2) the date of the sale; and (3) the
identity, strength, container size, number of containers, and lot number(s) of the drug. FDA also requested that
the drug pedigree accompany all products purchased from an unauthorized distributor, even when they are resold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Late in 1988, the American Association of Pharmaceutical Distributors (AAPD), an organization of wholesale prescription
drug distributors who are not authorized distributors of record for some or all of the products they distribute, designed
a form for drug pedigrees that substituted codes for names and addresses. AAPD's system, which is now reportedly being
used by its members and certain nonmembers, is administered by an accountant employed by AAPD for that purpose. The
agency does not know if other code systems exist that are being used in place of the required names and addresses on drug
pedigrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the months following passage of PDMA, some Senators and members of Congress wrote to support coded pedigrees or
pedigrees that did not disclose full names and addresses. However, others expressed their support for full disclosure
on drug pedigrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even before passage of PDA, FDA considered that Congress had intended the PDMA drug pedigree requirement to require
that each party in a chain of distribution be given sufficient information to make an informed determination as to
the origin of drugs being purchased. In the agency's view, general statements of origin could not provide sufficient
information for purchasers, and coded statements that made information unintelligible to purchasers without the
intervention of a trade association or regulatory agency to decipher the code, would not provide purchasers with
the information that Congress intended that they receive. In FDA's opinion, the only meaningful way to identify the
``source and place'' from which drugs were obtained was to require that the identifying statement bear the business
name and address of each previous distributor and the date of each prior sale. Furthermore, the only meaningful way
to identify fully the drugs being described was to provide detailed particulars about the drugs being sold. FDA has
stated this position in a number of letters, speeches, and public comments since PDMA became law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDA amendments to the PDMA significantly tightened the drug pedigree requirement and constitute Congress' latest
word on the issue. PDA amended section 503(e)(1) of the act to require that unauthorized distributors provide, before
a sale takes place, a drug pedigree to every wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy customer. The drug pedigree
is required to identify all prior sales, purchases, or trades of such drugs and to specify by name and address all parties
to the transactions. PDA also states that FDA may require additional information or a specific form for the drug pedigree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As Congress stated in the section-by-section analysis that accompanied PDA when it was introduced and passed, the
stricter language in the PDA revision ``makes it clear'' that any wholesale distribution of a prescription drug by
an unauthorized distributor, including any sale to another unauthorized distributor, an authorized distributor
of record, or a retail pharmacy, must be preceded by a full and complete identifying statement. ``The identifying
statement,'' the analysis added, ``must in all cases include the dates of each transaction involving the drug and
the names and addresses of all parties to the transaction, and must contain any such other information as the Secretary
may require.'' (Congressional Record, page S 12061, August 10, 1992; page H 8107, August 12, 1992.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Passage of PDA thus gave added emphasis to Congress' intent, as stated in the legislative history of PDMA, to restore
accountability to the wholesale sector of the pharmaceutical market and to regulate the wholesale distribution
of prescription drug products. (H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, pp. 16&hyph;17; S. Rept. 100&hyph;202, p. 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.50(a) would restate the statutory requirement that, before the completion of any wholesale
distribution by an unauthorized wholesaler to another wholesale distributor or retail pharmacy, the seller is required
to provide to the purchaser a statement identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of such drug. It would require
that the drug pedigree include: (1) The proprietary and established name of the drug; (2) the dosage; (3) the container
size; (4) the number of containers; (5) the drug's lot or control number(s); (6) the business name and address of all
parties to each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacturer; and (7) the date of each previous
transaction involving the drug.

2. Additional Manufacturing Processes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A manufacturer applies at least one manufacturing process to a bulk drug substance or precursor product to produce
a finished dosage form or a precursor product that will be further manufactured into a finished dosage form. Each of
these processes produces a changed product. Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.50(b) specifies that a manufacturer
who subjects a drug to any additional manufacturing processes to produce a different drug is not required to provide
to a purchaser a statement identifying the previous sales of the component drug or drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Authorized Distributor Lists
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.50(c) would require each manufacturer to maintain at the corporate offices a current written
list of all authorized distributors of record. The term ``authorized distributor of record'' is defined in proposed
&sect;203.3(b) to mean a distributor with whom a manufacturer has established an ongoing relationship to distribute
such manufacturer's products. Because an agreement by which a single shipment of drugs is distributed would not constitute
an ongoing relationship (see proposed &sect;203.3(r)) that shipment would not establish an ``authorized distributor
of record'' relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require the manufacturer's list to specify whether each distributor listed is authorized
to distribute the manufacturer's full product line, or only particular, specified products. The proposal would
also require the manufacturer to update the list on a continuing basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the PDMA legislative history, Congress stated that manufacturers' lists of authorized distributors of record
should be freely available to the public. Accordingly, FDA is also proposing that each manufacturer make its list
of authorized distributors of record available on request to the public for inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Unknown Origins or ``Salvaged'' Drugs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments inquired about persons that purchase lost or abandoned drugs from transportation companies
for sale to licensed wholesale distributors. This procedure is sometimes referred to as drug salvage, although it
differs from the process identified as salvaging in 21 CFR part 211. These inquiries suggested that identifying statements
for ``salvaged'' drugs should list the transportation company from which the drugs were ``salvaged'' as the point
of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that this kind of business operation cannot meet the requirements of the CGMP regulations, nor can it
operate in a manner consistent with PDMA's requirements (e.g., that a wholesale distributor give a wholesale distributor
purchaser a statement of origin for the product being sold).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's view is that the requirement for a statement of origin is designed to permit prospective purchasers to determine
if the source of a drug is a legitimate source, such as an authorized distributor or secondary distributor licensed
by the State as a wholesale distributor. The agency believes that an ``origin unknown'' statement or a statement that
a particular shipment of prescription drugs originated as ``salvage'' or that they came from a lost shipment from
unknown persons at an unknown time would not be consistent with the meaning of that provision. Thus, in FDA's view,
use of an ``origin unknown'' or ``salvage'' statement would not meet the requirement for an identifying statement
under section 503(e)(1) of the act.

5. State Licensing of Wholesale Distributors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA established a requirement that any person engaged in the wholesale distribution in interstate commerce of prescription
drugs in a State be licensed by the State in accordance with guidelines issued as a final rule by the agency (21 U.S.C.
353(e)(2)). The final rule that set forth guidelines for State licensing of wholesale prescription drug distributors
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 14, 1990 (55 FR 38012), making the requirement that any person engaging in the wholesale distribution
of prescription drugs in interstate commerce shall be licensed by the State in which it operates, become effective
September 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Congress passed PDA, which modified the State licensing requirement, before the date on which the requirement
would have gone into effect. PDA amended section 503(e) of the act to establish a temporary Federal registration procedure
for wholesale prescription drug distributors in those States that do not have a licensing program that meets the Federal
guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This temporary Federal wholesale distributor registration procedure expires on September 14, 1994. After that
date, all persons engaged in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs in interstate commerce are required
to be licensed by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA issued a letter to industry and other interested persons on September 3, 1992, that provides information and guidance
on the procedure to be followed by wholesale distributors required to register under the temporary Federal wholesale
distributor registration procedure established by PDA. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

6. Defining ``Wholesale Distribution''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``wholesale distribution'' is defined in section 503(e)(4)(B) of the act as distribution of prescription
drugs to other than the consumer or patient, but not including intracompany sales or distributions of drugs described
in section 503(c)(3)(B) of the act. The exclusions under section 503(c)(3)(B) of the act are for the purchase or other
acquisition by a hospital or other health care entity member of a group purchasing organization of a drug for its own
use from the organization or from other hospitals or health care entity members of the organization; the sale, purchase,
or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug by a charitable organization to a nonprofit affiliate
of the organization to the extent otherwise permitted by law; the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or an offer to sell,
purchase, or trade a drug among hospitals or other health care entities under common control; the sale, purchase,
or trade of a drug or an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug for emergency medical reasons; and the sale, purchase,
or trade of a drug, an offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug, or the dispensing of a drug pursuant to a prescription
executed in accordance with section 503(b) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These exclusions are part of the proposed definition of ``wholesale distribution'' in proposed &sect;203.3(y).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For clarity, FDA proposes to codify additional exclusions in proposed &sect;203.3(y) that have already been discussed
in this notice. They are the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers' and authorized distributors' representatives;
the sale, purchase, or trade of blood and blood components intended for transfusion; drug reshipments, when conducted
in accordance with proposed &sect;203.23; and drug returns, when conducted in accordance with proposed &sect;203.24.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, as discussed below, FDA is proposing to codify an exclusion from the definition of wholesale distribution
for the sale of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For consistency, FDA is also proposing to incorporate these additional exclusions in the definition of ``wholesale
distribution'' at &sect;205.3(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Sales to Licensed Practitioners by Retail Pharmacies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, a retail pharmacy that engages in the business of selling prescription drugs to licensed practitioners
is a wholesale distributor that, since September 15, 1992, has been required to be licensed by the State as a wholesaler
or registered with FDA if the State does not have a conforming licensing program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensed practitioners often purchase small quantities of drugs from retail pharmacies for office use. Many wholesale
distributors are reluctant to open accounts with individual practitioners for small quantities of drugs, and some
practitioners believe that there is no cost-effective, reasonable alternative for making occasional purchases
of small quantities of drugs for office use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history supports the view that Congress did not intend to interfere with this small-scale practice.
According to the House Report, ``It is the express intent of the Committee that the scope of section 6 include distribution
by * * * all sellers of prescription drugs in wholesale quantities to persons or firms other than the consumer or patient.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H. Rept. 100&hyph;76, p. 17.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that permitting the sale of small quantities of prescription drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed
practitioners for office use without the requirement of a State wholesale distributor's license satisfies a legitimate
need and is consistent with the intent of the statute. Accordingly, the agency has included language in proposed &sect;203.3(y)
that would exclude the sale of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office
use from the definition of ``wholesale distribution.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this context, sales of prescription drugs by a retail pharmacy to licensed practitioners for office use will be
considered to be minimal if the total annual dollar volume of prescription drugs sold to licensed practitioners does
not exceed 5 percent of the dollar volume of that retail pharmacy's annual prescription drug sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a retail pharmacy is engaged in wholesale sales of prescription drugs in any amount after September 15, 1992, the
presumption will be that the retail pharmacy is, in fact, a wholesale distributor that must be licensed by the State
in accordance with part 205, or registered with FDA if the State does not have a conforming licensing program, unless
it can be shown that the total annual dollar volume of its sales to licensed practitioners does not exceed 5 percent
of the dollar volume of that pharmacy's annual prescription drug sales and the pharmacy does not otherwise engage
in wholesale distribution.

8. Sales to Wholesale Distributors by Retail Pharmacies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received a number of questions asking whether PDMA prohibits a retail pharmacy from selling prescription drugs
to a wholesale distributor. FDA advises that there is no provision in PDMA, the final PDMA State licensing guidelines,
or this proposed rule that would prohibit a retail pharmacy from selling prescription drugs to a wholesale distributor.
However, a retail pharmacy that engages in such sales would become a wholesale distributor that would be required
to provide the wholesale distributor purchaser with an identifying statement for the drugs sold and would be required
to have a valid State wholesale distributor license or be registered with FDA if the State does not have a conforming
licensing program.

F. Request and Receipt Forms, Reports, and Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;203.60 sets forth standards for request and receipt forms, reports, and for the creation, retention,
and maintenance of records and other documents under proposed part 203. These requirements, although procedural
in nature, are essential for the efficient administration and enforcement of PDMA and proposed part 203.

1. Recordkeeping Media
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing that manufacturers and distributors have the option of creating or maintaining records on nonpaper
media. FDA believes that recent technological advances compel the agency to reexamine how the requirements for written
records (including forms bearing written signatures) can be satisfied by electronic media. FDA believes that greater
efficiency, lower costs, and more effective enforcement can result from an effort to facilitate the development
and use of photographic, electronic, and other nonpaper devices, and media for creation and maintenance of sample
requests, receipts, records, and other forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;203.60(a) would permit request and receipt forms, reports, records, and other documents
required by PDMA, PDA, and this proposed rule to be created on paper or on electronic media.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.60(b) would permit request and receipt forms, reports, records, and other documents required
by PDMA, PDA, and this proposal that are created on paper to be maintained on paper or by photographic or electronic
recordation or imaging, provided that appropriate security and authentication requirements are followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.60(c) would permit request and receipt forms, reports, records, and other documents required
by PDMA, PDA, and this proposal that are created by means of electronic data entry and recordkeeping equipment to be
stored using computer technologies, provided that appropriate security and authentication requirements are followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, appropriate photographic records and electrographic records could include, but not be limited
to, those maintained on microfilm, microcard, microfiche, and xerographic copies. Appropriate electronic records
could include, but not be limited to, those maintained in analog or digital form or by means of image recording technology
on computer disks, cards, tapes, memory chips, or optical media.

The proposed rule would require that any request or receipt form, report, record, or other document, and any signature
appearing thereon, is to be created, maintained, or transmitted in a form that provides reasonable assurance of being:
(1) Resistant to tampering, revision, modification, or alteration; (2) preserved in accessible and retrievable
fashion; and (3) visible or readily made visible to permit copying or other means of duplication for purposes of review,
analysis, verification, authentication, and reproduction by the person who executed the form or created the record,
by the manufacturer or distributor, and by authorized personnel of FDA or other regulatory and law enforcement agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Retention of Request and Receipt Forms, Reports, Lists, Records, and Other Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also sets standards for the retention of request and receipt forms, reports, lists, records, and
other documents. PDMA requires the retention of certain records for not less than 3 years. FDA believes that, with
one exception, the 3-year minimum requirement should be extended to all records created and maintained under the
statute and the proposed rule to ensure efficient enforcement and compliance operations. Accordingly, the proposal
would state that any person required to create or maintain forms, reports, lists, or other records under the statute
or regulations would have to retain them for at least 3 years after the date of their creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that a more stringent standard is necessary for the retention of records relating to drug sample
distribution because some drug samples are relatively stable and may remain unexpired even though 3 or more years
may have elapsed since they were packaged and shipped. Accordingly, the proposal would require that forms, reports,
or records relating to the distribution of drug samples be retained for at least 3 years after the date of the record's
creation or the date of expiration of a drug sample for which the record is being kept, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Availability of Forms, Reports, Lists, and Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forms, reports, lists, or other records are of little value to FDA or other regulatory and law enforcement agencies,
unless they are readily available for inspection and copying. Accordingly, the proposal would compel any person
required to create or maintain forms, reports, lists, or other records under PDMA, PDA, or the proposed rule to make
them available upon request, in a form that permits copying or other means of duplication, to FDA or other Federal,
State, or local regulatory and law enforcement officials for review and reproduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Signatures on Forms, Reports, or Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By affixing a signature to a document, the person who signs it is giving his or her personal verification of the validity
of a document. For example, by affixing a signature to a drug sample request form, the person signing it attests to the
fact that he or she is a licensed practitioner and that he or she has requested delivery of a specific amount and type
of drug sample. Similarly, a signature on a receipt verifies the delivery of the drug samples to the licensed practitioner
or to the pharmacy of a hospital or other health care entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has preliminarily concluded that a valid signature need not be made by pen or indelible pencil on a piece of paper.
Instead, the agency believes that in certain circumstances a valid signature can be created and recorded by electronic
means.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under proposed &sect;203.61 a verifiable signature may be made by use of a writing or marking instrument
such as a pen, indelible pencil, or electronic stylus on electronic pad. Because some imprinting or copying devices
can be used to forge or falsely imprint a signature, and because false signatures and forgeries could be an integral
part of a drug diversion scheme, the proposal would prohibit imprinting or automatic reproduction of a signature
by a device or machine such as a stamp, copier, or autopen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;203.61 would establish performance standards and special security requirements for signatures
signed on electronic media. Proposed &sect;203.61(b) would require that if electronic media are used to execute
and record signatures, it must be installed and operated with: (1) A system permitting visual review of the signature;
(2) a system to detect or inhibit entry of a forged, traced, fraudulent, or counterfeit signature, i.e., authentication
software; and (3) a mechanism that blocks alteration of documents or signatures after the signatures are made, i.e.,
a locking device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons interested in commenting on electronic records and electronic signatures should be aware that an agency
task force, the FDA Electronic Identification/Signature Working Group, is currently assessing issues relating
to electronic signatures and recordkeeping. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32185), FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) entitled ``Electronic
Identification/Signatures; Electronic Records; Request for Information and Comments.'' The notice stated that
the agency is considering whether it should propose regulations that would, under certain circumstances, accept
electronic signatures in place of handwritten signatures where signatures are currently required in Title 21 of
the Code of Federal Regulations and is asking for comments on any related issues. Comments were to be identified with
Docket No. 92N&hyph;0251. The working group has reviewed the comments in the docket and the agency is considering
additional action. The agency's emerging position on electronic signatures and records will be coordinated with
the final PDMA policies requirements and administrative procedures rule. Suggestions on electronic signatures
and other signature substitutes and surrogates made to FDA in response to this proposed rule will also be made available
to the working group force for its review.

G. Penalties and Rewards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Criminal Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most violations of the act are punishable as misdemeanors, except that a violation committed after a prior conviction,
or a violation committed with the intent to defraud or mislead, is punishable as a felony. In addition, FDA advises
that persons who knowingly make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or knowingly
make or use any false writing or document, in any matter within the jurisdiction of a Federal department or agency;
who engage in mail fraud or wire fraud; or who otherwise obstruct agency regulatory activities may be subject to prosecution
under Title 18 of the United States Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most PDMA violations are felonies punishable by a prison term of not more than 10 years, a fine of not more than $250,000,
or both. Felonies under PDMA include the knowing importation of a drug in violation of section 801(d)(1) of the act;
the knowing sale, purchase, or trade of a drug or drug sample, or the knowing offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug
or drug sample in violation of section 503(c)(1) of the act; the knowing sale, purchase, or trade of a drug coupon; the
knowing offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug coupon, or the knowing counterfeiting of such a coupon in violation
of section 503(c)(2) of the act; or the knowing distribution of drugs in violation of section 503(e)(2)(A) of the act.
Misdemeanors include the distribution of a drug sample in violation of section 503(d) of the act and the failure to
comply with the ``pedigree'' requirement of section 503(e)(1)(A) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Civil Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PDMA also includes provisions for civil penalties for certain violations of the drug sample distribution requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer or distributor who distributes drug samples by means other than mail or common carrier, whose representative,
in the course of his or her employment, violates the PDMA prohibition against the sale, purchase, or trade or offer
to sell, purchase, or trade drug samples, or any State law prohibiting the sale, purchase, or trade or offer to sell,
purchase, or trade drug samples, is, upon conviction of the representative, subject to civil penalties as follows:
(1) A civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each of the first two such violations resulting in a conviction of any
representative of the manufacturer or distributor in any 10-year period; and (2) a civil penalty of not more than $1,000,000
for each violation resulting in a conviction of any representative after the second conviction in any 10-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer or distributor who fails to report to FDA any conviction of one of its representatives for violations
of section 503(c)(1) of the act or any State law that prohibits the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample (or the offer
to sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30680), FDA published a proposed rule on procedures for administrative hearings on civil money
penalties, including penalties under PDMA. FDA published a correction to this proposal in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Rewards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7 of PDMA (section 303(b)(5) of the act) provides that a person who provides information leading to the institution
of a criminal proceeding against, and conviction of, a person for the sale, purchase, or trade of a drug sample, or the
offer to sell, purchase, or trade a drug sample in violation of section 503(c)(1) of the act, is entitled to one-half
of the criminal fine imposed and collected for such violation, but not more than $125,000. The proposed rule provides
in &sect;203.70 that an application for such a reward be made to the Director, Office of Compliance, of the appropriate
Center.

H. Technical Amendment to State Licensing Guideline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a technical amendment to the storage and handling requirements of the State licensing guideline
at &sect;205.50(c) to clarify the agency's intention that the paragraph require that prescription drugs be stored
at appropriate temperatures in accordance with the requirements of the 22d edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.
XXII), the current edition of that compendium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the principles set out in the Executive Order.
In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the requirements in this proposed rule have already been implemented by the regulated industry in response
to PDMA's enactment, FDA's guidance, and industry trade associations' recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory costs of this proposal, which are due to increased paperwork requirements, were calculated by multiplying
an estimate of the time necessary to complete the paperwork for each section by an hourly wage rate of $44.99. The agency
estimates that nonprofit health care organizations (hospitals and charitable organizations) will require roughly
76,100 hours to complete the paperwork, at a cost of just over $3.4 million (76,000 hours X $44.99) annually. Pharmaceutical
manufacturers and distributors will need about 476,000 hours to comply with the paperwork requirements, at a cost
of around $21.4 million (476,000 hours X $44.99) annually. In total, therefore, the industry will utilize 552,000
hours (76,000 + 476,000) and spend approximately $24.8 million (3.4 million + 21.4 million) to complete the paperwork
requirements. Further details for these estimates are included with the agency's paperwork reduction package,
prepared pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Most of the requirements in this proposed rule have already been implemented by
the regulated industry, including small entities, in response to PDMA's enactment, FDA's guidance, and industry
trade association recommendations. Consequently, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no
further analysis is required.

IV. Executive Order 12612: Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires Federal agencies to examine carefully regulatory actions to determine if they would
have a significant impact on federalism. Using the criteria and principles set forth in the Order, the agency has considered
the impact of this proposed rule on the States, on their relationship with the Federal government, and on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is publishing this proposed rule to set forth agency policies and requirements and provide administrative procedures,
information, and guidance for those sections of PDMA that are not related to State licensing of wholesale drug distributors.
Because enforcement of these sections of PDMA is a Federal responsibility, there should be little, if any, impact
on the States from this rule, if it is finalized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA certifies that it has examined this proposed rule. Because it has little, if any, effect on federalism issues,
as stated above, and because any effects are not significant, this proposed rule does not require an assessment under
Executive Order 12612.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend its food labeling regulations to modify the basis on which low-volume food products of small businesses are
exempted from the requirements for nutrition labeling. The proposed regulations will also establish a notification
procedure for small businesses to claim exemption for their qualifying food products. This proposal is in response
to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act Amendments of 1993 (the 1993 amendments).

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 8, 1990, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub L. 101&hyph;535) (the 1990 amendments)
was enacted. This new law amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One
of the most notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that they added section 403(q) to the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)). This
section provides that, with certain exceptions, a food_that is, both a food in conventional form and a dietary supplement
of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances_is misbranded unless its label or labeling
bears certain nutrition information (nutrition labeling). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 amendments, however, also provide an exemption from mandatory nutrition labeling for small businesses.
Section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[I]f a person offers food for sale and has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers which is not
more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers which is not more than
$50,000, the requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) [the provisions that establish the nutrition labeling
requirement] shall not apply with respect to food sold by such person to consumers unless the label or labeling of food
offered by such person provides nutrition information or makes a nutrition claim.

In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60376), in a document entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily
Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision'' (hereinafter referred
to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal''), FDA proposed to reflect this provision of the 1990 amendments
in &sect;101.9(j)(1) of its regulations (21 CFR 101.9(j)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments to the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal stressed that the dollar exemption limits that FDA proposed
to implement in the 1990 amendments were too low. The comments argued that the sum of the analytical, printing, and
other costs of nutrition labeling are prohibitively expensive for low-volume products. FDA found that these comments
were persuasive, and that some adjustment to this exemption was necessary. Additionally, FDA participated in a series
of public forums that had been scheduled by the United States Department of Agriculture to discuss the small business
issue. These forums were held in May 1992 in Kansas City, MO; Atlanta, GA; and San Francisco, CA. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19410), FDA announced its participation in the public forums and requested comment on a number
of issues concerning exemption of food products of small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency compiled the information that it received in response to the notice and at the public forums. This information
helped form the basis for the agency's ``Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the Regulations Implementing
the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990'' (Ref. 1). FDA announced the public availability of this analysis
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36205). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In adopting the exemption for food labeled by small businesses in its final rule on nutrition labeling of January 6,
1993, entitled ``Food Labeling: Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision, Format for
Nutrition Label'' (58 FR 2079 at 2144) (hereinafter referred to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule''),
FDA stated that it was constrained by the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act. Therefore, the agency adopted
the exemption for small business, as it had proposed the exemption, as part of the mandatory nutrition labeling final
rule in &sect;101.9(j)(1)(i). This exemption (as corrected on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 44063 at 44083)) states:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency established the same exemption in &sect;101.36(f)(1) (21 CFR 101.36(f)(1)) for dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals in a final rule entitled ``Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition Labeling for
Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, or Other Similar Nutritional Substances'' that it published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 354) (hereinafter referred to as ``the dietary supplement final rule''). Under that final
rule, &sect;101.9(j)(1) applies to dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances manufactured,
packed, or distributed by small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At about the same time that FDA published the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule, a number of small businesses
and the trade associations that represent them made a concerted effort to bring their concerns about the exemption
from nutrition labeling for food products of small businesses and about their problems in meeting the requirements
of the new law to the attention of Congress. In response to these concerns, a bill was introduced and passed to provide
relief to small businesses. In presenting this bill for consideration in Congress, Congressman Dingell noted that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the last two years, it has become evident that, unfortunately, the NLEA exemption for small businesses was too
limited. It became clear that many small food businesses simply could not comply with the law's requirements in the
timeframe allowed. Some very small businesses may have great difficulty complying at all. Concerns about this matter
have been raised to FDA's attention and ours. They are legitimate concerns and they should be addressed. The bill we
are introducing today addresses companies with small numbers of employees and products sold in relatively small
quantities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments will provide greatly needed help to small businesses for whom a more realistic deadline for NLEA
compliance is essential. Small specialty food manufacturers and retail confectioners, many of whom rely on low-volume
sales of seasonal products, will be able to spread the cost of product analysis and printing over a 2- or 3-year period.
This literally will allow them to stay in business. According to the Retail Confectioners Association, for example,
a 1-year delay in NLEA implementation saves hundreds of millions of dollars.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(139 Congressional Record E 2016 (August 5, 1993).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 13, 1993, the President signed the 1993 amendments into law (Pub. L. 103&hyph;80). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 amendments establish a new exemption for low-volume food products that will be available to manufacturers,
packers, and distributors based on the number of people that they employ. In creating this new exemption, Congress
was responding to the information presented to it that: (1) It can cost several thousand dollars to change the label
of a food product to bring it into compliance with the requirements for nutrition labeling; (2) many small businesses
simply cannot comply with the requirements within the time frames allowed; and (3) the cost of complying with the nutrition
labeling requirements will be prohibitive for small businesses with a low volume of products at low profits (Refs.
2 through 4). By providing additional time before low-volume food products of small businesses must conform with
the requirements for nutrition labeling, the 1993 amendments will permit small firms to use up stocks of labels, thereby
reducing the costs of label inventory disposal, and to avoid having to compete for design and printing resources with
larger firms. By providing that food produced by firms having fewer than 100 employees and selling fewer than 100,000
units of a food product will not have to be nutrition labeled (at least until 2002), the 1993 amendments save such firms
the expense of nutrient analysis and preparation of new labels for those products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new provisions, persons that claim an exemption for a low-volume food product must file with FDA an annual
notice claiming the exemption, with the first such notice due by May 7, 1994 (section 403 (q)(5)(E)(iii) of the act),
that is, before the first 12-month period during which the nutrition labeling regulations will be in effect. Although
the filing of the notice is necessary for an exemption, the agency notes that, under section 403 (q)(5)(E)(i)(I) and
(q)(5)(E)(ii) of the act, a product would not be exempt if its labeling provides nutrition information or bears a nutrient
content or health claim.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement that the labeling of a product not include nutrition information creates an anomalous result. FDA
is aware that a number of small businesses market low-volume food products whose labeling bears nutrition information
in accord with the pre-1990 amendment nutrition labeling requirements of the agency's regulations. Because such
products bear nutrition information, they would not be eligible for the exemption in section 403(q)(5)(E). Such
a result makes little sense under the 1993 amendments, however; small firms with low-volume products, to which Congress
was attempting to provide some relief, would be penalized for having provided nutrition information, exactly what
Congress was trying to encourage, in the past. Such firms would be presented with the choice of either removing the
nutrition information from the labeling of eligible products, which would impose costs that Congress was trying
to protect these firms from having to expend, or marketing misbranded products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is considering providing relief in such cases under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;101.9(g)(9). Under this section of its regulations, FDA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with a situation when it is not technologically
feasible, or some other circumstance that makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with the requirements for nutritional
labeling in &sect;101.9(c). FDA is currently limiting the permission that it grants for alternative means of compliance
or additional exemptions in response to requests under &sect;101.9(g)(9) to those cases that involve technological
problems. However, based upon the comments that it receives in response to this proposal, FDA will consider whether
the cost to a small business of changing the labeling of a low-volume food product in response to the 1993 amendments
represents a circumstance that makes it impracticable for the firm to comply with the requirements of &sect;101.9(c)
and for which FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or provide an exemption. FDA will consider modifying
&sect;101.9(g)(9) in such a manner as it finds appropriate based on consideration of comments, to accommodate this
situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the regulations implementing the 1993 amendments are in place as close as possible to May 8, 1994, the
date of applicability for the nutrition labeling regulations, FDA is proposing that any final rule that may issue
in response to this proposal become effective upon its publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency believes that it is in the public interest to have a final rule in place as quickly as possible so that people
will know exactly what they must do to claim the exemption and to minimize the possibility that eligible firms will
fail to file their claims for exemption in a timely manner. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that there is good
cause to dispense with the normal 30-day period between publication of a final rule and its effective date. Given the
small amount of time before May 8, 1994, however, FDA recommends that persons that want to file notices with FDA to claim
the small business exemption follow the procedures proposed below.

II. The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Application of Existing Small Business Exemption From Nutrition Labeling Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing the regulations that provide exemptions for foods labeled by small businesses, i.e., &sect;101.9(j)(1)
for foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances
and &sect;101.36(f)(1) for dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, FDA interpreted the 1990 amendments as
applying to food offered for sale by manufacturers, packers, and distributors. However, the Statement of Explanation
for H.R. 2900 (the bill that became the 1993 amendments) states that this interpretation was an inappropriate extension
of the law: ``[T]he statutory language provides that this exemption applies only to retailers (`person[s who] offer[]
food *&blank;*&blank;* to consumers').'' (139 Congressional Record H6358 (August 6, 1993).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that manufacturers, packers, and distributors may have reasonably relied on the small business exemption
provided in &sect;101.9(j)(1), Congress, in section 2(a)(1) of the 1993 amendments, provided that the exemption
in section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act will continue to be available until May 7, 1995, in accordance with the regulation,
that is, based on gross sales made or business done to the consumer by manufacturers, packers, and distributors that
do not sell directly to the consumer. Section 2(a)(2) of the 1993 amendments further provides that after May 8, 1995,
this exemption will only be available with respect to food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to modify &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(1) and 101.36(f), consistent with the provisions of section 2(a)
of the 1993 amendments, to establish May 7, 1995, as the date after which the exemption provided in section 403(q)(5)(D)
of the act will not be available to food labeled by manufacturers, packers, and distributors but will only be available
to food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers. The agency is revising the numbering of &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(1)
and 101.36(f) to accommodate the proposed modifications.

B. New Small Business Exemption From Nutrition Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 amendments added new section 403(q)(5)(E) to the act. This section provides an exemption for low-volume
food products of small businesses from the mandatory nutrition labeling requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2)
of the act. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.9(j) by adding a new paragraph (j)(18) to reflect this exemption. Under
proposed &sect;101.9(j)(18), qualification for the exemption for a low-volume food product is based on four factors:
(1) The number of units of that food product sold in the United States; (2) the average number of full-time equivalent
employees of the person claiming the exemption, e.g., the firm or corporation; (3) the absence of other nutrition
information or nutrition claims in the labeling for that food product; and (4) the timely filing with FDA of a notice
claiming the exemption. FDA is also proposing similar revisions to &sect;101.36(f) to provide this exemption from
the requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act for low-volume food products that are dietary supplements
of vitamins or minerals.

1. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this regulation, FDA is proposing in &sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(A), (j)(18)(vi)(B), and (j)(18)(vi)(C)
(and also &sect;101.36 (f)(2)(vi)(A), (f)(2)(vi)(B), and (f)(2)(vi)(C)) to adopt, with minor changes, the definitions
for ``unit,'' ``food product,'' and ``person'' respectively, as established by the 1993 amendments in section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)
of the act. Also, the agency is proposing a definition for the term ``average number of full-time equivalent employees''
in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(D) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency is proposing to define in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(A) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv)(A) the term ``unit''
to mean ``the packaging or, if there is no packaging, the form in which a food product is offered for sale to the consumer.''
This definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(I) of the act. Consistent with this definition, any completely
labeled package such as a can, bottle, box, or bag of a food product that is presented for sale to the consumer is a unit
of that product. Thus, for example, for soft drinks, a 12-pack or a 24-pack of 12-ounce (oz) cans that are fully labeled
would represent 12 or 24 units, respectively, of that soft drink because each can is in a form in which it can be offered
for sale to the consumer. On the other hand, in the case of a package containing six 4-oz containers of pudding, the individual
containers of which are not completely labeled (i.e., it complies with the provisions of &sect;101.9(j)(15)), the
package of six would constitute one unit. The difference between these two examples is that in the second case, the
packaging of the product, as it is presented to the consumer, is as an individual unit of six containers (a multiunit
retail food package), whereas in the first instance, the 12-pack or 24-pack is a convenience used by the manufacturer
to deliver 12 or 24 individual units of the product to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that there also may be occasions where a food product is sold in bulk or in individual pieces rather
than in packaging; e.g., flour may be sold from bulk containers in a grocery store. Such products are not exempt from
nutrition labeling but must have the nutrition information provided on the bulk container from which the food is dispensed
(&sect;&sect;101.9(j)(16) and 101.36(g)). Under the proposed definition for ``unit,'' a person will have to determine
the number of units of product sold in the United States not in packaging on the basis of the typical sales practice for
the food product. For example, if 2,000 pounds of flour are sold from bulk displays at grocery stores, and the typical
practice for sales to consumers is to price the flour on a per pound basis, then the bulk sales would represent 2,000
units.

To be eligible for an exemption from the provisions of &sect;&sect;101.9 or 101.36, as discussed in more detail below,
the total number of units of a product sold in all of its forms (i.e., various sizes) must be less than the applicable
number of units for the exemption. For example, a firm may manufacture a beverage in 10-oz bottles, 12-oz cans, 16-oz
bottles, 1-liter (L) bottles, and 2&hyph;L bottles. In determining whether the beverage would be eligible for an
exemption, the firm would total the number of units of each of the various sizes of containers sold in the United States,
and if the total number of units for all five types of packages is less than the applicable amount, e.g., less than 600,000
in the case of proposed &sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(A), then the beverage would be eligible for exemption.

 The agency is proposing to define in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(B) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(B) the terms ``food
product'' and ``food product that is a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals'' to mean ``food in any sized package
which is manufactured by a single manufacturer or which bears the same brand name, which bears the same statement of
identity, and which has similar preparation methods.'' This definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(II)
of the act. Whether two units of a food are units of the same food product or are units of different food products for the
purposes of proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(f)(2) depends on how they compare under the factors listed
in this definition. If two units of a food are the same under each of these three factors, then they would represent two
units of the same food product. However, if the two units of a food differ in one or more respects under these three factors,
then they would represent one unit of two different food products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the terms ``single manufacturer'' and ``same brand name'' are self-explanatory, the agency believes that
it is useful to provide more detail on the terms ``statement of identity'' and ``similar method of preparation'' and
to provide some examples of the relationship between units and food products. In discussing the definition for statement
of identity, the Statement of Explanation for H.R. 2900 explains that by statement of identity, it intended that FDA
use the definition of ``statement of identity'' in its regulations under &sect;101.3(b) (21 CFR 101.3(b)) (139 Congressional
Record H6358 (August 6, 1993)). Section 101.3(b) provides that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence
thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the
public for such food.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, under proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(f)(2), in determining whether a food is the same food
product as another food for determining the number of units sold, a firm should refer to &sect;101.3(b) to determine
whether the two foods have the same statement of identity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency interprets the term ``similar preparation methods'' to extend to all aspects in the manufacture of the
food product, from the initial steps of determining the ingredients to be used, i.e., formulation, to interim treatment
steps of the ingredients, such as blanching, to all of the various steps used in the processing of the finished food
to be sold to the consumer. Because each of these steps may have an effect on the nutrient content of the finished food
product, units of foods that differ with respect to particular steps in their manufacture should be considered by
a firm to constitute units of different food products for the purpose of its determining the approximate number of
units of food products sold in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency provides the following examples to describe the circumstances in which two units of a food would be two units
of the same food product, or, alternatively, one unit each of two different food products: A firm would count two units
of a food with the same statement of identity and similar methods of preparation as two units of the same product if they
both bear the same brand name even though they were manufactured by two different firms. A private label manufacturer
would have to count as units of the same food all production with the same statement of identity (presuming similar
method of preparation) even if it is packing the food products under the brand names of five different firms. On the
other hand, even if two units of food are made by the same firm (or have the same brand name) and have the same statement
of identity, they would not count as units of the same food product if there were differences in their method of preparation,
such that the nutrition profiles of the two products are different, (one ice cream product was made with nuts and the
other was not) or different manufacturing processes were used (e.g., one was canned while the other was frozen).

The agency is proposing to define in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(C) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(C) the term ``person''
to mean ``all domestic and foreign affiliates of the corporation, in the case of a corporation.'' This aspect of the
definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(III) of the act. FDA is also proposing to include within the coverage
of this term companies that are not corporations by including the following language in these regulations: ``*&blank;*&blank;*
and all affiliates of that firm or other entity, when referring to a firm or other entity that is not a corporation.''
Section 201(e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(e)) defines ``person'' as including an individual, partnership, corporation,
and association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1993 amendments, Congress clarified the definition of ``person'' to remove any ambiguity as to the entities
that a corporation should include in determining the average number of its full-time equivalent employees. Congress
said the employees of each of its affiliates should be counted by a corporation. The agency is proposing to include
the sentence noted above in its regulation to provide parallel coverage of persons that are not corporations.

The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(vi)(D) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(D) to define the term ``full-time
equivalent employee'' to mean all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption and to establish a formula
for use by a person to calculate the average number of its full-time equivalent employees. The agency is proposing
that the average number of full-time equivalent employees of a company be determined by dividing the total number
of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to a company by the number of hours of work in a year,
2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours &times; 52 weeks). Under this formula, a person would base the average number of full-time
equivalent employees on a typical work-year and on the total hours worked by individuals employed by the firm and,
as noted above, by all of its affiliates. The average number of full-time equivalent employees would be calculated
based on all employees of a firm, including production workers, office staff, salesmen, and distribution staff,
including any contract personnel. Under the proposed formula, a foreign firm, as well as a domestic firm, will have
to calculate the average number of its full-time equivalent employees based on the total numbers of individuals employed
by that firm and its affiliates, regardless of whether their operations are related to sales of food products in the
United States.

2. Small Business Food Labeling Exemption Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 amendments provide that the exemption contained in section 403(q)(5)(E) of the act shall only be available
to a person that files a notice with FDA to claim the exemption for one or more of its low-volume food products before
the beginning of the 12-month period during which the exemption is to be in effect. The agency is proposing requirements
concerning the filing of this notice in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv). In addition to the
name and address of the firm claiming exemption for certain of its food products, under the proposed regulations,
the notice must include the average number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm, and, for each food product
for which an exemption is claimed, the approximate number of units sold by the firm over the 12-month period preceding
the period for which the exemption is claimed. FDA intends to treat all information received in such notices in accordance
with its public information regulations, 21 CFR part 20, particularly &sect;20.61 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the filing of the notice establishing that a product meets the requirements for an exemption, the food product
will be exempt from the requirements for nutrition labeling specified in &sect;101.9 or &sect;101.36 during the
12-month period for which the exemption is claimed. There is no requirement for agency action, review, or approval
before the exemption is effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recognizing that a person is subject to criminal liability for submitting false information to the Federal Government
(18 U.S.C. 1001), FDA is proposing to require that a notice of claimed small business exemption contain a signed certification
of the accuracy of the submission by a responsible individual for the company submitting the notice (proposed &sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv)(F)
and &sect;101.36(f)(2)(iv)(F). Additional information to support the validity of the information provided in
the notice may be required under section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act provides that a notice of a claimed small business exemption shall ``contain
such information'' as FDA (by delegation from the Secretary) may require ``to verify the information required''
about the number of full-time equivalent employees and unit sales of food products if the agency ``has questioned
the validity of such information.'' Because the notice cannot include information that FDA has not yet required_that
is, that FDA has not yet identified as necessary to verify the information in the notice_a two-step process is necessary
to implement this provision. The agency must first review the notice and decide whether any verifying information
is necessary and then be given access to that information. The agency is considering defining in this rulemaking the
procedure through which it will obtain the verifying information that the statute clearly states that it may require.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information in the notice could be verified either by requiring the submission of supporting documentation or by
inspecting that documentation at a firm's place of business. In some circumstances, inspection of records will be
more practicable than submission, and vice versa. FDA is thus considering requiring that any company that claims
the small business exemption provide the agency with access to its records that support the information contained
in the exemption notice if the agency finds that such access is necessary to verify the information contained in the
notice. In some situations, the agency may instead require the submission of supporting information to the agency.
FDA tentatively finds that it has ample legal authority to impose these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)), FDA has the authority to adopt by regulation requirements that
are necessary for the efficient enforcement of the act, including section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act. (See

569 F.2d 690, 693 &amp; n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1978).) Implementing section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act through the
sole method of requiring submission of verifying information to the agency could be unduly burdensome for both the
agency and the companies claiming the small business exemption. For example, the agency could determine, under section
403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act, that information in a particular notice must be verified by examining a firm's
payroll records and invoices. Copying all of these documents and submitting them to the agency could present difficulty
for a small business claiming the exemption. This difficulty could be avoided if FDA examined the relevant documents
at the firm's premises. Moreover, verifying the information contained in notice of claimed exemption by inspecting
documents at the firm's place of business, and copying only those needed, would in many cases be a more efficient use
of the agency's investigational resources. This approach is consistent with FDA's actions in other areas where it
has required that records be made available to agency employees. (See, e.g., 21 CFR 108.25(g) (acidified foods);
108.35(h) (thermal processing of low-acid foods); 172.320 (amino acids).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency points out that its contemplated approach is fully consistent with Congress' desire, as reflected in the
legislative history of the 1993 amendments, that the small business exemption be obtained in a simple and straightforward
manner without complicated reporting. (See 139 Congressional Record E 2016 (August 5, 1993) (statement of Rep. Dingell)
(``The system is a simple one that does not require complicated reporting or a response from FDA.''); see also 139 Cong.
Rec. S 10817 (August 6, 1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (The 1993 amendments ``provide[] a straightforward system
under which a company simply notifies the FDA that one or more of its products qualify for an exemption''); id. at S 10818
(statement of Sen. Hatch).) Under the approach that the agency is considering, a company would merely have to file
a simple notice with the agency. It would then be up to the agency to determine whether any matter needs verification
and to take steps to view the documentation required to verify the relevant information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA requests comments on the approach described above. Based on its review of the comments, the agency may provide
in the final rule that companies claiming the exemption will be required to permit inspection of supporting documentation
or to submit any required information to the agency, as appropriate. Given the late date of this proposal, however,
the agency would not make these requirements effective for notices of exemption for 1994&hyph;95. Many small firms,
in contemplation of the fact that most small businesses must file a notice, have already filed notices without any
indication from the agency as to how it intends to enforce the implementation requirements. Because FDA believes
that people should have full notice of the requirements that will apply to them when they file a notice of exemption,
and because requiring small firms to refile based on any final rule would significantly undercut the efficient enforcement
purposes of a records access requirement, FDA would make these requirements applicable to notices seeking exemption
beginning with the period from May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996. Nevertheless, companies filing for an exemption would still
be subject to the statutory requirement in section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii)(IV) of the act, and, although the procedural
requirements for complying with this section would not be effective until 1995, companies should still be prepared
to provide information to FDA to support their notices of exemption should FDA question the validity of any information
contained in those notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflecting new section 403(q)(5)(E)(iii) of the act, the agency is providing in proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv)
and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) that a firm that is not an importer and that has an average of fewer than 10 full-time equivalent
employees does not have to file notice for any product for which it has sales of less than 10,000 units in any year for
it to be eligible for the small business exemption for that product. The agency would suggest, however, that such a
company submit a notice to the Office of Food Labeling (HFS&hyph;150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, to establish a record that it is claiming a small
business exemption for some or all of its products. (The Office of Food Labeling is the office within FDA that has responsibility
for food labeling issues.) The agency intends to make available to FDA and State enforcement offices a list of the names
and addresses of firms that have claimed the small business exemption and the names of the products for which they have
claimed the exemption. The agency intends to include on this list the names of firms that have fewer than 10 employees
and sales of fewer than 10,000 units of a particular product. Such firms are not required to file a notice but can choose
to do so voluntarily. FDA believes that the appearance of a product's name on the list will eliminate any questions
about its eligibility for an exemption. Thus, even though not required, the submission of a notice of a claimed small
business exemption for a food product may be in the best interest of a firm. FDA also intends to include in the list the
names of firms eligible for the small business exemption provided in &sect;&sect;101.109(j)(1)(i) and 101.36(f)(2)(i)
if they file notice with the Office of Food Labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All notices must be filed by May 7, 1994, for the 12-month period beginning May 8, 1994, the date that the new mandatory
nutrition labeling regulations become effective. The notice is to be filed with the Office of Food Labeling (address
above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that time is growing short for the filing of notices to FDA, and that firms may be anxious to file the notice
for claimed exemption. As an interim measure and to assure that all necessary information is submitted, FDA suggests
that firms follow the procedures proposed in this document if they file a notice with FDA before the agency issues final
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it has received numerous inquiries as to whether a form exists for the submission of the notice, FDA is providing
in Appendix I of this document, a model form, along with instructions for completing it in Appendix II of this document.
This model form may be used by firms to supply notice of their claimed exemptions. FDA advises, however, that it is not
necessary to use this form. The agency also advises that the small business exemption for a food product will be in effect
once a notice has been filed with FDA, even though it may be necessary for the Office of Food Labeling to work with the
firm that is filing the notice to address deficiencies in the notice. Although no action by the agency is required,
FDA will attempt to review all notices to ensure that they are complete and to notify companies of the receipt of the
notice, and whether additional information needs to be submitted.

3. Eligibility for the Small Business Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposed &sect;&sect;101.9 (j)(18)(i) and (j)(18)(ii) and in 101.36 (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii), FDA is incorporating
into its regulations the statutory limits on the number of units sold that would qualify a food product as a low-volume
food product eligible for exemption from the nutrition labeling requirements established by section 403(q)(1)
and (q)(2) of the act. Proposed &sect;&sect;101.9 (j)(18)(i) and (j)(18)(ii) and 101.36 (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii)
also reflect the statutory limits on a firm's average number of full-time equivalent employees that would qualify
it as a small business whose products are eligible for an exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act provides for phased-in coverage of foods that were first introduced into interstate commerce before May 8,
1994. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(I) of the act, a food product is eligible for exemption from the nutrition labeling
requirements from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, if fewer than 600,000 units of that product were sold in the United States
between May 8, 1993, and May 7, 1994, and the person claiming the exemption for that product employed fewer than an average
of 300 full-time equivalent employees during that time. The agency recognizes that there are some products that will
have come onto the market before May 8, 1994, for which there will not be a full year of sales on which to determine whether
they qualify for an exemption as a low-volume food. The agency is proposing that a food for which there is not 12 months
of sales before May 8, 1994, will qualify as a low-volume food eligible for an exemption if the sales of the food during
the period in which the exemption will apply, May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, are reasonably anticipated to be less than
600,000 units. This treatment of products sold before May 8, 1994, but without a full year of sales history before that
date, is consistent with that of products not sold in the 12-month period before an exemption is claimed under section
403(q)(5)(E)(i)(IV) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to provide for this exemption in &sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(A). The agency notes that this proposed
provision is not applicable to dietary supplements of herbs and other similar nutritional substances, and that FDA
is not proposing to include a parallel provision in &sect;101.36(f) for dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals,
because the mandatory labeling requirements do not become effective for dietary supplements until July 1, 1995.

Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(II) of the act, the exemption for a food first introduced into interstate commerce

continue to be eligible for exemption from nutrition labeling between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, only if there were
fewer than 400,000 units of that product sold in the United States between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, and if the firm
that claims an exemption for the product employed an average of fewer than 300 full-time equivalent employees during
that period. The agency is proposing to reflect this provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(B) and 101.36(f)(2)(i)(A)
of its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption narrows even further in the third year. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(ii)(III) of the act, a food introduced
into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, is eligible for exemption from the requirements for nutrition labeling
between May 8, 1996, and May 7, 1997, if there were fewer than 200,000 units of that food product sold in the United States,
and if the firm that claims an exemption for such product employed an average of less than 200 full-time equivalent
employees, between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996. The agency is proposing to reflect this provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(i)(C)
and 101.36(f)(2)(i)(B) of its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i) of the act, all other food products are eligible for exemption from the requirements
for nutrition labeling in section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act for any 12-month period if there were fewer than 100,000
units of that food product sold in the United States during the preceding 12 months by the firm claiming the exemption,
and if that firm employed an average of less than 100 full-time equivalent employees during that preceding 12-month
period. Under section 403(q)(5)(E)(i) of the act, newly marketed food is eligible for exemption if fewer than 100,000
units of that food product are reasonably anticipated to be sold, and if the firm claiming the exemption employs an
average of less than 100 full-time equivalent employees, during the 12-month period for which the exemption is claimed.
The agency is proposing to reflect these provisions in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(ii) and 101.36(f)(2)(ii) of its
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, the proposed regulations will operate in the following way: A person with an average of 250 full-time equivalent
employees between May 8, 1993, and May 8, 1994, may file a notice with FDA claiming an exemption from the requirements
of &sect;101.9 for the period from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, for each of its products whose sales were less than 600,000
units during the period from May 8, 1993, to May 7, 1994. The filing of the notice will serve to establish the exemption
for the food product (assuming no nutrition information or health or nutrient content claims are provided in the labeling
of the product). If a product were not offered for sale for the entire year preceding May 8, 1994, the firm could claim
a small business exemption for that food product if the number of units of that product sold in the United States during
the time period from May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, is reasonably anticipated to be fewer than 600,000 units.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If that firm continues to have less than 300 employees, e.g., 275 full-time equivalent employees, for the period of
May 8, 1994, to May 7, 1995, it may file by May 7, 1995, a new notice to claim an exemption for the period from May 8, 1995,
to May 7, 1996, for any product for which it sold less than 400,000 units in the United States during the period of May
8, 1994, to May 7, 1995 and where labeling does not bear nutrition information or health or nutrient content claims.
However, if the firm continues to have more than 200 full-time equivalent employees for the time period of May 8, 1995,
to May 7, 1996, the firm will not be eligible to claim a small business exemption for its products after May 8, 1996. Under
section 403(q)(5)(E)(iv) of the act, within 18 months after that date, it will have to bring the labels of its products
into compliance with the provisions of &sect;&sect;101.9 and 101.36. On the other hand, a firm with less than 200 full-time
equivalent employees during the period of May 8, 1995, to May 7, 1996, e.g., 175 employees, would be eligible to file
a notice by May 7, 1996, to claim a small business exemption for the time period May 8, 1996, to May 7, 1997, for any product
that was on the market before May 8, 1994, and of which it sold fewer than 200,000 units during the period of May 8, 1995,
to May 7, 1996. Only those firms having less than 100 full-time equivalent employees would be able to file a notice to
claim a small business exemption for a 12-month period after May 8, 1997, and then only for products having approximate
annual sales of less than 100,000 units.

Under proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(ii) and 101.36(f)(2)(ii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a person that is planning to introduce a new food product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into interstate commerce effective August 1, 1994, (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after May 8, 1994) and that has, for example, an average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 50 full-time equivalent employees (during the period of August 1, 1993, to August 1, 1994) may file a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FDA by July 31, 1994, claiming an exemption for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product from the requirements of &sect;&sect;101.9 or 101.36 for the period from August 1, 1994, until July 31, 1995,
if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably anticipates selling fewer than 100,000 units of that product during the period from August 1, 1994, to
July 31, 1995. As discussed above, the filing of the notice serves to establish the exemption for the food product.
If the firm continues to have less than 100 employees, e.g., only 55 full-time equivalent employees, and continues
to sell less than 100,000 units of the product in the United States, the firm will be able to annually claim an exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iii) and 101.36(f)(2)(iii), consistent with the provisions
of section 403(q)(5)(E)(iv) of the act, that a small business exemption for a product shall expire 18 months after
the date on which the average number of full-time equivalent employees or number of units of food products sold in the
United States exceed the numbers necessary for a food to be eligible for an exemption. For example, under the provisions
of proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iii) and 101.36(f)(2)(iii), an exemption for a low-volume food product
for the time period between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, expires 18 months after the date on which sales of that food product
exceed 600,000 units, or the average number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm claiming the exemption
exceeds 300. Alternatively, the exemption shall expire 18 months after the ending date of the 12-month period that
the food product was exempt under &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) or 101.36(f)(2). This provision will provide to a small
business approximately the same amount of time after the eligibility for exemption ends that firms that did not qualify
for a small business exemption had to bring the labels of their products into compliance with section 403(q) of the
act after the publication of final rules implementing that section of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) to require that the certification
statement include a commitment on the part of the person claiming an exemption that he or she will notify FDA if the number
of units of a food product sold, or the average number of full-time equivalent employees employed, by the person exceeds
the applicable numbers. Having made such a commitment, a failure to notify the agency that the food is no longer eligible
would subject the person to action under Title 18 of the United States Code.

4. Modification of Exemption Eligibility Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 403(q)(5)(E)(v) of the act provides that FDA may by regulation lower the requirements pertaining to the average
number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of food products requirements for eligibility for
exemption for any food product first introduced into interstate commerce after May 8, 2002. Under the act, before
FDA can lower these requirements, it must determine that the cost of compliance with the lower requirements will not
place an undue burden on persons that would be affected by the lower requirements. FDA is proposing to reflect this
provision in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(v) and 101.36(f)(2)(v) of its regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic impact of the proposed rule as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives
and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential
economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
The agency finds that the only significant economic effect of this rule is the benefit that it creates by reducing labeling
costs for newly exempted companies. This benefit is the result of statutory provisions and not FDA discretion. However,
because this benefit is large and affects small businesses, we are providing the following voluntary economic impact
analysis and regulatory flexibility analysis that meet the requirements of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two types of costs in this regulation: (1) Costs to comply with the notification requirement, and (2) costs
of lost nutrition benefits. FDA estimates that the volume of food products produced by manufacturers, packers, or
distributors eligible for the exemption being proposed in &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18) and 101.36(f)(2) constitutes
less than 1 percent of the U.S. diet. Thus, any lost nutrition benefits are likely to be small. The 1993 amendments require
that any small firm (except for very small firms with very low-volume food products) that has low-volume food products
that are eligible for exemption from nutrition labeling notify FDA of the volume of sales of such products and the number
of its full-time equivalent employees if the product is to be exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some firms will not have products that are eligible for the new small business exemption, and some will not take advantage
of the exemption from nutrition labeling for one of the following reasons: (1) They make nutrient content claims,
(2) they make health claims, (3) they decide to label to be competitive with other labeled products, or (4) retailers
they sell to insist on nutrition labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that 50 percent of all firms that could claim the small business exemption will decide not to do so for one of
the reasons listed above and will, as a result, provide nutrition labeling for their products, it is estimated that
approximately 4,500 firms will remain that have products that are eligible for exemption and not label their products
with nutrition labeling in the first 2 years during which nutrition labeling is required by &sect;&sect;101.9 and
101.36. The agency further estimates that this figure will reduce to 4,000 firms for the third year during which nutrition
labeling is required and to 3,200 firms for subsequent years. Those firms that choose not to label will be responsible
for annually gathering sales and employee data and notifying FDA of their claim for exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, firms will have to read and analyze the regulation. Second, they will have to determine the average number of
full-time equivalent employees they employed in the previous year. Because most firms keep payroll records of expenses
only, this will require some conversion. Third, firms will have to determine which of their products qualify for exemption.
Again, records of dollar sales are normally kept and, as prices may have changed throughout the year, some analysis
may be required for each product that the firm believes to be exempt. This activity may be reasonably expected to take
an average of 8 hours per firm although FDA solicits comment on this figure. If costs to perform this activity (plus
overhead) average approximately $46 per hour (the value used by FDA in calculating costs for reporting under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980), then the first year costs to firms that decide to file a notice of exception are expected to be
approximately $1,656,000. This cost will drop to approximately $1,472,000 and $1,177,640 in subsequent years as
the number of firms filing a notice decreases as discussed above. The proposed rule reflects the statute's removal
of coverage for manufacturers, packers, and distributors under the exemption based on gross value of sales or business
done after May 8, 1995. The agency believes that this will result in minimal cost to industry because almost all firms
that might have been covered by that exemption will be covered by the new exemption provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal costs for implementing the notification system in terms of setting up the system, handling mail, recording
firms and products, and providing information concerning exempted firms will approximate $207,000. Thus, it is
reasonable to expect that total costs of the notification provision will be less than $2 million for the first year
and decrease substantially in subsequent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of this regulation are likely to be very large. First, many small manufacturers noted the impossibility
of labeling their low-volume products in comments to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that the costs of labeling are about $3,000 per product and that there is an average of 20 products per firm,
cost savings from not labeling the products that are exempt are estimated to be between $275 million and $360 million.
In addition, this law and regulation prevent both the lost value to consumers of products that would no longer be available
and the costs of losing many small businesses.

IV. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24 (a)(8) and (a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually
or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment
nor an environmental impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed actions pertaining to food labeling meet the criteria in 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) for exclusion from preparation
of an environmental assessment and an environmental impact statement. The proposed regulations pertaining to the
small business notification procedure meet the criteria for exclusion described in 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8).

V. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule contains information collections that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Therefore, in accordance with 5 CFR part 1320, the
title, description, and respondent description of the information requirements are shown below with an estimate
of the annual collection and information burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering necessary information, and completion and submission of the request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides the procedures for the submission of a notice of a claim by a company of an exemption from
FDA's regulations for mandatory nutrition labeling. FDA action on the notice will be limited to review for completeness
and acknowledgement that the notice had been received and was or was not adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 amendments revise the basis for a small business exemption provided by section 403(q)(5) of the act. This
new provision, section 403(q)(5)(E) of the act, provides an exemption for a food product based on the number of employees
of the company and the number of units sold on an annual basis. Under the 1993 amendments, to qualify for an exemption,
a person must file the notice mentioned in the preceding paragraph with FDA before the time period for the claimed exemption.
Proposed &sect;&sect;101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) reflect the information identified in section 403(q)(5)(E)
of the act as necessary as part of the notice for a claimed small business exemption.

The agency expects that the number of respondents and corresponding annual burden hours will decrease over succeeding
years as the basis for additional exemptions changes. By May 1997, FDA estimates that approximately 3,200 companies
may be filing notices to claim the exemption with a corresponding annual burden hours of approximately 25,600 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has submitted copies of the proposed rule to OMB for its review of these recordkeeping requirements. Interested
persons are requested to send comments regarding this estimated burden, including suggestions for reducing this
burden to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above), and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer for FDA.

VI. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Because of the shortness of time until the date on which notices must be filed with the agency to claim the new exemptions,
FDA is proposing to make these regulations effective on the date of publication of the final rules in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As stated above, FDA tentatively concludes that it has good cause for this action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons may, on or before May 13, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the shortness of the time until firms must begin filing notice of claimed exemptions with the agency, FDA
will not be able to extend the comment period beyond that date. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is advising that it may not be able to consider any comments received at the Dockets Management Branch after
the close of business on May 13, 1994.
