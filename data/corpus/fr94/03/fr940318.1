<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is proposing to reduce user fees for cotton producers for cotton classification
services under the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act in accordance with the formula provided in the Uniform Cotton
Classing Fees Act of 1987, as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;237. The 1993 user fee for this classification service
was $1.87 per bale. This proposal would reduce the fee for the 1994 crop to $1.80 per bale. The proposed reduction in
fees is due to increased efficiency in classing operations and is sufficient to recover the costs of providing classification
services, including costs for administration, supervision, and standardization costs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule has been determined to be non-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore
has not been reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this proposal
on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesses subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be disproportionately burdened. The Administrator of AMS has certified that this action will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the RFA because: (1)
The fee reduction reflects a decrease in the cost-per-unit currently borne by those entities utilizing the services;
(2) the cost reduction will not affect competition in the marketplace; and (3) the use of classification services
is voluntary.

In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork

Fees for Classification Under the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act of 1927 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The user fee charged to cotton producers for High Volume Instrument (HVI) classification services under the Cotton
Statistics and Estimates Act (7 U.S.C. 473a) was $1.87 per bale during the 1993 harvest season as determined by using
the formula provided in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987 as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;237. The fees
cover salaries, cost of equipment and supplies, and other overhead costs, including costs for administration, supervision,
and standardization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule establishes the user fee charged to producers for High Volume Instrument (HVI) classification
at $1.80 per bale during the 1994 harvest season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;237 amended the formula in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987 for establishing the producer's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification fee so that the producer's fee is based on the prevailing method of classification requested by producers
during the previous year. HVI classing was the prevailing method of cotton classification requested by producers
in 1993. Therefore, the 1994 producer's user fee for classification service is based on the 1993 base fee for HVI classification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee was calculated by applying the formula specified in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987, as amended
by Public Law 102&hyph;237. The 1993 base fee for HVI classification exclusive of adjustments, as provided by the
Act, was $1.91 per bale. A 2.7 percent, or five cents per bale increase due to the implicit price deflator of the gross
domestic product added to the $1.91 would result in a 1994 base fee of $1.96 per bale. The formula in the Act provides
for the use of the percentage change in the implicit price deflator of the gross national product (as indexed for the
most recent 12-month period for which statistics are available). However, this has been replaced by the gross domestic
product by the Department of Commerce as a more appropriate measure for the short-term monitoring and analysis of
the U.S. economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of bales to be classed by the United States Department of Agriculture from the 1994 crop is estimated at 16,550,000.
The 1994 base fee was decreased 15 percent based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estimated number of bales to be classed (one percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every 100,000 bales or portion thereof above the base of 12,500,000, limited to a maximum adjustment of 15 percent).
This percentage factor amounts to a 29 cents per bale reduction and was subtracted from the 1994 base fee of $1.96 per
bale, resulting in a fee of $1.67 per bale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula requires addition of a five cents per bale surcharge to the $1.67 per bale fee since the projected operating
reserve would be less than 25 percent. The five cent surcharge would result in a 1994 season fee of $1.72 per bale. Assuming
a fee of $1.72, the projected operating reserve would be 6.6 percent. An additional 8 cents per bale would be required
to provide an ending accumulated operating reserve for the fiscal year of at least 10 percent of the projected cost
of operating the program. This would establish the 1994 season fee at $1.80 per bale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in &sect;28.909, paragraph (b) would be revised to reflect the reduction in the HVI classification
fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided for in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987, as amended, a five cent per bale discount would continue
to be applied to voluntary centralized billing and collecting agents as specified in &sect;28.909 (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Growers or their designated agents would continue to incur no additional fees if only one method of receiving classification
data was requested. The fee for each additional method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving classification data in &sect;28.910 would remain at five cents per bale, and it would be applicable even
if the same method was requested. The other provisions of &sect;28.910 concerning the fee for an owner receiving classification
data from the central database and the fee for new classification memoranda issued for the business convenience of
such an owner without reclassification of the cotton would remain the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee for review classification in &sect;28.911 would be reduced from $1.87 per bale to $1.80 per bale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee for returning samples after classification in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;28.911 would remain at 40 cents per sample.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR parts 160, 161, and 162 pertain to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS)
veterinary accreditation program. Through this program, APHIS authorizes veterinarians in private practice to
perform certain official services and duties on behalf of APHIS Veterinary Services officials. These responsibilities
include such activities as examining livestock for clinical signs of disease, vaccinating animals for brucellosis,
drawing and shipping blood for testing, and preparing health certificates required for domestic or international
movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 161.3 (hereafter referred to as the regulations) sets forth the standards for accredited veterinarian duties.
The regulations cover several requirements and prohibitions regarding the preparation of official forms, certificates,
records and reports. The regulations use the term ``sign.'' As used in the regulations, ``sign'' means that an accredited
veterinarian signs a document, in his or her own hand. However, ``sign'' is not defined in the regulations. This has
led to some confusion concerning the signature requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has always been APHIS's policy that only accredited veterinarians may sign official documents. Accredited veterinarians
may not authorize other persons, through power of attorney or other means, to sign official documents for them; neither
may accredited veterinarians use signature stamps or other mechanical devices to sign official documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several reasons, we believe it is crucial for accredited veterinarians themselves to personally sign official
documents. Perhaps the most important reason is the need to maintain the credibility of the veterinary accreditation
program with foreign animal health officials. The regulations authorize accredited veterinarians to prepare health
certificates for livestock destined for exportation; the regulations do not authorize any other individuals to
prepare export health certificates. If we allow accredited veterinarians to delegate authority to other persons
to sign export health certificates, foreign animal health officials could lose confidence in the integrity of the
veterinary accreditation program. This, in turn, could result in the loss of export markets for U.S. livestock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, to clarify the regulations, we are proposing to amend 9 CFR part 160 to add a definition of ``sign.'' The
proposed definition would clarify that accredited veterinarians may not delegate authority to sign documents,
whether through a power of attorney or other means. The proposed definition would also clarify that signature stamps
or other mechanical devices may not be used to sign documents in lieu of an accredited veterinarian's hand-inscribed
signature.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would provide eligibility for a 503 project in which a regulated financial institution is providing
the third party financing and is also the seller of the real estate being financed. A condition of eligibility would
be that the real estate being sold was previously acquired by the institution as ``other real estate owned'' (OREO)
as defined by the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). Until now, the rule has been that where any part of the permanent financing
is supplied by the seller of the property for the project, such financing must be subordinate to the 503/504 loan. This
proposed rule change would not require a regulated financial institution to take a subordinate position because
the institution is the seller under certain prescribed conditions. An independent appraisal of the value of the property
would be required, with the appraisal prepared by or under the control of the SBA or the participating Certified Development
Company (CDC). This proposed rule change will grant small businesses an opportunity to purchase OREO which is being
made available to purchasers with sufficient financial strength to meet the lenders' credit requirements under
FIRREA and FDICIA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By this proposed rule, 13 CFR 108.503&hyph;8(b)(2) would be amended to provide an exception to the restriction currently
set forth in the paragraph which provides that where any part of the permanent financing for a development company
project is supplied by the seller of the property for the project, such financing must be subordinate to the 503/504
loan. This proposed rule change would not require a regulated financial institution to take a subordinate position
if the institution is the seller, and if an independent appraisal of the value of the property prepared by or under the
control of the SBA or a CDC demonstrates that the value of the collateral for the 503/504 loan is sufficient to support
the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulated financial institutions have increased their portfolios of ``other real estate owned'' (OREO) as a result
of increased regulation pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The regulations for the lending institutions
require that they have the OREO property recorded on their books at a fair market value based on an appraisal prepared
in conformance with state or Federal appraisal standards. The lender regulations encourage lenders and appraisers
to value the property at a value which should lead to a relatively quick sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This has resulted in very favorable real estate sales to those with the ability to meet regulated loan-to-value ratios
and other currently stringent credit requirements of the lenders. However, loan-to-value ratios can not be met by
lenders in possession of OREO property who wish to sell it to purchasers availing themselves of the 503/504 program
when the lender takes a second lien as required under the current SBA regulation. This proposed rule is necessary to
grant small businesses equal access to opportunities to acquire real estate at favorable rates and terms from such
lending institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing rule was adopted to insure that the combination of a seller's price and terms of financing reflected a
fair market transaction. Changes in lender regulations resulting from the FIRREA and the FDICIA and the independent
fair market appraisals will protect small business borrowers and the government against the risk of over-valuation
of the OREO property. Additionally, SBA field offices will be provided guidance to insure on a case by case basis that
there is no other potential conflict of interest.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 727 series airplanes,
which would have superseded an existing AD that currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain
system and provides for the installation of a new drain valve as terminating action. The proposed action would have
deleted the existing provision for terminating action, required repetitive leak checks of both the forward and aft
lavatory drain systems, and added an optional procedure for complying with the rule. That proposal was prompted by
reports of engine and airframe damage, engine separation, and damage to property on the ground, caused by ``blue ice''
that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had dislodged from the airplane. This
action revises the proposal by changing the optional procedure, adding a requirement for installation of a cap on
the flush/fill line, and requiring periodic leak checks of the flush/fill system.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to Boeing Model 727 series airplanes, was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15305). That supplemental NPRM proposed to revise a previously issued NPRM that proposed the
supersedure of AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;5250 (51 FR 7767, March 6, 1986). AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07
currently requires periodic leak checks of the forward lavatory drain system and provides for the installation of
a new drain valve as terminating action. The previously issued supplemental NPRM proposed to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Delete the existing provision for terminating action; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Require repetitive leak checks of both the forward and the aft lavatory drain systems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Provide an optional procedure for complying with the rule, which would entail revising the FAA-approved maintenance
program to incorporate a schedule and procedure to conduct leak checks of the lavatory drain systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action was prompted by reports of engine and airframe damage, and one report of engine separation on a
Boeing Model 727 series airplane that occurred subsequent to the issuance of AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07. These incidents
were caused by ``blue ice'' that had formed from leaking forward lavatory drain systems and subsequently had broken
loose from the airplane and struck the fuselage or had been ingested into the engine. The proposed action also was prompted
by reports of leakage from lavatory drain valves that have a configuration similar to that specified in AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07
as terminating action. Such leakage can result in the formation of blue ice, which can dislodge from the airplane and
result in engine damage or separation, airframe damage, and/or a hazard to persons or property on the ground.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that supplemental NPRM, the FAA has determined that certain additional changes to the proposed
rule are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Changes to the Proposal: ``The Comprehensive Approach'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed its position on the option that was provided in the previous supplemental NPRM, which would have
permitted operators to revise the FAA-approved maintenance program to include procedures to address the problems
associated with blue ice. The FAA now considers that an even more comprehensive approach should be taken to address
the subject unsafe condition via the FAA-approved maintenance program. This approach should be based upon regular
maintenance, training of personnel, use of hardware with proven reliability, and fixed, but less frequent, leak
checks incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance program. Paragraph (b) of this supplemental NPRM has been
revised to specify the requirements for the maintenance program revision that the FAA has determined are necessary
in order to implement this ``comprehensive approach.'' (A more detailed discussion of these proposed requirements
is presented later in this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In lieu of the revising the maintenance program, however, this supplemental NPRM will continue to provide operators
with the option of accomplishing the specific leak check procedures on the drain systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Changes to the Notice: Extension of Leak Check Intervals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed AD would extend the previously-proposed leak check intervals for certain specific valves, provided
that a suitable program of maintenance and training of personnel is also implemented. These intervals have been extended
based upon data gathered to date regarding the service history of the valve types. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed AD would also require that any revisions to (i.e., extension of) the mandated leak check intervals must
be approved by the FAA, specifically, by the Manager of the Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO). Requests
for such revisions must be accompanied by certain data when submitted to the ACO [through the appropriate FAA Principal
Maintenance Inspector (PMI)] for approval. In this supplemental NPRM, the FAA proposes a ``data collection format''
for these requests. Data submitted in accordance with the proposed format, if favorable to an increase of leak check
intervals, will allow the FAA to justify increasing the leak check intervals with assurance that the valves involved
have the required reliability. The data provided will also be important in assisting the FAA in making future determinations
of appropriate leak check intervals for new valves that have shown promising, but not conclusive, service data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Changes to the Notice: Flush/Fill Line Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain comments submitted to the Rules Docket in response to the previously issued supplemental NPRM included reference
to three incidents of foreign object damage from the forward toilet drain valve and flush/fill line on certain airplanes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also has received a report of a dent on the right horizontal stabilizer leading edge on a Boeing Model 737 series
airplane that was caused by blue ice that had formed from leakage through a flush/fill line. In this case, the flush/fill
cap was missing from the line at the forward service panel. The flush/fill line on the Model 737 is similar in design
to that on the Model 727; therefore, the potential exists for the same type of incident occurring on the Model 727. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in their comments to the Rules Docket, numerous operators stated that leakage from the flush/fill line is
a significant source of the type of blue ice problems addressed by this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there are not many documented cases of blue ice coming from the flush/fill line causing damage to engines, such
blue ice is still a hazard to persons and property on the ground and, therefore, constitutes an unsafe condition. In
light of this, the FAA has reconsidered its previous statement that flush/fill line leakage would be ``addressed
by a separate rulemaking action,'' and is proposing requirements in this supplemental NPRM to install a cap on the
flush/fill line and to perform periodic leak checks of the flush/fill line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992, that provides
instructions for modifying the forward, aft, and executive lavatory drain systems by installing a cap on the flush/fill
lines. This modification will prevent blue fluid leakage and subsequent ice accumulation in the executive and aft
lavatory service panels, and in the forward lavatory waste system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This supplemental NPRM proposes to require the installation of the flush/fill line cap in accordance with the Boeing
service bulletin within 5,000 flight hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Changes to the Notice: New Owners' Schedules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new paragraph (e) has been added to this supplemental NPRM to require that, before an operator places an airplane
subject to the AD into service, the operator must establish a schedule for accomplishment of the leak checks. This
provision is intended to ensure that transferred airplanes are inspected in accordance with the AD on the same basis
as if there were continuity in ownership, and that scheduling of the leak checks for each airplane is not delayed or
postponed due to a transfer of ownership. Airplanes that have previously been subject to the AD would have to be checked
in accordance with either the previous operator's or the new operator's schedule, whichever would result in the earlier
accomplishment date for that leak check. Other airplanes would have to be inspected before an operator could begin
operating them or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA PMI, but within a period not exceeding 200 flight
hours.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the changes described above expand the scope of the previously proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it
is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due consideration has been given to the following comments that were submitted in response to the previously issued
supplemental NPRM: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Hardware Nomenclature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggest that the proposal be revised to include terms that would more specifically describe the
valves that are affected by the rule. Certain commenters suggest that generic references to ``ball valves'' in proposed
paragraph (a) should be replaced with references to ``Boeing Specification S417T105,'' which more clearly defines
the configuration of the specific ball valve that must be inspected. These commenters also suggest that references
in proposed paragraph (a) to the ``Shaw Aero Devices, Inc., drain valve that incorporates an integral inner door with
a second positive seal,'' be replaced with references to the ``service panel valve per Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213.''
On the other hand, one commenter requests that the terms used in the proposal to describe the Shaw Aero valve be retained,
so that earlier models of the Shaw Aero valve (not configured per Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213) would ``benefit''
from the proposed extended leak check intervals. Another commenter states that the earlier models of those Shaw Aero
valves were upgraded because they leaked and, therefore, those valves should not be included with the valves specified
by ``Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213'' for purposes of receiving the extended leak check periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed the data submitted with these comments and finds that certain of the requested changes are appropriate.
The FAA concurs with the request to specifically identify those valves approved for the longer leak check intervals.
The FAA has reviewed the referenced Boeing specifications, as well as the part numbers of valves that have been determined
to meet these specifications and that have service history data approved by the FAA. The FAA has determined that the
qualifying valves are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Valves meeting Boeing Specification S417T105: Kaiser Electroprecision valves having part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5
(or higher ``dash number''); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Valves meeting Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213: Kaiser Electroprecision valves having part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8
(or higher ``dash number''); and Shaw Aero Devices valves having part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher ``dash
numbers''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this supplemental NPRM has been revised to refer to certain of the affected valves as those having the part
numbers indicated above. Valves having Kaiser Electroprecision part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher ``dash
number'') would be required to be leak checked at intervals of either 1,500 flight hours [per proposed paragraph (a)]
or 5,000 flight hours [per proposed paragraph (b)]. Valves having Kaiser Electroprecision part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8
(or higher ``dash number'') or Shaw Aero Devices part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher ``dash numbers'') would
be required to be leak checked at intervals of 1,000 flight hours. To ensure that any valves developed at a later date
are also reviewed first by the FAA for adequate service history, new paragraph (f) of the proposed rule makes a provision
for the service history data of such additional valves to be approved by means of an alternative method of compliance
with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Ball Valves, General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggest that, because of the history of the general reliability of ball valves, the proposed rule
should be revised to permit installation of a ball valve in a drain system as terminating action for the leak checks
of that particular drain system. Other commenters request that, based on this history of reliability, the proposed
1,500-flight hour leak checks intervals for drain systems incorporating ball valves, as proposed in paragraph (a)(1),
be extended to 4,000 or 6,000 flight hours.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur. While a ball valve may be reliable if properly maintained, it may still leak eventually due
to seal wear or the entrapment of foreign material on the sealing surfaces. Damage to the sealing surfaces in a ball
valve due to foreign materials, while uncommon, may also cause leakage at any time. If there are no maintenance actions
aimed at detecting such leakage, the leakage could continue until the next leak check. An extremely long interval
between leak checks, as suggested by the commenters, would allow leakage to go undetected for a long time and, thus,
create conditions favorable for the eventual formation of blue ice. The FAA has determined that, by limiting the leak
check interval to 1,500 flight hours, the risk of long term leakage is reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Ball Valve Leak Checks, Plus Maintenance and Training Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters request that the proposed leak check intervals for drain systems incorporating a ball valve be
extended to 4,000 or 6,000 flight hours, if those leak checks are coupled with a specific maintenance program as well
as a program to train personnel to perform certain actions. Some of these commenters consider that incorporation
of the 1,500-flight hour leak checks into the operators' FAA-approved maintenance program, as proposed in paragraph
(b) of the previous NPRM, does not provide sufficient motivation for operators to incorporate ball valves into the
fleet (even though the ball valves are more reliable than other types). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs with these commenters' request. The FAA has determined that installation of a design package that
includes a ball valve installed in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30,
1992, combined with certain maintenance actions and trained personnel (discussed in detail later) will provide
adequate assurance that long term leakage will not occur. Therefore, the FAA has revised paragraph (b) of the supplemental
NPRM to provide for leak check intervals up to 5,000 flight hours for applicable ball valve installations that are
coupled with maintenance procedures and training of personnel. This change is specifically intended to encourage
operators to use valve designs having proven reliability; the incorporation of sufficient maintenance practices
and trained personnel will ensure that the inherent reliability of the design is not degraded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Shaw Aero Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requests that the leak check intervals for drain systems with Shaw Aero valves that incorporate the
inner door with second positive seal be increased from 1,000 flight hours, as proposed in paragraph (a)(2), to 1,500
or 4,000 flight hours. This commenter considers that this request is justified based on the lack of adverse service
history on the subject valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, another commenter objects to the proposed 1,000-flight hour leak check interval for these valves,
and suggests that it should be shortened. This commenter states that there are certain considerations that are critical
in establishing leak check intervals based on component failure rates derived from evaluations of in-service history.
Such considerations are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. If the ball valve is installed internally so that service personnel cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the seals are composed of the correct material, and are not directly in the effluent path so that they cannot be
damaged by items within the effluent that can normally cause seal damage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If, because of the location of the ball valve, it is impractical to perform a seal replacement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the valve is leak checked on board the airplane without a seal change prior to the check;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This commenter states that, when these items are taken into consideration, service data gathered on this ball valve
are ``unambiguous,'' because if the valve passes a leak check, it means that the valve did not leak before the check
was conducted. However, the subject Shaw Aero valve is located in the service panel and is accessible to maintenance
personnel; moreover, it is common practice for those personnel to change the seals in the panel valve prior to leak
check intervals. Therefore, the leak check service data that have been presented relative to this Shaw Aero valve
are ``questionable,'' due to the lack of reporting and the fact that seals can be changed out during servicing and prior
to the leak checks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with either commenter's request. The FAA has reviewed the design improvements and service
history data of the Shaw Aero valves having part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher dash number) and has determined
that a leak check interval of 1,000 flight hours is justifiable, based upon the best available data to date. The FAA
does agree with the latter commenter to the extent that justification for any further extension of this leak check
interval beyond 1,000 flight hours must be based on unambiguous data.

Kaiser Expander Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters submitted service history data on the Kaiser Expander valve, part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8,
and request that the proposed rule provide for a leak check interval of 4,000 or 4,500 flight hours for this valve. As
currently written, the proposed rule would place the Kaiser Expander valve in the category of valves requiring leak
checks every 200 flight hours. These commenters state that the Kaiser Expander valve has the same positive bore sealing
inner flap as the Shaw Aero valve, and has a service history to prove it is as safe, rugged, and reliable as the Shaw Aero
valve. Some of these commenters consider this Kaiser valve to be the ``best that is currently available,'' and note
that it had been approved previously as terminating action for AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs that the leak check interval for the Kaiser Expander valve, part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or
higher dash number), may be increased from the proposed 200 flight hours. The FAA has reviewed the service history
data for the Kaiser Expander valve and finds that it is sufficient to justify a 1,000-flight hour leak check interval
proposed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2)(ii) of this supplemental NPRM.

Other Brands of Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters suggest that the proposal be revised to increase the leak test intervals to 400 flight hours for the
``other valves'' referred to in proposed paragraph (a)(3) of the previous supplemental NPRM; and to allow that interval
to be increased up to 5,000 flight hours (an average ``C'' check). These commenters consider that a 200-flight hour
interval is too frequent and would create an undue economic burden on affected operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For many of the same reasons previously discussed, the FAA does not concur. The FAA does not consider that valves without
demonstrated high reliability should be used without frequent leak checking. Frequent leak checking provides assurance
that the valves will be returned to a non-leaking condition. The FAA has recognized that some valves in the ``other''
category (such as the earlier Shaw Aero valve models) do have better service history than others regarding failure
and leakage; therefore, as described previously, the FAA has singled out these valves and has extended their leak
check interval. However, for valves that are known to be more likely to leak, specifically the ``donut'' and ``taco''
valves, a 200-flight hour leak check interval is essential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to grant other brand name valves extended leak check
intervals. However, these commenters did not furnish sufficient service history or leak check data to substantiate
their requests. The FAA cannot determine if extensions of leak check intervals are warranted without being able to
review significant service history data.

Operators With No Record of Leakage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggests that the proposed rule include a provision for an extended leak check interval for operators
that have had no record of waste water leakage, regardless of what hardware configuration is used. The commenter considers
that the proposal penalizes operators who have had an excellent service history due to proper maintenance and servicing.
While the installation of additional hardware will improve the waste system and reduce the likelihood of leaking,
it should be used as an incentive for those operators that have had a history of leaking waste systems and blue ice foreign
object damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not agree that an extended interval is warranted for the reasons suggested by the commenter. Blue ice frequently
is not traceable to the particular airplane, operator, and waste system that produced it. Incidents of leakage usually
are not reported; only the relatively serious leakage incidents become known to the FAA. Previous attempts to rely
solely upon increased maintenance while using lower reliability hardware have not proven to be successful. Therefore,
a system to prevent incidents of blue ice in the fleet must be based upon assurance. The FAA considers that such assurance
is provided by frequent leak checks to ensure that the drain systems do not leak; more reliable valves may be subject
to less frequent leak checks, while less reliable valves must be subject to more frequent leak checks. As discussed
previously, the FAA considers that maintenance and training are also important factors in determining appropriate
leak check intervals, and has provided in this supplemental NPRM an option for either increased leak test intervals,
or obtaining approval for less frequent intervals when hardware is demonstrated to be reliable.

Requests for No Leak Tests for Some Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requests that, in cases where a ball valve is installed with a service panel valve that has no inner flapper,
the proposed rule not require a leak check to be done on the service panel valve. The commenter also requests that the
proposed rule be revised to require that, when a service panel valve with an inner door having a second positive seal
is installed with a ball valve, only the inner seal be tested, and the outer cap seal be visually inspected and replaced
as necessary. The commenter notes that the proposed rule would call for a pressure differential to be applied across
both the ball valve and the service panel cap valve. However, on many ball valve installations, the service panel cap
has no inner flapper. Applying a pressure differential across this cap would require spilling a substantial quantity
of fluid on the ramp in order to service the system after completion of the leak check. The commenter recommends that
the service panel cap valve only be leak checked if it incorporates a dual seal design, and that the outer cap be visually
inspected for wear or damage, and replaced only as necessary or at predetermined intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not agree with the commenter's request to delete the leak check requirement for service panel valves that
have no inner flapper. This would be disadvantageous to operators who had a superior hardware configuration (the
dual seal), since it would require that they perform a test that is not required of installations with only a single
cap. However, the FAA does agree with the suggestion to require a leak check of only the inner flapper for service panel
valves with a dual seal design, and the performance of visual inspections/seal changes of only the outer cap. This
will ensure that one seal downstream of the ball valve is returned to a ``no-leak'' condition. This supplemental NPRM
has been revised accordingly.

Development of New Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters request that the proposed rule provide for a method to encourage the development of new, more reliable
equipment, and extend the leak check intervals for that equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees that the industry should be encouraged to develop improved hardware that will better address the unsafe
condition presented by problems associated with blue ice. As one method to achieve this goal, and to provide assurance
of a high degree of reliability of the hardware involved, the FAA has proposed in paragraph (c) of this supplemental
NPRM, a method of data collection relative to the reliability of valves. This approach is not intended to supersede
existing methods for equipment qualification and certification. However, this method of data collection is intended
to ensure the collection of unambiguous data, which will provide the FAA with adequate resources and information
to determine appropriate leak check intervals for new and existing designs. The FAA intends to use the data that are
eventually collected to determine if extensions to the currently proposed leak check intervals are justified, specifically
for those operators who choose to incorporate certain maintenance and training requirements into their FAA maintenance
programs in accordance with paragraph (b) of this supplemental NPRM. The FAA specifically requests additional suggestions
as to methods that will further ensure the validity of the data gathered.

Implementation of a New Maintenance and Training Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to provide for an alternative to the fixed leak check
intervals by permitting the implementation of a program in which operators could incorporate a schedule of maintenance
actions, training, and periodic leak checks into their FAA-approved maintenance program. These commenters state
that merely performing more leak checks at greater frequencies will not, by itself, address the blue ice problem.
Instead, other maintenance tasks, such as replacing seals at regular intervals and establishing effective communication
procedures between maintenance personnel and the flight crew, play more significant roles in addressing blue ice
safety concerns. The commenters request that compliance periods for leak checks be adjusted in accordance with existing
FAA-approved reliability programs, or be increased to ``C'' check intervals, provided that certain maintenance
and training programs were initially included in the maintenance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs that these commenters' suggestions have merit. The FAA has determined that an increase in the leak
check intervals could be justified if the equipment is demonstrated to be highly reliable, and a program of regular
maintenance and training is implemented. The FAA has revised proposed paragraph (b) of the supplemental AD to include
specific procedures considered to be essential in such a program. These procedures include: (1) Repetitive replacement
of seals, (2) leak checks at various intervals depending upon the valve configuration, (3) leak checks of flush/fill
line caps, (4) visual checks conducted by maintenance personnel at regular intervals to detect leakage, (5) procedures
for reporting discrepancies, and (6) training programs for maintenance and service personnel that include information
on ``Blue Ice Awareness'' and the hazards of blue ice. The proposal specifically would extend the leak check interval
for certain valves to 5,000 flight hours (which is equivalent to a ``C'' check for the majority of affected operators),
provided the specified program of maintenance and training is implemented.

Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters request that proposed paragraph (b) of the NPRM be revised to specify that, once operators have acceptably
revised their maintenance program to include the specified actions, the AD is no longer ``applicable'' to those operators.
In effect, the maintenance program revision should be considered ``terminating action'' for the AD. These commenters
would prefer to accomplish all of their AD-required leak check tasks within the parameters of their FAA-approved
maintenance program, since ``operators have more flexibility in adjusting leak check intervals in accordance with
their FAA-approved reliability programs and recordkeeping requirements are less cumbersome.'' The commenters
point out that paragraph (b) of the previous NPRM denies operators the opportunity to integrate their leak check tasks
into their maintenance program, since ``the NPRM fails to indicate that AD recording procedures are not in effect,
and disallows the opportunity to ever adjust the leak check intervals without seeking approval under the alternative
method of compliance provision.'' The commenters request that, for these operators, the proposed rule provide for
the use of an alternative method of recordkeeping to that otherwise required by Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)
91.417 (``Maintenance records'') and 121.380 (``Maintenance recording requirements''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to revise the proposal to indicate in any way that it is ``no longer
applicable'' once the revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program is implemented and the appropriate logbook
entry made. The FAA considers that, even though this proposed AD would affect the maintenance program, it is of such
importance that it warrants other than ``normal'' procedures to be followed in certain aspects. Specifically, under
``normal'' maintenance program procedures, the PMI is authorized to approve any revisions of the maintenance program,
including adjustments of the leak check intervals. However, for reasons detailed below, the FAA has determined that
the PMI is not the appropriate FAA official for adjusting the compliance intervals for leak checks specified by the
terms of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to revise the proposal to provide specifically for
the use of an alternative method of recordkeeping. Although the FAA has included such a provision in other rulemaking
actions [reference, for example, AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;08 R1, amendment 39&hyph;8591 (58 FR 32281, June 9, 1993);
and AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;09 R1, amendment 39&hyph;8590 (58 FR 32278, June 9,1993); both of which require the implementation
of a corrosion prevention and control program on certain transport category airplanes], the FAA has been unable to
confirm that there has been any case in which an operator has found it necessary to use such alternative recordkeeping
methods. Therefore, the FAA concludes that the recordkeeping methods currently required by FAR 91.417 and 121.380
are sufficient, and there is no need to include a specific provision in this proposed rule for alternatives.

Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) Involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters recommend that the FAA recognize the merit in delegating complete program oversight responsibility
to the cognizant PMI, once an operator has an approved program in accordance with the alternative provision of proposed
paragraph (b). These commenters point out that justification for issuing the proposed AD is based on the premise that
certain operators may not have a sufficiently comprehensive maintenance program currently in place to address the
blue ice safety concern. However, once a proper maintenance program for handling the blue ice safety concerns has
been approved by the FAA and adopted, there is no longer a safety concern to warrant oversight by the Seattle ACO. The
administration of handling this program should be subject to oversight by the PMI and, as is normal for the regular
maintenance program as a whole, the PMI should be the FAA official with the authority to approve any future adjustments
to the leak check intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the FAA agrees that the PMI may be permitted certain oversight of the proposed alternative maintenance program
provision of the rule (discussed above with regard to recordkeeping), the FAA does not agree that the PMI should be
tasked with approving adjustments to the leak check intervals. In order for the PMI to have some basis for changing
the intervals, he/she would need to know (1) when to expect the valve to start leaking, and (2) how to ensure that the
leak check interval does not allow the valve to reach that point. These two important items are related to the concept
of ``failure threshold criteria.'' The FAA has reviewed available service history data (as well as comments submitted
to this and previous NPRM's) to evaluate which valves, if any, appear to have ``failure threshold criteria,'' and
what those criteria are. While certain failure modes for valves have been identified, the failure threshold criteria
are difficult to define in many cases. For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. ``Normal'' seal wear will eventually cause a valve to leak. Such seal wear should be a relatively predictable cause
of failure for any given operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Developmental problems related to valve or installation design problems (i.e., use of incorrect seal materials)
may cause leakage after the initial installation, but after the design ``fix'' is made and installed, leakage from
this type of problem should stop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Entrapment of waste materials on valve sealing surfaces can cause leakage; but this does not appear to be related
to the valve's time-in-service, in that such entrapment is as likely to occur on the first cycle as on a later cycle.
Entrapment of waste matter on the sealing surfaces has been known to cause an increase in operating torque of the valve
handle; this would be a failure threshold criterion for ball valves [which the FAA has incorporated as part of the maintenance
requirements for the in-line drain valves, as specified in proposed paragraph (b) of this supplemental NPRM]. For
certain other types of valves, however, entrapment of foreign matter does not yield such an indicator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The valve may be damaged during service on any particular cycle, assuming it is in a position where it is accessible
during normal servicing. Such damage during servicing, or even incorrect servicing (i.e., failure to install the
plug in a donut valve), may be failure modes especially for service panel-mounted valves, which are accessible. However,
they are not failure modes for in-line drain valves because these valves are not accessible during normal servicing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As one can readily recognize, different valves may or may not be susceptible to these modes of failure, depending upon
the valve design, installation location, maturity of design (all fixes incorporated), and other factors. The data
available to the FAA simply do not indicate which failure modes are most likely to cause leakage for any particular
valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the most recent analysis and data available, however, the FAA has determined that only the in-line drain ball
valve, as installed in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992, may
have specific failure threshold criteria. A PMI could use these criteria as a basis for adjusting leak check intervals
with some degree of confidence that the valve would not be allowed to reach the point when it would be expected to start
leaking. Given the high reliability of these valves (which have a very low total number of leaks from any cause), and
the element of relative predictability of failure modes (change seals regularly to avoid seal wear problems, fix
the valve if high operating torque is evident, etc.), the FAA has determined that it is appropriate to allow these valves
to be leak checked at intervals of 5,000 flight hours (equivalent to a ``C'' check). The FAA considers it impractical,
however, to allow the PMI to extend the leak check interval only for these in-line drain ball valve installations.
In any case, a leak test at ``C'' check intervals provides assurance that operators are following correct maintenance
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current data do not convince the FAA that service panel-mounted valves have been demonstrated (unambiguously)
to be as reliable as the ball valve. The ratio of failures from ``unpredictable'' failure modes to failures from ``predictable''
failure modes is not known for these valves. In light of this, a PMI would have no data on which to base an extension of
a leak check interval for panel-mounted valves with the assurance that the valve would not fail within the adjusted
interval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, PMI's who work with smaller operators would not see sufficient data to give them the assurance that an expanded
leak check interval for any valve is justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since failure threshold criteria and definitive leak/failure rate data do not exist for the majority of the subject
valves, it is essential that the FAA, at the ACO level, have feedback as to the leak and failure rates experienced in
the field. Although the PMI's serve as the FAA's critical link with the operators (and their oversight responsibilities
will not be minimized by this AD action), it is the staff of the ACO that provides the engineering support necessary
to evaluate whether increases in repeat leak check intervals will maintain an acceptable level of safety. Additionally,
given that possible new relevant issues might be revealed during the approval process, it is imperative that the engineering
staff at the ACO have such feedback.

Relationship of Leak Checks to Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters state that, because this proposal is considered to be a model for future AD actions applicable
to other airplanes (presumably including newly-delivered aircraft that will be configured with similar in-line
drain valves), the adoption of proposed paragraph (a) will require repetitive leak checks on all newly delivered
aircraft. The commenters view this as ``tantamount to issuing a certification maintenance requirement (CMR)''
via the AD process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. CMR items are intended to be repetitive inspections or component replacements for equipment,
systems, and installations. Accomplishment of CMR items would ensure that the statistical probability of certain
failures that could occur during operation of the airplane does not exceed the limitations specified in &sect;25.1309
(``Equipment, systems, and installations'') of the FAR, which is applicable to the design and approval of transport
category airplanes. Further, CMR items are based on statistical safety analyses of airplane electrical, electronic,
hydraulic, pressurization, and propulsion systems. These analyses must be completed by the manufacturer and approved
by the FAA prior to the issuance of an airplane Type Certificate (TC). Following issuance of the TC, those inspections,
component replacements, or overhaul interval requirements for airplane systems that are based on in-service experience
with the airplane, but that do not result in re-evaluation of the basic statistical analysis on which approval of the
system is based, do not qualify as CMR items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leak check schedule proposed in this notice is not related to compliance of the airplane design with the statistical
evaluation requirements of FAR &sect;25.1309 for equipment, systems, and installations. For this reason, the proposed
leak checks do not qualify as a CMR item. The intent of the proposed leak checks is to address the unsafe condition presented
by the problems associated with blue ice; the appropriate vehicle for mandating actions to address an unsafe condition
is the airworthiness directive.

Several commenters request that the proposed 30-day compliance time for revising the operators' FAA-approved maintenance
programs be extended to 180 days. The commenters consider that the proposed time is too short, since implementing
such a revision will require addition work hours, personnel, and material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs. In view of the increased scope of the proposed changes to the maintenance program, the FAA has revised
paragraph (b) to require compliance within 180 days. This will allow operators adequate time to implement the required
revisions to the maintenance program, both logistically and administratively. It will also provide time for the
development of the necessary training programs and the training of personnel in the new procedures.

Cost Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1,752 Boeing Model 727 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet, operated
by 153 operators. It is estimated that 1,277 airplanes of U.S. registry and 54 U.S. operators would be affected by this
AD. The FAA estimates that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane lavatory drain (2 drains per airplane)
to accomplish a leak check, and the average labor cost would be $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1,077 airplanes that have donut/cap type or other approved drain valves (excluding Shaw Aero drain valves)
installed in both drain systems, approximately 15 leak checks per airplane would be required each year. For the 36
airplanes that have Shaw Aero drain valves installed in both drain systems, approximately 3 leak checks per airplane
would be required each year. For the 164 airplanes that have a ball valve installed in the forward lavatory drain and
a Shaw Aero drain valve installed in the aft lavatory drain, approximately 2 leak checks of the forward drain and 3 leak
checks of the aft drain would be required per year. Based on these figures, the total annual (recurring) cost impact
of the repetitive leak checks on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,336,120. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1,277 airplanes of U.S. registry have, on an average, 3 flush/fill lines per airplane. The FAA estimates that the
installation cost of a level lock cap assembly would require approximately 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average
labor cost of $55 per work hour. Required parts are estimated to be $275 per drain installation. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the requirement to install a cap on the flush/fill lines is estimated to be $1,474,935, or an
average of $1,155 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions proposed
in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions would be accomplished
coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks.
Therefore, the actual number of necessary ``additional'' work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally,
any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the costs discussed above, for those operators who elect to comply with proposed paragraph (b) of this
AD action, the FAA estimates that it would take approximately 40 work hours per operator to incorporate the lavatory
drain system leak check procedures into the maintenance programs, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed maintenance revision requirement of this AD action on the 54
U.S. operators is estimated to be $118,800, or $2,200 per operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``total cost impact'' figures described above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished
any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if
this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore
that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit
analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. A standard instrument approach procedure
(SIAP) has been recently developed at New St. George Airport, and controlled airspace starting 700 and 1200 feet above
the surface, a 700 and 1200 foot transition area, are needed to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) departure and
arrival operations at the airport. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued
the use of the terms ``700 foot transition area and 1200 foot transition area'' and in its place use the term ``Class
E airspace'' for 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate
Class E airspace for IFR departures and IFR operators executing the recently established SIAP.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. A SIAP based on the Pribilof (SRI) non-directional beacon (NDB) has been established.
Controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface within a 6.6-mile radius and from 1200 feet above the surface within
a 10-mile radius, 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas, are needed to contain IFR operations at the airport. Airspace
Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``transition area'' and in
its place uses the term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas. The intended effect of this
proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the NDB/DME&hyph;A SIAP at the New St.
George Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas
designated as 700/1200 foot transition areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993,
and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The
Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to relocate the Kahului
(OGG) VORTAC and realign VOR airways at Kahului, Maui, Hawaii. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Hawaiian VOR Federal Airways are published in subpart E of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The VOR Federal Airways
listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to revise Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. The FAA is preparing to develop and test
Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) instrument approach procedures at the Juneau Airport and additional
controlled airspace starting at 700 feet above the surface, a 700 foot transition area, is needed for instrument flight
rules (IFR) departure and arrival operations at the airport. In order to ensure holding patterns recently developed
for use at Dillingham (DLG) are in controlled airspace, additional controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet above
the surface, a 1200 foot transition area, is needed. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993,
discontinued the use of the terms ``700 foot transition area and 1200 foot transition area'' and in its place uses the
term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 foot and 1200 foot transition areas. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide
adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations in controlled airspace.

The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class E
airspace at Juneau, and Dillingham, AK. The Alaskan Region Flight Standards Division is preparing to conduct tests
and establish IFR approach and departure procedures using DGPS at the Juneau Airport. Controlled airspace extending

&rsquo; W; to point of beginning, in addition to the existing 1200 foot transition area, is needed for IFR operations
for the airport. Two DME holdings fixes (INDRA and POWEE) have been developed for holding at the Dillingham Airport.
Additional controlled airspace from 1200 feet above the surface within a 22-mile radius of the Dillingham collocated
very high frequency omnidirectional range and ultra high frequency distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) extending
clockwise from the 308 radial to the 059 radial, 1200 foot transition areas, is needed for IFR operations. Airspace
Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``transition area'' and in
its place uses the term ``Class E airspace'' for 700 and 1200 foot transition areas. The coordinates for this airspace
docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as 700/1200 foot transition areas are
published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that these proposed regulations only involve an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(l) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations regarding the preliminary entry of vessels arriving in ports
of the United States and the granting of permits for the lading and unlading of merchandise from those vessels. It is
intended that the Customs Regulations regarding this subject accurately reflect recent amendments to the underlying
statutory authority, enacted as part of the Customs Modernization Act.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, amendments to certain Customs and navigation laws became effective as the result of the President
signing Public Law 103&hyph;182, Title VI of which is popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act (the Act).
Sections 653 and 656 of the Act significantly amend the statutes governing the entry and the lading and unlading of
vessels in the United States. These operations are governed, respectively, by sections 434 and 448 of the Tariff Act
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1434 and 1448). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the subject amendments, the entry of vessels of the United States and vessels of foreign countries had been
governed by separate statutes (19 U.S.C. 1434 and 1435), neither of which included elements concerning preliminary
vessel entry or the boarding of vessels. The Act repealed section 1435 and amended section 1434 to provide for the entry
of American and foreign-documented vessels under the same statute. Additionally, the amended section 1434 now provides
authority for the promulgation of regulations regarding preliminary vessel entry, and while neither mandating
boarding for all vessels nor specifying that optional boarding must be accomplished at any particular stage of the
vessel entry process, the amended law does require that a sufficient number of vessels be boarded to ensure compliance
with the laws enforced by the Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1448 had previously linked the granting of preliminary vessel entry to a mandatory boarding requirement
and the physical presentation of manifest documents to the Customs boarding officer. The amended section 1448 no
longer contains provisions regarding preliminary vessel entry, vessel boarding, or manifest presentation, matters
which are now provided for in other statutes. Section 1448 now states that Customs may electronically issue permits
to lade or unlade merchandise, pursuant to an authorized data interchange system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations which implement the statutory authority for the granting of preliminary vessel entry and the issuance
of permits to lade and unlade merchandise are contained in &sect;&sect;4.8 and 4.30 of the Customs Regulations (19
CFR 4.8 and 4.30). These provisions still contain mandatory boarding and physical document presentation requirements,
and of course do not include any reference to the new electronic permit issuance option. This document proposes to
amend &sect;&sect;4.8 and 4.30 in order to properly implement the amended statutory authority.

Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any written comments [preferably in triplicate] that
are timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), &sect;1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and &sect;103.11(b),
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations governing the Customs field organization by changing the
boundaries of the Tampa District and the Miami District, which lie in the Southeast Region. The boundaries of these
two districts would be altered to reflect the established judicial districts within the state. This would be accomplished
by transferring the counties of Collier and Hendry to the Tampa Customs District from the Miami Customs District.
The proposed realignment will allow a more efficient use of Customs employees and facilitate operations for many
of the users of Customs services. Comments on the desirability of this proposed realignment are being solicited.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As part of its continuing effort to utilize its personnel, facilities and resources more efficiently, and to provide
better service to the public, importers and carriers, Customs is proposing to realign the boundaries of its Tampa
and Miami Districts. The proposed realignment would give jurisdiction over all cities and counties along the West
coast of Florida to the Tampa District. This would be accomplished by removing the counties of Collier and Hendry from
the Miami District and adding them to the Tampa District.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed realignment will permit personnel from the Tampa District to serve the areas of Collier and Hendry counties
which are currently under the jurisdiction of the Miami District. Currently, aircraft inspection clearances from
Naples, which is in Collier County, must be coordinated by personnel from the Miami District which is headquartered
approximately 120 miles away while personnel from the Tampa District are stationed at the Southwest Regional Airport
in Fort Myers, only 20 miles distant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional reason supporting the change is that the proposed District boundaries would also conform to the current
jurisdictional boundaries of the Customs Office of Enforcement. The enforcement boundaries were realigned in 1989
so that they would coincide with the jurisdictional boundaries of the U.S. Attorney's office and provide for a uniformity
of treatment for all penalty and seizure cases instituted in the state. If the proposed change is adopted, all Customs
transactions can be handled within the same District offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support for the proposal has been voiced by several elements of the regional importing community who anticipate improved
service from a local headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not anticipated that this proposal will have any impact on the staffing level in either District.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed new boundaries of the Tampa, Florida, District are as follows: The North shore of the St. Marys River and
the city of St. Marys Ga., and all the State of Florida except the counties of Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin, Okeechobee,
Palm Beach, Broward, Monroe, Dade.

If the proposed district boundaries are adopted, the lists of Customs regions, districts, and ports of entry in 19
CFR 101.3(b) will be amended accordingly.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains amendments to the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 55 of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code (Code). Section 55 imposes the alternative minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax (AMT). These proposed regulations are necessary to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance relating to the computation of AMT for taxpayers other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than corporations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 55 of the Code imposes an alternative minimum tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AMT) equal to the excess of the taxpayer's tentative minimum tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the taxable year over the taxpayer's regular tax for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year. Tentative minimum tax is equal to a percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount by which the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income (AMTI) exceeds an exemption amount, reduced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's AMT foreign tax credit. AMTI is the taxable income of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer determined with the adjustments provided in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56 and 58, and increased by the tax preference items described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 57. These proposed regulations provide that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of computing the AMTI of a taxpayer other than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation, all references to the taxpayer's adjusted gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income (AGI) in determining the amount of items of income, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion, or deduction must be treated as references to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's AGI as determined for regular tax purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.55&hyph;1(a) of the proposed regulations provides that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in general, all Internal Revenue Code provisions that apply in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the regular taxable income of a taxpayer also apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining the AMTI of the taxpayer. This general rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the language of section 55 and the legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history. The Service and Treasury in prior years have treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AMT as a tax system that is separate from and parallel to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular tax system. For example, regulations on the adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current earnings (ACE) adjustment provide that, except as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise provided, all Code provisions that apply in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regular taxable income of a taxpayer also apply in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining ACE. In addition, in the preamble to the final ACE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the Service and Treasury stated their belief that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress intended ACE (and the AMT in general) to be a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax system. In both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final ACE regulations, the Service and Treasury solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on ways in which ACE and the AMT might be simplified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without deviating from the results Congress intended. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments regarding the separate and parallel concept were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in response to these solicitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the Service issued Technical Advice Memorandum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9320003 and Private Letter Ruling 9321063, both involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the section 170(b)(1) charitable contribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction limitation to the computation of an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's AMTI. Section 170(b)(1) limits a taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charitable deduction for the taxable year based on the taxpayer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AGI for the year. Both of the rulings held that, consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the separate and parallel concept, and absent regulations to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrary, taxpayers must compute a separate AMT AGI for purposes of applying the section 170(b)(1) limitation to
the charitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction for AMT purposes. The separate and parallel concept on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the rulings rely would apply to any other AGI-based item as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the 1993 Form 6251, ``Alternative Minimum Tax_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals,'' reflects the position that the AMT is a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and parallel tax system, the forms and publications for prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years were less clear. The Service has received comment letters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asking that the position taken in the two rulings and the 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms be reconsidered. The authors of those comment letters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggest that the added complexity of the approach taken in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulings and forms far outweighs the benefits of consistency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying the separate and parallel concept. See Staff of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Joint Committee on Taxation, 99th Cong., General Explanation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 438 n.9 (Comm. Print 1987), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplates that the Treasury may prescribe regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviating from the separate and parallel system in cases where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such system leads to increased complexity and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In many cases, requiring taxpayers to recompute for AMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes those items of income and expense that are limited to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of AGI results in extreme complexity. Many taxpayers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have to perform those complex calculations only to discover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they do not have any AMT liability for the year. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, taxpayers' recordkeeping burdens are greatly increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they are required to maintain separate AMT carryforward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedules, regardless of whether AMT is paid in a given taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Because of the extreme complexity and increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping burdens imposed on a large number of noncorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayers under a completely separate and parallel AMT system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations provide that, in computing AMTI, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to AGI in determining the amount of items of income, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion, or deduction must be treated as referring to AGI for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular tax purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations are proposed to be effective for taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years beginning after December 31, 1993. See, however, Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94&hyph;28, I.R.B. 1994&hyph;14, for rules concerning the computation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMTI in accordance with these proposed regulations for taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years beginning before January 1, 1994.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to these proposed rules, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses.

Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are submitted timely (preferably a signed original and eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies) to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for Monday, June 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, at 10 a.m. in the Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. Because of access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must submit written comments by May 17, 1994 and submit an outline of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topic by Monday, May 16, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing.

SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

II. This Action
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (See 57 FR 13565&hyph;66).

 SIP because EPA believes it meets all applicable requirements of the Act that were due on November 15, 1991. (Also note
that EPA is proposing to approve the contingency measures submitted for the area). The SIP includes the original document
submitted to EPA on August 28, 1989, and eight subsequent submittals containing additional information. The dates
of these submittals are: October 24, 1989, November 21, 1989, December 20, 1989, February 16, 1990, March 29, 1990,
August 21, 1991, November 8, 1991, and March 3, 1992.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans for submission
to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after
reasonable notice and public hearing.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Section 110(1) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the application provisions
of section 110(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission.
However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months
after receipt of the submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wyoming held a public hearing on July 17, 1989, to entertain public comment on the implementation plan
for the city of Sheridan. The State provided adequate notice of public hearing; the State requires 45 days notice.
Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the State, signed by the Governor on July 17, 1989, and submitted
to EPA on August 28, 1989, as a proposed attachment to the SIP. On March 8, 1990, EPA determined that the Sheridan SIP
submittal was administratively and technically complete and proceeded to draft a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice proposing to approve the SIP. However, upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments to the Act, EPA re-assessed the
SIP for conformance with the Amendments and determined that additional information was required to comply with the
new Amendments. Of the eight submittals made subsequent to the original document, four were received to address requirements
of the new Amendments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following submittal of the additional information required by the 1990 Amendments, the SIP revision was reviewed
by EPA to determine its completeness, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix
V (1992). The final submittal was received on March 5, 1992, and a letter dated April 14, 1992, was forwarded to the Governor
indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. As noted in this action,
EPA proposes to approve the Wyoming PM

2. Accurate Emissions Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory
should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. See, for
example, section 110(a)(2)(K). Because the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment
demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received
with the attainment demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming submitted an emissions inventory in 1989 for base year 1986. This base year emissions inventory was subsequently
revised and resubmitted in March 1992. The base year inventory (both versions) identified fugitive road dust as the
primary cause of nonattainment contributing over 74.35 percent of the total emissions during the time that the violations
were recorded. Additional contributing sources included natural gas, 0.01 percent; coal burning, 1.61 percent;
wood burning, 14.80 percent; automobile emissions, 0.51 percent; Veterans Medical Center, 1.12 percent; Sheridan
Forest Products, 0.75 percent; Wyoming Sawmill, 2.38 percent; and Burlington Northern, 4.38 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive,
and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent
with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act.

10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). The EPA's interpretation of this
requirement is set out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
here only in broad terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State should first identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in light of
the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State may reject an available control measure if the measure is technologically infeasible or the cost of the control
is unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three source categories were identified as contributing to the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment problem in Sheridan. However, the SIP only relies on one control strategy to demonstrate attainment,
the Sanding Winter Maintenance Program (SWMP), which was adopted on July 17, 1989. This plan, developed by the Sheridan
Air Quality Committee, designates streets to be sanded during the winter season. Included are major streets, hills,
school zones, and dangerous intersections. The plan specifies a material application rate which has been determined
to provide adequate traction, and sanding material specifications which insures use of a clean and durable media.
A comprehensive street sweeping and flushing program will remove material before dust problems occur. The reduction
in PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from fugitive road dust, between the base year inventory (911.84 tpy), and the attainment inventory (738.11
tpy) was calculated at 19% or 173.73 tpy. Credit for this reduction is given to the SWMP only. No credit was taken for
two other control strategies outlined in the SIP, a voluntary woodburning curtailment program and dust control plans
for three industrial sources. The reduction in ``total'' PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions between the base year inventory (1238.98 tpy) and attainment inventory (1137.39 tpy) is 8% or 101.19 tpy.
(The reason for the reduction in fugitive road dust emissions being greater than the reduction for total emissions
between the base and attainment years, is that there was an increase in fugitive dust emissions over the same period
of 87.35 tpy from two industrial sites. The overall result, however, is a net decrease in emissions). The voluntary
woodburning curtailment plan and the industrial dust control plan were submitted with the SIP; EPA is taking no action
on these two programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions and their associated control measures (including
available control technology) can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that
it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. RACM does not require the implementation of all available
control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment and the implementation of additional available control
measures would not expedite attainment. 57 FR 13543. The implementation of Wyoming's PM

The Act requires demonstration of attainment by December 31, 1994. However, when this SIP was submitted, the Group
I requirements called for attainment demonstration in 1989, with maintenance through 1994. Although the State did
submit additional information in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments, the demonstration of attainment did not
change. EPA believes, however, that since the Wyoming DEQ has shown maintenance of the NAAQS through 1994, the State
has met the requirements to show attainment by December 31, 1994.

10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide
for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the
Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994 is impracticable. In the General Preamble,
EPA recommended that the attainment demonstrations for the initial moderate areas follow existing modeling guidelines

Wyoming conducted an attainment demonstration using

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 In fact, a violation of the 24-hour PM

<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 A single exceedence of 198 &mu;g/m3 was monitored on November 12, 1991. However, data results (Attachment 6 of the
Appendix to the SIP) showed that, even with the ``gray zone'' allowance, the annual PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard had been violated. (The ``gray zone'' allowance refers to a 20 percent overestimation of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations resulting from design flaws in the pre-1987 non-reference Sierra Anderson SA321A sampler; the problem
was resolved when the sampler was modified and became the SA321B.) This explained the reasoning for the State's decision
to focus on the annual standard, and for the annual PM

this approach.

The Act requires demonstration of attainment by December 31, 1994. However, when this SIP was submitted, the Group
I requirements called for attainment demonstration in 1989, with maintenance through 1994. Although the State did
submit additional information in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments, the demonstration of attainment did not
change. EPA believes, however, that since the Wyoming DEQ has shown maintenance of the NAAQS through 1994, the State
has met the requirements to show attainment by December 31, 1994.

EPA does not anticipate much change in population, based upon population data for Sheridan County submitted by DEQ
on November 8, 1991. The data were obtained from the January 1988 and July 1991 reports from the Department of Administration
and Information, Division of Economic Analysis, ``Wyoming Population and Employment Forecast Report.'' The population
forecast including the years 1986 (population = 26,449) through 1994 (population = 24,209), indicates that Sheridan
County will not reach the 1986 population until the year 2004. After having examined the impact of growth on the 24-hour

adopted to protect the annual standard are sufficient to maintain the 24-hour standard. For a more detailed description
of the attainment demonstration and the control strategies used, see the TSD accompanying this document.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An analysis of air quality and emissions data for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment area of Sheridan demonstrates that violations of the annual NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct
particulate matter emissions from re-entrained road dust and woodburning. The emission inventory and CMB data for
Sheridan did not reveal any significant sources of sulfates or nitrates in the area. Consequently, EPA is proposing
to find that major sources of precursors of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 do not contribute significantly to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequence of this finding is to exclude any such sources from the applicability
of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's
finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this notice. Note that while EPA is proposing to make a general finding
for this area, today's proposed finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing
mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors
in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor
emissions in an area.

The PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to
be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section
171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further progress is defined
in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required
by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable
NAAQS by the applicable date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering the quantitive milestones and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the
attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to ensure timely attainment
and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1) of the Act). The PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for the Sheridan nonattainment area demonstrates attainment by December 31, 1994 satisfying the initial quantitive
milestone requirement.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 EPA also proposes to find that at this time the SIP meets Reasonable Further Progress.

The emissions reduction progress made prior to the attainment date of December 31, 1994 (only 46 days beyond the November
15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first milestone requirement (57 FR 13539). The de minimis timing differential
makes it administratively impractable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations.

7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al.
(see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must contain a program that provides for enforcement of the
control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). The credited control measure contained in the
SIP is the SWMP, addressed above under the section headed ``RACM (Including RACT).'' This control measure applies
to winter time street sanding and sweeping. The mayor of Sheridan approved and adopted the street sanding plan on February
21, 1989. This signed document was submitted as part of the August 28, 1989 SIP submittal. The program designates specific
city limitations/guidelines for the following parameters: sanding routes, application rates, sanding materials
and street cleaning. The program, according to the State's Attorney General, is enforceable by the State if the local
agency fails to implement the program. The authority is derived directly from state statute (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;201,
701 and 901).

8. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. These measures must
be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist
of other available measures that are not part of the areas's control strategy. These measures must take effect without
further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Sheridan SIP's contingency measure is the use of a chemical de-icer
in lieu of sand on certain roadways. The SIP provides that the contingency measure can take effect without further
action by the State or EPA Administrator, should EPA determine that the Sheridan, Wyoming nonattainment area has
failed to make RFP or to attain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard by the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1994. After review of the contingency measure, EPA is proposing
to approve the Sheridan, Wyoming, contingency plan.

III. Implications of Today's Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to approve the plan revision originally submitted to EPA for the Sheridan nonattainment area
on August 28, 1989 along with the subsequent submittals mentioned earlier (including the contingency measure).
The State of Wyoming has demonstrated that the Sheridan moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area attained the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in 1989 and that it will continue to maintain the standard through 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas, such as a new source review permit program meeting the requirements of sections 173 and 189 of
the Act, were due after the November 15, 1991 SIP requirements addressed in this notice. The EPA will determine the
adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.

VI. Applicability to Future SIP Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to any State Implementation Plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

VII. Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA
to base its action concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 107(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, USEPA promulgated designations of whether each area
in the country was attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962), and October 5, 1978 (43 FR 45993).) Included among these designations were nonattainment
designations for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Coshocton, Gallia, Morgan, and Washington Counties in Ohio. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 provided for
both continuation of preexisting SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 designations and new criteria and procedures for redesignations. These criteria are discussed in the ``General
Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' published at 57 FR 13498 on April
16, 1992, and in a USEPA memorandum from John Seitz to the Regional Air Division Directors entitled ``Redesignation
and Maintenance Plan Requirements for Nonattainment Areas,'' dated September 4, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 6, 1992, USEPA received a submittal from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) requesting redesignation
of Coshocton, Gallia, Morgan, and Washington Counties from nonattainment to attainment for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This submittal also included air quality data summaries and daily coal sampling data for the four major power plants
in the four counties. A subsequent submittal dated July 30, 1993, provided stack test data for one of these facilities
and indicated that stack test data for the other facilities would be sent shortly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Review of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the amended Act provides that redesignations of areas from nonattainment to attainment
can be approved only if five criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) USEPA determines that the area has attained the NAAQS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) USEPA has fully approved the relevant implementation plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) USEPA determines that the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions
resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan and applicable Federal air pollutant control
regulations and other permanent and enforceable reductions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) USEPA has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of Section 175A; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) the State containing such area has met all requirements applicable to the area under Section 110 and part D. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These criteria and the extent to which these criteria are satisfied are

 have been set for three averaging times: annual (at a level of 80 micrograms per cubic meter (&mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)), 24-hour (at a level of 365 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and 3-hour (at a level of 1300 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Two types of information are used to assess whether these standards are met: ambient monitoring data, and dispersion
modeling estimates. Monitoring is generally conducted at too few locations to fully represent air quality near significant
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources. Therefore, it is common to rely more on dispersion modeling results in assessing areas' attainment status.
Indeed, in 1976, for much of Ohio including the four counties addressed in Ohio's redesignation request, USEPA promulgated
emissions limits found through modeling to be necessary to assure attainment. The nonattainment designations promulgated
in 1978 for these four counties reflected comparison of the sources' emissions with these promulgated limits. (See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices cited above.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, a redesignation of these four counties to attainment must be supported by modeling information as well
as by any available monitoring information. Provided that the source mix in the areas remains largely unchanged,
the modeling information may reflect the modeling underlying the applicable limits (whether approved State limits
or federally promulgated limits). This would involve the State demonstrating attainment by showing that emissions
levels are within limits that USEPA found would assure attainment. In the typical case involving a relatively small
number of sources with explicit limits that dominate ambient concentrations, such a demonstration would be required
to show compliance for all such sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA has examined ambient monitoring data from the Air Information Retrieval System (AIRS) data base for 1980 to
1992 in the four counties. These data indicate exceedance of an SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard on only one occasion, an exceedance in 1991 of the 3-hour average standard in Morgan County. The 3-hour and
24-hour average standards are not violated unless 2 or more exceedances occur in a year. Therefore, no SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 violations were recorded in the four county region during the 13 years examined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submittal of fuel quality data to support the State's request raises several issues. The first issue is whether
fuel quality data may be used to indicate attainment status, even though stack testing is the compliance test method
USEPA has approved for sources subject to State Implementation Plan (SIP) limits and promulgated for sources subject
to Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) limits. Since the purpose of this review is to assess air quality and not individual
source compliance, USEPA judges the use of fuel quality data to be appropriate. Indeed, fuel quality data in conjunction
with atmospheric dispersion analyses (in this case previously completed analyses) can provide information both
for a broader set of times than stack testing and for a broader set of locations than ambient monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An associated issue involves appropriate averaging times. The State's rules provide for 30-day averaging of fuel
quality data, and USEPA has adopted a policy that gives enforcement priority to sources violating applicable limits
on a 30-day average basis. Nevertheless, for purposes of reviewing whether the four counties are attaining the 24-hour
average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards, daily fuel quality information was used. Fuel quality data showing daily compliance with emissions limits
which modeling showed would assure attainment is considered evidence of attainment of both the annual average and
the 24-hour average standards. For the 3-hour standard, fuel quality data indicating continuous compliance on a
24-hour average basis is to be supplemented by stack test results demonstrating compliance on this shorter averaging
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional issue pertaining to the use of fuel quality data involves the appropriate conversion factor from fuel
sulfur content to SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. Ohio's rules provide a conversion factor for coal of 1.9 pounds of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions per pound of sulfur in fuel. However, USEPA currently believes that 1.95 pounds of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are emitted per pound of sulfur in coal. USEPA's review of the State's fuel quality information used this slightly
higher conversion factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In support of its redesignation request, the State provided available 1989 to 1991 daily coal quality data for Ohio
Valley Electric Corporation's Kyger Creek Station (in Gallia County), Ohio Power Company's Gavin Station (also
in Gallia County) and Muskingham River Station (in Morgan and Washington Counties), and Columbus and Southern Ohio
Electric Company's Conesville Station (in Coshocton County). The State also provided results of multiple stack
tests at the Muskingham River Station, and committed to send results of recently completed stack tests for the other
plants in the near future. Although three of the four counties also include at least one industrial source subject
to source-specific emissions limits, these sources are not located in the portion of the county designated nonattainment
and do not significantly affect nonattainment area air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fuel quality data submitted by the State indicate no recent violations of air quality standards in the four counties.
The Kyger Creek data showed no exceedances of the applicable limit on any day during the 3 years. The Gavin data showed
exceedances for a single boiler on three occasions in 1989, but no exceedances in 1990 or 1991. The Muskingham River
data showed numerous exceedances through May 1989, but then during the subsequent 21/2 years only one occasion of
coal for one boiler exceeding the applicable limit. On this occasion the fuel quality for other boilers was enough
below the applicable limit to compensate for the exceedance at the one boiler, such that use of the actual fuel qualities
in the modeling analysis underlying the approved SIP would indicate attainment. Finally, the Conesville data indicated
an exceedance at all boilers in April 1989, but no exceedances in the subsequent 21/2 years. These periods of compliance,
reflecting the most recent available data, provide sufficient basis for USEPA to conclude that these areas are now
attaining annual average and 24-hour average air quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fuel quality data, in conjunction with stack test data for the Muskingham River Station, also indicate attainment
of the 3-hour average standard in Morgan and Washington Counties. USEPA has not received stack test data for Coshocton
or Gallia Counties, and has not evaluated whether these counties are attaining the 3-hour standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Fully Approved Implementation Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second criterion for redesignation to attainment, given in section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii), is that the plan be fully
approved under section 110(k). The plan for the Morgan and Washington Counties nonattainment area was approved on
May 20, 1988 (53 FR 18087). Although this approval was granted under section 110(a)(2) rather than section 110(k),
section 110(a)(2) was the predecessor of and contained similar provisions as section 110(k) prior to the enactment
of section 110(k) in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Thus, USEPA views approval of a SIP under section 110(a)(2)
prior to the enactment of the 1990 amendments as sufficient to satisfy the criterion of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key elements of the plans for Coshocton and Gallia Counties are Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) limits promulgated
under section 110(c). Based on questions as to whether such plans satisfy the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii),
USEPA is deferring action on Ohio's request for these two counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Permanent and Enforceable Emission Reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third criterion for redesignation to attainment is that the improvement be attributable to permanent and enforceable
emissions reductions. For SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, this criterion could be satisfied, for example, by showing that the key sources have switched to fuels with sufficiently
lower sulfur content to meet permanent, federally enforceable fuel quality limits that provide for attainment.
For the four counties subject to the State's redesignation request, this criterion is met because the air quality
improvement is due to sources switching to coal supplies with reduced sulfur content in order to meet enforceable
limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Maintenance Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fourth criterion is that USEPA has fully approved a maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A. Section 175A requires
a plan that assures maintenance of the air quality standard for at least 10 years beyond the date of redesignation,
and includes contingency measures as necessary to assure prompt correction of any violations. USEPA has published
guidance that for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, contingency measure requirements under section 172(c)(9) (for SIPs) may be satisfied by a State having an aggressive
program for identifying and resolving any instances of sources not complying with limits established to assure attainment.
(See 57 FR 13547.) Such an enforcement program would also satisfy SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contingency measure requirements under section 175A. Ohio submitted a maintenance plan in conjunction with its
redesignation request. This action addresses Ohio's maintenance plan as well as its redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The maintenance plan submitted by Ohio includes federally mandated reductions in diesel fuel sulfur content and
the expected power plant emission reductions due to acid rain requirements under Title IV of the Clean Air Act. In addition,
Ohio maintains active tracking of the compliance status of sources and commences enforcement action upon identifying
violators, thereby assuring prompt correction of any violations of the air quality standards attributable to the
existing set of sources. Furthermore, for any new sources with the potential to cause air quality standard violations,
Federal requirements for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration include provisions to prevent new violations
of the standard. Therefore, USEPA considers the requirements of section 175A met, and is proposing to approve Ohio's
maintenance plan for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Morgan and Washington Counties. (For reasons stated previously, USEPA is not proposing action today with respect
to the requests for Coshocton and Gallia Counties, and accordingly is also not proposing action on the maintenance
plan for these counties.) If the maintenance plan for Morgan and Washington Counties is approved as proposed, Ohio
would then satisfy the fourth criterion for redesignation of these counties to attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fifth criterion is that all requirements under section 110 and part D of Title I have been met. USEPA approved the
SIP for the Morgan and Washington County nonattainment area on May 20, 1988, at 53 FR 18087. Accordingly, the fifth
criterion is satisfied for this area. USEPA is not undertaking rulemaking today on whether the federally promulgated
limits satisfy this criterion for Coshocton or Gallia Counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary of Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA has reviewed the State's submittals and other related material and has concluded that the maintenance plan
and redesignation request for Morgan and Washington Counties satisfy the applicable criteria for approval. Consequently,
USEPA proposes to approve the maintenance plan for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Morgan and Washington Counties, and to redesignate these two counties to attainment. USEPA is deferring action
with respect to Ohio's maintenance plans and redesignation requests for Coshocton and Gallia Counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small business, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignation of an area either to nonattainment or to attainment does not impose any new requirements on small entities.
Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules
on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.

Paperwork Reduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found not
to impose new or modified information collection requirements on the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 19, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) initiating a comprehensive review
of the performance of LECs under price cap regulation. Price cap regulation for the LECs became effective on January
1, 1991, and the NPRM meets a Commission pledge to review the plan during its fourth year of operation. The Commission
pledged to undertake this review when it adopted price cap regulation for the RBOCs, GTE, and electing LECs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under LEC price cap regulation, the LECs' interstate services are grouped within baskets. Rates within each basket
are capped on a formula that limits maximum rate changes. This formula produces the Price Cap Index (PCI) for the basket.
Within each basket, rate changes in any one year are also limited by rate bands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM presents data indicating that access rates have declined, service quality remains the same as before price
caps, and earnings have been higher than under rate of return regulation. The basic purpose of the review will be to
consider whether the plan should be revised to better serve the goals of the Communications Act and the public interest.
The NPRM identifies and solicits comments on three sets of issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the NPRM requests comment on a set of general issues addressing whether the goals of price caps should be refined
to assure that LEC price cap regulation facilitates the deployment of the facilities and services consumers and businesses
will need in the future. Second, the NPRM identifies a set of issues raising questions of whether to revise the current
plan to improve its performance or to adjust the plan in response to changes in technology, regulation, and the market
in the near term. The third set of issues relates to a possible transition from the baseline price cap plan toward the
relaxation of regulatory oversight and rate regulation as competition develops in the market for local exchange
access services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Common Carrier Bureau has established a computerized data base for use in the LEC price cap performance review.
This data base is located in the Industry Analysis Division's ``FCC-State Link Bulletin Board System'' (RBBS&hyph;PC),
in a directory entitled ``PRICECAP.'' (See, FCC Public Notice, DA 94&hyph;219, rel. March 8, 1994.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This 24-hour bulletin board is restricted to FCC use from 9:30 a.m.&hyph;10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.&hyph;1:30 p.m. EST,
Monday through Sunday. From 8 a.m.&hyph;9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. EST, Monday through Sunday, regulatory
commissions and other government agencies are priority users and, therefore, the system is not available to other
users during those hours. The board is available to the public (as well as government users) from 1:30 p.m.&hyph;8
a.m. EST, Monday through Sunday.

This computerized bulletin board can be accessed by using a computer and modem and calling (202) 632&hyph;1361. Users
can transfer information on the use of this board to their computers by selecting first, the ``FILE'' command from
the ``MAIN'' menu, second, the ``DOWNLOAD'' command from the ``FILE'' menu and third, the ``RBBS&hyph;PC.REF''
file in the ``BBS'' directory of the bulletin board. Users should refer to their communications package for instructions
on how to transfer the file to the users' computer system. Information on various aspects of this board can be found
by selecting first, the ``BULLETIN'' command from the ``MAIN'' menu and, second, the ``INFO'' bulletin from the list
of bulletins. In-depth information about commands, menus, and special topics can be found by selecting the ``HELP''
command, which is available in all menus. Specific questions can be sent to the System Operator by first, selecting
the ``COMMENT TO SYSOP'' command from the ``MAIN'' menu, second, typing in a message containing the question and third,
selecting the ``SAVE MESSAGE'' command. The System Operator's response to these questions can be retrieved by selecting
the ``READ MESSAGE'' command from the ``MAIN'' menu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the NPRM, the Commission is using this proceeding as a test of methods to improve the ability of the Commission
and the public to review and evaluate data and information through the use of computerized data bases. We therefore
encourage all commenters to submit, in addition to the required paper copies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NPRM at para. 107), a copy of their comments and reply comments on IBM&hyph;PC compatible diskettes to: (1) The Secretary,
Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC 20554 and (2) the Commission's copy contractor,
International Transcription Services, Inc., Room 246, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, Attn. Wilbur Thomas.
Each diskette submitted to the Office of the Secretary should be labeled CC Docket No. 94&hyph;1, Attn. Adrianne Brent,
Industry Analysis Division. All diskettes should be submitted with text files in two formats, one compatible with
WordPerfect 5.1 or 4.2 and one in ASCII, and with spreadsheets in a Lotus 1&hyph;2&hyph;3 WK1 or WK3 file, so that they
may be included in the data base. All

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the Commission identified a number of issues for comment. Each issue is categorized as a ``General,''
``Baseline,'' or ``Transition'' issue. In addition, each issue is assigned a number, and some of the issues also are
assigned a letter. For example, the first issue identified for comment in the NPRM is ``General Issue 1''; the third
issue identified for comment is ``Baseline Issue 1a''; the last issue identified for comment is ``Transition Issue
6.'' In responding to an issue identified for comment in the NPRM, commenters should specifically reference the category,
number, and where applicable, the letter that corresponds to the issue. Further, the category, number, and letter
of the issue should precede the corresponding comments. Comments filed in this format should improve the Commission
and the public's ability to review and evaluate data and information submitted in this docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM provides that comments in this docket are due on April 18, 1994, and replies are due on May 17, 1994. In order
to facilitate the creation of useful data bases in this and other Commission proceedings, we encourage comments and
suggestions for improvements to these procedures.

proposal rule amendments are promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Carriers subject to price
cap regulation for local exchange access services affected by the rule amendments under consideration generally
are large corporations or affiliates of such corporations. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed
Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief, Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
