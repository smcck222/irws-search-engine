SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the regulations regarding the number of samples that a firm would need to submit to the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service for testing at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), Ames,
Iowa. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to specify the number of samples that NVSL would need for diagnostic
test kits and for Master Seeds and Cells. The proposed amendment is necessary to provide criteria to licensees regarding
diagnostic test kits and Master Seeds and Cells because no criteria are currently included in the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 113 contain Standard Requirements for evaluating veterinary biological products that
are licensed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the
Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913, as amended by the Food Security Act of 1985. Veterinary biological products are defined
as all viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products of natural or synthetic origin, such as diagnostics, antitoxins,
vaccines, live microorganisms, killed microorganisms and antigenic or immunizing components of microorganisms
intended for the use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of diseases of animals. In order to be licensed, veterinary
biological products must be demonstrated to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purity and identity tests are performed by the licensee and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)
on the Master Seed(s) and Master Cell Stock(s) used in the production of veterinary biological products. The licensee
is also required to perform tests on the veterinary biological product following complete formulation for purity,
safety, and potency as prescribed in a filed Outline of Production or Standard Requirements for the product in accordance
with &sect;113.5. The manufacturer's test results may be checked by NVSL personnel on biological product samples
that the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to submit to NVSL in accordance with &sect;113.3.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 113.3 currently provides licensees with criteria for selection and submission of veterinary biological
products, such as vaccines, bacterins, antiserums, and toxoids to NVSL; however, it does not state the number of samples
of diagnostic test kits and Master Seeds and Cells needed by NVSL for evaluation. The proposed amendments would specify
that a minimum of 1 diagnostic test kit, 10 samples of Bacterial Master Seeds, 13 samples of Viral Master Seeds, and
36 milliliters of Master Cell Stocks would be needed for evaluation by NVSL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor editorial changes would also be made in &sect;113.309 to reflect organizational changes within APHIS.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are currently no criteria in the regulations which specify the number of samples needed by NVSL to evaluate diagnostic
test kits and Master Seeds and Cells. However, almost all of the 114 currently licensed veterinary biologics companies
submit samples of Master Seeds and Cells to NVSL for testing. In addition, at least 25 of these companies produce veterinary
diagnostic test kits and submit samples of them to NVSL for testing. Many of these companies would be considered small
entities. This proposed amendment would benefit these entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule, if adopted, would reduce the licensees' time and expense in submitting samples to the NVSL by clearly
stating the number of samples required to be submitted, by increasing the uniformity of sample submissions, and by
allowing for more efficient handling of samples by licensees and APHIS personnel. In addition, this amendment could
potentially increase revenues for manufacturers of veterinary diagnostic test kits by allowing them to return unrequested
samples to inventory for sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule.

Description of Rulechange Sought:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 To reduce immediately to 10% the random drug testing rate for aviation employees who perform critical safety and security
functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Petitioner's Reason for the Request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner feels that drug abuse among aviation employees is far less than assumed by the FAA when it established
the 50% testing rate, and therefore the present rate is neither required for safety nor cost effective.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Saab Model
SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect discrepancies of certain
main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket retaining bolts; replacement of discrepant parts; installation
of washers, if necessary; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain
nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. This proposal is prompted by reports of extension and retraction
problems on the MLG, due to loose retract actuator brackets on the MLG shock struts. The actions specified by the proposed
AD are intended to prevent a loose retract actuator bracket from interfering with the MLG shock strut trunnion support,
which could result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Luftfartsverket, which is the airworthiness authority for Sweden, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition
may exist on certain Saab Model SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The Luftfartsverket advises that several operators
have reported extension and retraction problems on the main landing gear (MLG) due to loose retract actuator brackets
on the MLG shock struts. These difficulties were caused by the shearing at the head of one of the two bracket retaining
bolts. Laboratory investigations have revealed that the fracture of the retaining bolt has been attributed to fatigue
or hydrogen embrittlement (corrosion). There have also been some cases where the retaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bolt for the bonding strap had not been installed with a proper amount of washers. This can reduce pre-tension of the
bolt and allow the bracket to move and apply excessive load on the retaining bolts, and can lead to fatigue fracture
of the retract actuator bracket retaining bolt. A loose retract actuator bracket, if not detected and corrected in
a timely manner, could interfere with the MLG shock strut trunnion support, and subsequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Saab has issued Service Bulletin 340&hyph;32&hyph;094, dated October 29, 1993, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion, cracking, or damage of certain MLG retract
actuator bracket retaining bolts and to determine if the nut is bottoming the threads of certain other bolts; replacement
of any corroded, cracked, or damaged bolt; and the installation of washers, if any nut is found bottoming the threads.
The service bulletin also describes procedures for a one-time visual and magnaflux inspection during MLG overhaul
to detect any scored, cracked, or out-of-tolerance condition of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retainer bolts;
replacement of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrepant bolt; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose
landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. The Luftfartsverket classified this service bulletin as mandatory
and issued Swedish Airworthiness Directive (SAD) No. 1&hyph;061, dated November 15, 1993, in order to assure the
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Sweden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, the Luftfartsverket has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the
findings of the Luftfartsverket, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion,
cracking, or damage of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and to determine if the nut is bottoming
the threads of certain other bolts; replacement of any discrepant bolt; and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of washers, if any nut is found bottoming the threads. The proposed AD would also require a one-time visual
and magnaflux inspection during MLG overhaul to detect any scored, cracked, or out-of-tolerance condition of certain
MLG retract actuator bracket retainer bolts; replacement of any discrepant bolt; and eventual replacement of certain
MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain NLG trunnion pin cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bolts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 217 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts will be provided at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $47,740, or $220 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is proposing to amend the short supply provisions of the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) by revising the restrictions on exports to initially allow the export of up to 25,000 barrels per
day of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower. The changes proposed by this rule are based
on the President's October 22, 1992, memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce to modify existing restrictions on the
export of certain California heavy crude oil. This notice delineates the actions the Department is taking to implement
the President's decision. It also proposes specific regulatory changes implementing those actions and solicits
public comments.

Section 777.6(d)(1) of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) restricts exports of crude petroleum, including
reconstituted crude petroleum, tar sands and crude shale oil. This rule proposes to amend &sect;777.6(d)(1) to permit
exports of certain California crude oil pursuant to a Presidential Memorandum of October 22, 1992,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in which the President determined that exports of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower
were in the national interest. Before the President authorized this export of crude oil, he made findings and determinations
under three statutes: Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212(b)); section 28(u) of
the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973 (30 U.S.C. 185(u)); and
provisions of the Export Administration Act, as amended, and to the extent consistent with law, continued in effect
through the President's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Export Administration
Act was continued on March 27, 1993, by Public Law 103&hyph;10. The President made findings that exports of California
heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower: (1) Were in accord with the provisions of the Export Administration
Act of 1979, as amended;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the above findings, the President authorized the Secretary of Commerce to modify the existing restrictions
on the export of crude oil produced in the lower 48 states to initially allow the export of an average quantity of 25,000
barrels per day (MB/D) of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The President also directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce, the Interior,
Transportation, and other interested agencies, to conduct periodic reviews of such exports in light of then-existing
market circumstances. Based upon the results of these market reviews, the President authorized the Secretary of
Energy to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce that adjustments be made in the quantity of California heavy crude
oil that may be authorized for export (i.e., adjustments to the initial average authorized level of 25 MB/D).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department of Commerce's Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to amend &sect;777.6 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to allow the licensing
of exports of up to 25 MB/D per day of California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement this program, the Department proposes to: (1) Grant licenses for these exports on a first-come-first-served
basis; (2) authorize the export of up to 25 percent (2.28 million barrels) of the annual authorized volume (9.125 million
barrels) of such California crude oil per license; (3) approve only one application per company, including its affiliates,
as long as there are other outstanding non-affiliate company applications in that month; (4) allow the licensee up
to 90 days from the issuance of the license to export the oil; (5) require the licensee to certify to the Department in
writing that the export(s) occurred during the 90-day license term; (6) carry forward any portion of the 25 MB/D quota
that the Department has not licensed, except that the Department will not carry forward unlicensed portions more
than 30 days into a new calendar year; (7) return to the available quota volume all licensed volumes not shipped during
the 90-day term of an export license, except that the Department will not carry forward unshipped portions more than
30 days into the new calendar year; and (8) allow a 10 percent shipping tolerance on the licensed, but not shipped volume
of barrels and a 25 percent shipping tolerance on the total dollar value of the license, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposes to require that a prospective exporter: (1) Submit an application on BXA Form 622&hyph;P;
(2) state the total number of barrels for export during the 90-day license term not a per day rate; (3) include supporting
documents proving that the applicant has: (i) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application, or an accepted
order for the purchase of the quantity of barrels stated in the application, (ii) a verifiable contract of sale to export
the crude oil contingent on the applicant obtaining an export license, (iii) documentation proving that the crude
oil to be exported has a gravity of 20 degrees API or lower, (iv) documentation proving that the crude oil was derived
from production within the state of California, including its state submerged lands, (v) documentation certifying
that the crude oil was not produced or derived from a U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserve, and (vi) documentation certifying
that the crude oil was not produced from the submerged lands of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf; and (4) export the
licensed volumes within 90 days of the issuance of the license and to report the export to the Department of Commerce.
In addition, the Department will allow the applicant to combine licensed quantities into one or more shipments, provided
that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has expired. As set forth in the EAR, the applicant cannot
transfer a license to another person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant can file for a license at any time during the calendar year. The Department, however, will process only
one license per applicant per month as long as there are other non-affiliated applications pending during that month.
The Department will issue validated licenses expeditiously as long as there are sufficient quantities of the authorized
heavy crude oil volumes available. If there is no available volume of heavy crude oil, the Department will return the
application without action. If the volume of heavy crude oil available for export is less than the applicant requested,
the Department will contact the applicant and determine if the applicant wants the available volume. If not, the Department
will return the application without action. If the applicant wants the available volume, the Department will request
that the applicant amend its application to reflect the lesser volume.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will apply the procedures eventually adopted in response to this proposed rulemaking with additional
notice and comment to any future increase in the export volume that the Secretary of Energy may from time to time recommend
to the Department of Commerce.

Nature of the Export Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing an approach to implementing the President's decision, the Department is taking into account the nature
of the heavy crude oil export market. The Department's 1989 ``Report to the Congress on U.S. Crude Oil Exports,'' (pp.
IV&hyph;4&hyph;IV&hyph;11) concluded that opportunities to export California heavy crude generally consist
of spot market rather than year-round export activity. The report found that opportunities to export California
heavy crude oil occur intermittently and randomly throughout the year when the price of these oils are low and the price
of Pacific Rim substitutes are high. The Department's recent experience monitoring licensed export volumes strongly
supports this position. The Department recognized the need, therefore, to develop licensing procedures permitting
firms to take advantage of brief windows of opportunity and to conduct spot market export transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1989 Commerce Report also identified numerous potential participants in such a market with a wide range of economic
strengths and capabilities. The study found that allowing limited exports of California heavy crude oil would enable
some firms (e.g., the independent producers) to expand their crude oil marketing opportunities, to maintain their
existing oil production, and to earn additional revenue to reinvest in exploring for new domestic oil reserves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also recognized that having only one applicant could reduce the effectiveness of the export program.
For example, an exporter could, in a licensing program without time limits, apply for and obtain an export license
for the entire 25 MB/D per day for a one year period. If, however, the firm did not export the oil because of some problem
with the transaction, the license would never be used. This would limit the number of potential exporters, deny commercial
opportunities to other participants, and frustrate the intent of the President's export initiative. This concern
argued for limiting the term of an export license to insure that the licensee used the license and exported the oil,
or that the volume of oil quickly became available to other interested applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was also a need to assure that licenses issued to exporters would be in commercially viable volumes since the
total volume initially authorized for export is low_9.125 million barrels annually. It would be difficult to achieve
economically viable shipments if the Department were to issue numerous licenses for small volumes (e.g., 100,000
barrels).

Departmental Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the noted market dynamics and commercial consideration, the Department considers it necessary to develop
a licensing regime that: (1) Is equitable; (2) minimizes government involvement in commercial transactions; (3)
makes licenses available to a wide number of participants; (4) reviews license applications expeditiously to allow
firms to take advantage of time-sensitive spot market trading opportunities; (5) prevents a firm from obtaining
a license and not exporting the oil; (6) allows for economically viable export cargoes; and (7) does not impose unnecessary
administrative burdens on exporters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department proposes to implement the option of first-come-first-served, the Department will consider
and may adopt any of the options in this rulemaking, or an alternative proposal that addresses the above considerations.
In fact, the Department did consider several different options; they are discussed below. The Department is soliciting
comments from interested parties on the most effective approach for the Department to implement the President's
decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=6 f=2 -->
#1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
_First-Come-First-Served
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the Department would grant licenses for the export of California heavy crude oil on a first-come-first-served
basis. This option involves the minimum government management of an export licensing regime and intervention in
the market. There are numerous variations to this option which involve the number of times per year that the Department
would review and authorize export licenses. The Department could grant the licenses annually, quarterly or monthly
on a first-come-first-served basis. There are also numerous variations on the volume of oil the Department could
authorize per license. Under one variation the Department could license the entire export volume (9.125 million
barrels) to the first firm that filed an export license application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although licensing the entire volume at one time would achieve the Department's objective of minimizing the government's
role in export transactions, it may result in limiting this export opportunity to the first firm that filed a license
application. The Department, however, wants to ensure that the potential benefits of the program are diffused among
many firms and utilized. This option, therefore, calls for limiting the quantity per license (i.e., 25 percent of
the total authorized volume) and for each license to have a 90 day limit. In addition, a company and its affiliates can
receive only one license per month as long as there are other outstanding applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considers this option to be the best means available to provide a number of opportunities (at least
four) for a number of firms to participate in heavy crude oil exports with a minimum of government interference in the
export transaction. The Department also considers that the 90 day license term would assure the utilization of the
license or the rapid return of the volume of oil to the quota so others may use it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the negative side, a single company could request and receive for four months in a row a license covering 25 percent
of the authorized volume of oil just by being the earliest applicant to file with the Department. In addition, this
option would require the Department to keep running accounts on the amount available for licensing at any one time.
The Department, however, should be able to handle this because the authorized export volumes are small and the exports
are likely to occur intermittently rather than year round.

_Prorationing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prorationing procedures, such as the one the Department uses for the Alaskan North Slope/Canada (ANS/Canada) crude
oil export regime, offer some advantages but also involve a greater measure of government involvement than does licensing
on a first-come-first-served basis.

case under licensing option

On the negative side, this option would entail active government involvement in administering an export prorationing
regime on a year round basis. In addition, a prorationing scheme could be difficult to administer and could result
in economically not viable volumes. The volume of California heavy crude oil exports (25 MB/D) allowed under the President's
October 22, 1992 decision amounts to one-half of the volume authorized for the ANS/Canada export regime (50 MB/D).
Over the past four years the demand for ANS exports to Western Canada has not forced the Department to prorate exports
among competing applications. This may not be the case in the California situation where the volume is much smaller
and more firms have expressed an interest in participating in this program. Although several licensees with small
volumes could possibly combine volumes to make one shipment, it would not help exporters that had contracts to deliver
large volumes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This option would result in a greater degree of government management than would be the case under any of the other options
described above because it would involve a two step review process of all export licensing transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this procedure, potential exporters would provide enough information to allow the Department to pre-qualify
a firm as an exporter and subsequently grant final export authorization to the firm upon the provision of satisfactory
information regarding end-users and intermediate consignees, if any. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first step would involve the Department pre-qualifying exporters based upon the following criteria: (1) The
firm is a commercial entity that is interested in exporting California heavy crude oil; (2) the applicant can demonstrate
that an end-user is interested in purchasing oil from them as evidenced by a letter/telex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nominations process_step 2_would operate as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On a monthly basis, a pre-qualified exporter would nominate the quantity it would like to export during the month.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A pre-qualified exporter would have to submit his nomination no later than 10 calendar days before the first day
of the month.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. At the outset of each month, the Department would notify pre-qualified exporters of how much oil was available for
export pursuant to the quota for the month. (It could provide notice by having firms telephone a special number and/or
talk with a licensing officer.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. When nominating export volumes, the licensee would be required to provide the Department with documentation establishing:
(a) Title to the oil or a contract to purchase the oil subject to approval of the export transaction; (b) a contract or
contingent contract to export the oil subject to approval of the export transaction. The Department would also have
to approve the intermediate and ultimate foreign consignees for the oil, and; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The licensee would have 30 days to complete the export. If the export did not occur during the 30 day license term,
the Department would return the volume to the quota. If the licensee shipped part of the volume, the Department would
return unshipped volumes to the quota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other key provisions include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Department would allow the export of up to a total of 2,281,000 barrels during any 30 day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Department would limit individual company exports to 1,000,000 barrels of oil during any 30 day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Department would process only one nomination per firm per 30 day period as long as there are outstanding nominations
from non-affiliated firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department would implement the following provision in the event the volume of crude oil nominated for export exceeds
the amount allowed during a 30 day period: 1. It would allocate to each applicant an equal share of the authorized volume.
For example, if five licensees nominated a total over the authorized volume of exports, the Department would allocate
each party 20 percent of the volume available for export (i.e., 456,000 barrels out the total of 2,281,000 barrels
available), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Licensees would be allowed to combine volumes to achieve economic-sized cargoes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the positive side, this option would be responsive to the spot-market nature of the market. The pre-qualifying
process may ensure that many firms had the opportunity to participate in the export program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the negative side, the Department considers the two-step review process unnecessarily bureaucratic. This approach
would require the Department to actively manage licenses and keep running accounts on the amounts available for licensing
at any one time. In addition, exporters would have to contact the Department on an ongoing basis to determine what volume
was available for export during a given month. Exporters would have to constantly report on whether they conducted
exports and whether they exceeded their authorized export level. The Department would also have to establish a procedure
to screen and pre-qualify new entrants on a continuous basis to ensure that they would receive an opportunity to participate
in the export program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department invites written comments from interested parties that may assist it in implementing the President's
decision. Specifically, we solicit information concerning the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What are the pros and cons of each of the licensing options presented, and which, if any, do you prefer? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are there other licensing approaches that would better allow U.S. exporters to take advantage of this opportunity?
If you have a specific licensing scheme in mind, please explain it, discuss the pros and cons of the selected option,
and explain how the Department should implement your approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the Department review export license applications monthly, or more or less frequently (e.g., quarterly,
semiannually, annually, continuously)? Are exports of up to 2.28 million barrels per license sufficient to make
licenses available to more than one company while retaining the commercial viability of the exports? If not, what
is the optimal cargo size (barrels) for economically viable export shipments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should an exporter have more or less than a 90-day license to export California crude oil in a spot market trading
environment? What would be the optimal time to allow an exporter to pursue business activities while not denying opportunities
to other exporters? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Should the Department carry over export volumes not shipped in one calendar year to the next year? What is the optimal
time that the Department should carry over volumes not shipped during one calendar year? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) OEL will return to the available authorized export quota any portion of the 25 MB/D quota that OEL had licensed
but a licensee had not shipped within the 90 day authorized license term, except that OEL will not carry over unshipped

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) License holders:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 258(d)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as added by the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law
101&hyph;649, 8 U.S.C. &sect;1288 (hereinafter: the Act) directs the Secretary of State (hereinafter: the Secretary)
to compile and annually maintain a list, of longshore work by particular activity, of countries where performance
of such activity by crewmembers aboard United States vessels is prohibited by law, regulation or in practice by the
country. The Attorney General will use the list to determine whether to permit an alien crewmember to perform an activity
constituting longshore work in the United States or its coastal waters, in accordance with the conditions set in the
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department issued a list in Final Rule (56 FR 66970) on December 17, 1991, with correction at 57 FR 1384 on January
14, 1992. On December 13, 1993, an updated list was issued at 58 FR 65118. The Department formulated the lists on the
basis of reports from United States diplomatic posts aboard about relevant laws, regulations and practices of their
host countries and submissions from interested parties in response to the notice-and-comment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To update the list, the Department proposes to ask U.S. diplomatic and consular posts abroad to contact host government
officials and other appropriate sources for information on (a) any host government laws or regulations restricting
or having the effect of restricting any type of longshore activities by crews of U.S. vessels, including general immigration
laws and regulations, (b) host country practices restricting the crews of U.S. vessels from performing any type of
longshore activity normally performed in the country in the past year, and (c) changes in host country laws, regulations
or practices which have reduced or increased restrictions on longshore activities by crews of U.S. vessels. Through
this notice, the Department is seeking comments from interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking into account the language of section 258 and its legislative history, the Department adopted in prior rulemakings
an interpretation that confined its reach to situations in which crewmenbers of U.S. vessels were precluded from
performing longshore work in a foreign port by virtue of specific laws, regulations or governmental imposition or
approval of collective bargaining agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the proposed rulemaking, the Department is considering whether the above interpretation of section 258
should be maintained. Interested parties are therefore invited to submit comments on this question, including its
policy implications, as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of public comments submitted in response to this Notice and reports from the U.S. diplomatic posts abroad will
be available for public inspection in Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C St., NW., Washington, DC. For access,
interested persons should call Olga Luck at (202) 647&hyph;8484.

The Coast Guard is withdrawing a proposed rule to amend existing anchorage ground regulations for Boston Harbor.
This withdrawal is a result of a comprehensive review of the use of the local anchorages in Boston Harbor, recent rules
issued, written opinions received, and oral comments expressed at a public meeting held on December 15, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice withdraws the notice of proposed rulemaking to amend existing anchorage ground regulations in 33 CFR
110.134 for Boston Harbor, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 April 3, 1992 (57 FR 11455, CGD1&hyph;90&hyph;202). The original goals of the proposed rule were: (1) To assure maximum
availability of the limited deepwater anchorage area within Boston Harbor for use by deepdraft vessels; (2) to enhance
safety and to reduce environmental risks associated with the carriage and transfer of oil products aboard the ships
and barges that anchor in Boston Harbor. Several developments since the publication of the proposed rule have occurred
which make it unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recent dredging in the Weymouth Fore River has alleviated some of the congestion at the President Roads Anchorage.
The barges which have filled Anchorage No. 1 for the dredging portion of Boston's Third Harbor Tunnel construction,
will be out of Anchorage No. 1 by the summer of 1994 and will free up space for other barge traffic currently utilizing
the President Roads Anchorage. In addition, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to expand the President Roads Anchorage
which will provide greater access for vessels. The Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Boston Pilots, Massport,
and local shipping agents and companies, held a meeting on December 15, 1993. They agreed that better communication
between entities using the President Roads Anchorage should solve any potential overcrowding problem at the anchorage.
The Boston Pilots Association has agreed to act as an information clearinghouse for users of the President Roads Anchorage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent regulations mandated by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990
(OPA 90) have forced operators to improve response capabilities and minimize the impact of oil spills. Vessel response
plan (58 FR 7376), lightering (58 FR 48434), and on-board equipment requirements (58 FR 67996) have been published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 since the publication of this proposed rule. They have helped to reduce environmental risks associated with the carriage
and transfer of oil products aboard the ships and barges that anchor in Boston Harbor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the main premise for anchorage regulations is that navigation safety is improved and commerce is facilitated.
Excluding barges from this anchorage has the potential to restrict commerce (i.e., the tug and tow industry).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine written comments were received by this office. Six of the nine comments strongly opposed the proposed rule due
to their view that it unduly restricted barges from anchoring in the President Roads Anchorage. Two comments received
requested the Coast Guard become the clearinghouse for information on anchorage activities. One comment received
requested the Coast Guard provide language in the rule to allow for lightering/bunkering operations in Board Sound
due to the overcrowding at the President Roads Anchorage. Two comments received requested increased regulation
of watchstanding standards aboard vessels at anchorage. Other comments received requested minor clarification
of the rule, but were not substantive in nature. All verbal comments expressed at the meeting held on December 15, 1993,
reflect the text of this notice and the desire to withdraw the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Captain of the Port carefully considered all written and verbal comments and concluded that safety concerns expressed
in the notice of proposed rulemaking had been adequately addressed by the present and future operating conditions
at the President Roads Anchorage and other Boston Harbor anchorages. In addition, the information clearinghouse
sponsored by the Boston Pilots should minimize any overcrowding at the President Roads Anchorage.

 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Because nearly all Federal agencies now use E-mail, NARA recognizes that there also is
the need for Government-wide standards on managing E-mail records. Consequently, NARA has drafted the following
standards for all Federal government agencies on the proper means of identifying, maintaining, and disposing of
Federal records created or received on an E-mail system. These standards reflect the legal definition of records
in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3301) and supplement NARA records management guidance previously issued under
the law (44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2905; 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When finalized, these general standards will be used by Federal agencies to develop specific recordkeeping policies,
procedures, and requirements to fulfill their obligations under the statute and regulations. Agencies that already
have specific E-mail recordkeeping policies, procedures, and requirements in place should review them to ensure
that they are consistent with these general NARA standards. In addition, agencies are encouraged to submit their
directives implementing these standards to NARA for review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NARA has already issued regulations on electronic recordkeeping (36 CFR part 1234), and an instructional guide,
Managing Electronic Records. In addition, General Records Schedules 20, Electronic Records, and 23, ``Records
Common to Most Offices,'' provide disposition authority for some types of records created or received in electronic
form. These proposed new E-mail standards will expand this general guidance on managing electronic records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these standards NARA has recognized that agency E-mail systems have different characteristics and
agencies have differing recordkeeping requirements. Some agencies may find that currently it is only feasible to
maintain E-mail records on paper. Other agencies may find that currently it is possible and desirable to maintain
E-mail records electronically. While NARA recognizes the practical considerations that may preclude electronic
maintenance of E-mail records at this time, agencies are encouraged to consider the benefits for future use of electronically
maintaining those records that are likely to be permanently valuable. These benefits include the ease of searching
and manipulating electronic records, the availability of electronic records to many users simultaneously, and
efficient storage. Agencies that are not now technologically able to maintain E-mail records electronically should
consider electronic maintenance when updating or designing systems. This is particularly important for E-mail
records that are likely to be appraised as permanent by NARA, such as records of cabinet members or other high level
officials. The recent decision of the Office of Administration of the Executive Office of the President to begin maintaining
its E-mail records in an electronic recordkeeping system is an example of an agency updating a system that contains
permanently valuable records. NARA encourages other agencies to consider the value of electronic maintenance of
E-mail records, and it will assist agencies in evaluating the desirability of an electronic format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies must also determine how to manage under the Federal Records Act the transmission and receipt information
in the E-mail system. The agency should decide how to maintain the transmission and receipt information either as
part of the E-mail communication or as a separate record linked to the communication. Because printouts may not contain
necessary transmission and receipt information, the Court of Appeals in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Armstrong
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 held that to comply with the Federal Records Act, certain transmission and receipt information must be preserved
along with all E-mail messages that are Federal records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NARA will work closely with the agencies in the implementation of the final standards and will review, upon request,
agency directives concerning E-mail records. In addition, NARA records management evaluations of agencies will
include review and analysis of the management of E-mail records.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In soliciting comments from Federal agencies and the public, NARA particularly requests that agencies address the
practical effects of compliance with these standards. Specifically, NARA is interested in how agencies manage documents
with transmission and receipt information and handle the other types of documents, such as calendars, that are frequently
part of electronic communications systems. In addition, NARA would like to learn from agencies if they intend to maintain
E-mail records electronically now or in the future, and how they would monitor the E-mail system for compliance with
recordkeeping obligations. Agencies are also encouraged to comment on any other aspect of this guidance, or to request
further information or clarification. NARA encourages those submitting comments to include examples of solutions
to electronic recordkeeping problems that may be of assistance to other agencies in developing recordkeeping requirements
and programs for these systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These standards cover documentary materials created or received by electronic mail (E-mail) systems in Federal
agencies. Because of the widespread use of E-mail for conducting agency business, many E-mail documents meet the
definition of a ``record'' under the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chapters 29, 31, and 33). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``record'' in the Federal Records Act encompasses documentary materials in all media. The Act requires
the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to issue records management standards for all Federal agencies
(44 U.S.C. 2094 and 2905). NARA has issued records management regulations on electronic records (36 CFR part 1234),
guidance on electronic recordkeeping entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

 20, Electronic Records, and 23, Records Common to Most Offices. The standards being proposed here expand the existing
issuances and apply established records management and archival principles and techniques to records created or
received on E-mail systems. They provide instructions to program officials, information specialists, records
managers, and other E-mail users on the proper means of identifying, maintaining, and disposing of E-mail records.

3. Records Management Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Records Act, agencies' records management responsibilities include creating and maintaining
adequate and proper Federal records, regardless of the medium in which the records are created or received, and scheduling
the disposition of records no longer needed for conduct of Government business (44 U.S.C. Chapters 31 and 33). Agencies
are legally obligated to ensure creation and maintenance, for an appropriate period, of ``records containing adequate
and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions
of the agency *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (44 U.S.C. 3101). Because E-mail is often used to conduct Government business,
it is critical that agencies take steps to ensure that records created or received on E-mail systems are managed according
to the law. Accordingly, agencies must develop and implement an agency-wide program for the management of all Federal
records created or received on electronic communications systems (36 CFR 1234.10(a)). All features of E-mail systems
(including messages, calendars, directories, distribution lists, attachments such as word processing documents,
messages sent or received over external communications systems) must be evaluated to identify documentary materials
that satisfy the definition of Federal records. An agency's records management program should address all Federal
records in the E-mail system. The agency should also incorporate procedures that ensure recordkeeping and disposition
requirements are met before approving a new E-mail system or enhancements to an existing system (36 CFR 1234.10(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
4. What Are Federal Records?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``records'' in the Federal Records Act specifies the criteria under which documentary materials
are to be considered Federal records. The phrase ``regardless of physical form or characteristics'' means that the
records may be paper, film, disk, or any other physical type or form; and that the method used to record information
may be manual, mechanical, photographic, electronic, or any combination of these or other technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whatever the medium, the statute establishes two conditions that must be met for a document to be a record: (1) The document
is made or received by agency personnel under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business,
and (2) it is preserved or appropriate for preservation. Documentary materials, in any physical form, are Federal
records when they meet both tests. The word ``preserved'' means the deliberate act of filing, storing, or otherwise
systematically maintaining material as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of the data in it. ``Appropriate
for preservation'' means documentary materials made or received by an agency which in its judgment should be filed,
stored, or otherwise systematically maintained by the agency because of the evidence of agency activities or information
they contain, even though the materials may not be covered by its current filing or maintenance procedures (36 CFR
1222.12). Agencies must apply carefully reasoned judgment in deciding when E-mail documents are ``appropriate
for preservation'' and in exercising this judgment, must consider their obligation to create and maintain records
that adequately document their policies, programs, and activities under 44 U.S.C. 3101 (see previous section entitled
Records Management Responsibilities).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Record Status of E-Mail Messages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is critical that all E-mail users understand the concept of Federal records and that agencies provide sufficient
information for users to distinguish Federal records from nonrecord materials. E-mail messages are Federal records
when they meet the criteria specified in the statutory definition, i.e., they are made or received under Federal law
or in the conduct of agency business, and they are preserved or are appropriate for preservation as evidence of the
agency's organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities, or contain
information of value. Since E-mail systems transmit a variety of messages, not all E-mail documents will meet the
statutory definition of records.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some categories of E-mail messages or documents that would satisfy the definition of record are those:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Containing information developed in preparing position papers, reports, and studies;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Reflecting official actions taken in the course of conducting agency business;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Conveying information on agency programs, policies, decisions, and essential transactions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Conveying statements of policy or the rationale for official decisions or actions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Documenting oral exchanges, such as meetings or telephone conversations, during which policy was discussed or
formulated or other agency activities were planned, discussed, or transacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E-mail messages are not considered nonrecord materials merely because the information they contain may also be available
elsewhere on paper or in electronic files. Separate E-mail messages that contain the same information on Government
activities may differ in important respects and, thus, are not automatically nonrecord materials. In addition,
multiple copies of messages may all be records if they are used for different purposes in the conduct of official business
or filed in different files. In other words, if more than one office takes action or otherwise uses copies of a message,
copies would be records in each of those offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in the process of determining record status, NARA recommends that agencies consider designing into their
current or future E-mail systems a feature that helps users to identify records. For example, agencies may want their
systems to allow users to tag messages as record or nonrecord or to automatically default to the determination that
system-produced documents are records, requiring users to take additional steps to mark a document as nonrecord.
Another option would be to develop a system that analyzes the contents of a message according to specified rules in
order to prompt the user with a suggested categorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further information on making these distinctions between records and nonrecord materials, see Personal Papers
of Executive Branch Officials: A Management Guide, published by NARA in 1992.

6. Transmission and Receipt Data
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Besides the text of messages, E-mail systems may provide transmission and receipt data. In some systems, transmission
data is part of the message. In other systems some transmission data is in a separate message. Generally, receipt data
is separate from the messages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E-mail messages require some transmission data to be intelligible and to understand their context. It is essential
that necessary transmission data is preserved with all E-mail records. Many E-mail systems automatically capture
with an E-mail message the identity of the sender and the addressee(s) and the date the message was sent. Just as with
a paper record, this transmission data is necessary for an E-mail record to be complete and understandable. Agencies
should determine if any other E-mail transmission data is needed for purposes of adequacy of documentation. Both
the message and the related transmission data are Federal records and must be maintained in recordkeeping systems
for the same retention period. (See section entitled Maintenance of Federal Records Created by an E-mail System,
below.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E-mail systems may provide users with the ability to request acknowledgments or receipts showing that an E-mail message
reached the mailbox or inbox of each addressee. E-mail systems may also provide, upon request, information about
or acknowledgments of E-mail messages that were received or viewed by the addressee. Agency instructions to E-mail
system users should specify when to request such receipts or acknowledgments. Users should request receipt data
when it is needed for adequate and proper documentation of agency activities, especially when it is necessary to confirm
when an addressee has received or viewed a message. Agencies should maintain such receipts and acknowledgments associated
with Federal records for the same period as the electronic message to which they refer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Draft Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agency staff may use the E-mail system to circulate draft documents created on either the E-mail system or a separate
word processing or other system. Preliminary drafts must be maintained for purposes of adequate and proper documentation
if (1) they contain unique information, such as annotations or comments, that helps explain the formulation or execution
of agency policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities, and (2) they were circulated or made available to employees
other than the creator for the purpose of approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to keep staff
informed about agency business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because drafts in electronic form may be Federal records, the record status of electronically created drafts that
are transmitted as part of, or as attachments to, E-mail messages must be evaluated as changes are made. Successive
drafts containing substantive revisions may be Federal records; drafts containing only minor changes are less likely
to qualify as records. If the draft qualifies as a record, the agency should save a copy before the draft is deleted or
altered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Directories and Distribution Lists
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some electronic communication systems identify users by codes or nicknames. Some identify the recipients of a communication
only by the name of a distribution list. Directories or distribution lists linking such shorthand names or codes with
the names of users must be retained to ensure identification of the sender and addressee(s) of messages that are records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Calendars
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An E-mail system may provide calendars and task lists for users. Agencies that have such features on their E-mail system
should advise users that calendars, indexes of events, and task lists are Federal records if they meet the criteria
specified by law. Calendars, whether individual or shared, despite the level of the individual to whom they relate,
may be Federal records or they may be personal materials. The NARA publication Personal Papers of Executive Branch
Officials: a Management Guide provides guidance on the record status of calendars. That publication notes that the
Freedom of Information Act case law regarding ``agency records'' is the most pertinent guidance for deciding whether
calendars are Federal records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most calendars and related documents that are Federal records are disposable under General Records Schedule 23,
Item 5. Federal record calendars that relate to the activities of high-level officials, however, must be specifically
scheduled for disposition to allow NARA to appraise their value for future use. GRS 23 provides guidance on identifying
high-level officials. Users may delete calendars that are nonrecord materials at their discretion.

10. External Communications Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some Government agencies use electronic communications systems external to the Government, such as the Internet
or other commercial network services. These communications systems have established protocols that are not subject
to agency modification. However, the use of external communications systems which are neither owned nor controlled
by the agency does not alter in any way the agency's obligation under the Federal Records Act. Agencies must ensure
that Federal records sent or received on these systems are preserved and that reasonable steps are taken to capture
available transmission and receipt data needed by the agency. As is the case with any Federal record, those that are
communicated to or received from persons outside the agency or Government should include the identity of the outside
senders or addressees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Maintenance of Federal Records Created by an E-Mail System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies must ensure that all E-mail records are maintained in appropriate recordkeeping systems. Such recordkeeping
systems must meet the following requirements: (1) Permit easy and timely retrieval; (2) facilitate the distinction
between record and nonrecord materials (if such distinctions were not made previously); (3) retain the records in
a usable format until their authorized disposition date; and (4) permit transfer of permanent records to the National
Archives and Records Administration (see 36 CFR 1228.188, 36 CFR 1234.28(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies should consider the advantages of maintaining their records electronically. An electronic system may
be more easily searched and manipulated than records in paper files. An electronic file may also be available for simultaneous
use by multiple staff members and may provide a more efficient method to store records. In addition, future use of permanently
valuable E-mail records for agencies and for historical research could be enhanced by storing them electronically.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System backup tapes normally are not suitable for recordkeeping purposes because they are merely mirrors of storage
disks with data and documents scattered throughout as they are on the disks themselves. They are meant to provide only
a means of recreating a system and its data in case of emergency. Agencies should have a separate system that is appropriate
for recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases when records are maintained electronically, agencies should provide for regular backups to guard against
system failures or loss through inadvertent erasures (36 CFR 1234.30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Maintenance on the E-Mail System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
E-mail systems are generally designed for convenient and efficient agency communications and not as a system for
storing agency records for their entire life cycle. To maintain instantaneous communications capability without
increasing hardware capacity, these systems often limit the number of messages that can accumulate on the system
and may automatically delete messages after a short period. If an E-mail system is not designed for or adaptable to
use as a recordkeeping system, E-mail records must be copied or moved to an appropriate recordkeeping system for maintenance
and disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Maintenance in an Electronic Recordkeeping System Other Than the E-Mail System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some agencies store their E-mail records on an electronic system separate from the E-mail system. Agencies that maintain
their records in this way must move or copy all E-mail records to the electronic recordkeeping system. The recordkeeping
system must allow segregation of permanent and temporary records and have sufficient capacity to store records for
their authorized retention periods (36 CFR 1234.10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies may retain records from E-mail systems in an off-line electronic storage format (such as optical disk or
magnetic tape) that meets the requirements described above (36 CFR 1234.28(a)). Factors to be considered in selecting
a storage medium or converting from one medium to another are identified in 36 CFR 1234.28(b)). Agencies may use optical
disk systems for the storage and retrieval of permanent records while the records remain in the agency's legal custody,
but NARA currently does not accession permanent records stored on optical disks. Permanent records stored on optical
disk must be converted to a medium acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer to NARA's legal custody, as specified in
36 CFR 1228.188. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Maintenance in Paper Recordkeeping Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies that do not have the technological capability to maintain E-mail records in an electronic recordkeeping
system must print their E-mail records. In such instances, agencies must also print related transmission and receipt
data and maintain it together with the printed communications according to the same procedures as other paper records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other agencies may have the technological capability to maintain E-mail records electronically but, nevertheless,
determine that current agency use is best served by also printing them on to paper. While it is the agency's responsibility
to determine whether its current needs are best served by one or both formats, an electronic format may be in the best
interest of future use. Accordingly, agencies must schedule and NARA must appraise both formats before E-mail records
are deleted from the electronic recordkeeping system. This ensures the opportunity for NARA to determine the best
format for the preservation of records of potential historical or other research value. (See the section below for
instructions on the disposition of records.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any agencies that maintain E-mail records only on paper even though they have the technology to maintain them electronically
are strongly encouraged to consider the benefits of an electronic format. NARA will assist such agencies in evaluating
the advantages of maintaining E-mail records electronically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those agencies that have no plans for implementing an electronic recordkeeping system are also encouraged to consider
this format when their current systems are redesigned or replaced.

12. Disposition of E-Mail Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
E-mail records may not be deleted or otherwise disposed of without prior disposition authority from NARA (44 U.S.C.
3303a). This applies to all versions of E-mail records, including the original record that is on the E-mail system
and all copies that have been forwarded to a recordkeeping system. NARA authorizes records disposition through two
mechanisms; issuance of the General Records Schedules developed by NARA for temporary records common to most or all
Federal agencies, and approval of schedules developed by agencies for records unique to the agency. The authorization
process employed by NARA involves appraisal, which is the determination of the historical or other value of the records
including the most appropriate format for future use when the same information is captured in records on different
physical formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electronic records must be scheduled even if the same information is available in another medium, including paper
printouts of electronically stored records. Information in electronic records may have greater research utility
than similar information stored on another medium because it is easier to access and manipulate. Also, it may be more
efficient to capture transmission and receipt data in electronic systems. Thus, the disposition of electronic records
may differ from the disposition of paper records with the same information. The disposition of all records, regardless
of medium (paper, magnetic, microform, etc.) must be in accordance with an approved schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Records on the E-Mail System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If an agency has an E-mail system that is designed for or is adaptable for use as an agency recordkeeping system as well
as a communications system, users must be instructed on the required steps to be taken to ensure that the record on the
user's screen or in his or her mailbox is forwarded to the recordkeeping feature of the system. If, on the other hand,
an agency has an E-mail system that cannot also serve as a recordkeeping system, users should be instructed to forward
all records from the E-mail system to an appropriate recordkeeping system to ensure that the records are preserved
and the E-mail system continues to operate efficiently. When the necessary steps have been taken to preserve the record
by using the recordkeeping feature or by forwarding it to an appropriate recordkeeping system, the identical version
that remains on the user's screen or in the user's mailbox has no continuing value to the agency or for future research.
Therefore, NARA considers the version of the record on the ``live'' E-mail system appropriate for deletion after
it has been preserved on a recordkeeping system along with all appropriate transmission data. NARA will revise General
Records Schedule 23 to authorize deletion of the copy of the record on the ``live'' E-mail system after the necessary
preservation steps have been taken. This general authorization will apply only to the E-mail record on the ``live''
E-mail system. There is no formal authorization at this time for agencies to delete E-mail records from the E-mail
system if they are stored only on the system itself or if they have been transferred to an electronic recordkeeping
system. The revised General Records Schedule will extend the authorization to these categories of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Records in Recordkeeping Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Because E-mail records must be maintained for varying retention periods and, when appraised as permanent, transferred
to NARA, it is not appropriate for NARA to issue a General Records Schedule that pertains to all E-mail records in recordkeeping
systems. Consequently, those E-mail records that have been incorporated into a recordkeeping system that includes
records from other sources or systems must be managed in accordance with the records schedule of the recordkeeping
system in which they are filed. Alternatively, those E-mail records that are maintained as a separate system must
be separately scheduled. Agencies must develop and submit to NARA schedules that identify the categories of E-mail
records in their systems if they are maintained separately so that NARA can appraise the records and provide appropriate
disposition authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously, it is established NARA policy that agencies that maintain records in paper and electronic
formats must receive the approval of NARA before disposing of either format. This will ensure that future use considerations
enter into determinations of the most appropriate format for the preservation of permanent records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
13. Security of E-Mail Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies must take adequate measures to protect records in E-mail systems (36 CFR 1234.26). Security measures must
protect E-mail records from unauthorized alterations or deletions. Agencies should regularly back up messages
stored on-line to off-line media to guard against system failures or inadvertent erasures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Training Employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies must ensure that all employees are familiar with the legal requirements for creation, maintenance, and
disposition of records on E-mail systems. The agency's directives must provide sufficient guidance so that agency
personnel are familiar with the agency's specific recordkeeping requirements and can distinguish between records
and nonrecord materials on E-mail systems (36 CFR 1222.30). Because Federal records may be created using an E-mail
system, each agency using an E-mail system should provide records management training and guidance for all employees
which includes criteria for determining which E-mail messages are records. As indicated above, it may be useful for
agencies to have designed into their E-mail systems a feature that helps users to identify Federal records.

15. Monitoring Implementation of Recordkeeping Guidance for the E-Mail System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies are responsible for monitoring the implementation of records management guidance to ensure that E-mail
users are accurately identifying records and properly maintaining them. Each agency must ensure that the implementation
of directives concerning records on its E-mail system is carried out by reviewing the systems periodically for conformance
to established agency procedures. These reviews should consist of auditing or reviewing representative samples
of all electronic communications, conducting periodic staff interviews, and internal records management evaluations.
The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that E-mail users properly determine record status and that record messages
are being properly maintained. These reviews would determine whether permanent and temporary records are segregable
and schedules are being implemented properly. Such reviews should be used to correct errors when they are found, and
to evaluate, clarify, and update agency recordkeeping directives, disposition schedules, and training for agency
staff (36 CFR 1234.10(l)). Reports concerning the results of the reviews should be made available to NARA upon request
and when it conducts evaluations of the agency's records management program.

16. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
E-mail systems provide unprecedented communications convenience. However, agencies must take the necessary measures
to ensure that there is no diminution of their records resulting from the use of E-mail systems. E-mail systems have
become important tools for the transmission of substantive information, and, therefore, they are used to create
Federal records. Agencies must take special care that employees understand their responsibilities when using E-mail
to ensure the adequate creation and proper maintenance and disposition of Federal records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified in 44 U.S.C. 3102, NARA and the agencies shall cooperate in the implementation of NARA standards. Agencies
should amend their recordkeeping policies and procedures where necessary to meet these standards. NARA will assist
agencies in implementing these standards by reviewing agency directives concerning E-mail and by participating
in agency considerations of maintaining permanent E-mail records electronically. NARA and the agencies will work
together to ensure that recordkeeping policies and programs for E-mail records serve the needs of the agencies and
the needs of future researchers.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing to disapprove a February 7, 1992, request
by Service Plastics, Inc., to incorporate certain operating restrictions for its Elk Grove Village, Illinois, facility
into the Chicago Federal Implementation Plan for ozone (Chicago FIP). If approved by USEPA, this restriction (which
attempts to limit emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) to less than 100 tons per year) would exempt Service
Plastics, Inc. from the otherwise applicable emission limits in the Chicago FIP, as promulgated by USEPA on June 29,
1990.

Under 40 CFR 52.741 (u) and (x) in the Chicago FIP, sources located in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties
with total Maximum Theoretical Emissions
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (MTE) of more than 100 tons per calendar year of VOC
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and which are not covered by a Control Techniques Guideline document, must comply with certain requirements. The
rule provides an exemption, however, for sources which are limited to 100 tons or less of VOC emissions per calendar
year, before the application of capture systems and control devices, through production or capacity limitations
contained in a federally enforceable construction permit or a State Implementation Plan (SIP) or FIP revision.

Maximum theoretical emissions (MTE) is defined in 40 CFR 52.741(a)(3) as the quantity of volatile organic material
emissions that theoretically could be emitted by a stationary source before add-on controls based on the design capacity
or maximum production capacity of the source and 8760 hours per year. The design capacity or maximum production capacity
includes use of coating(s) or ink(s) with the highest volatile organic material content actually used in practice
by the source.

On February 7, 1992, Service Plastics, Inc. requested a FIP revision that would impose the identical limitations
on its plant operations as those specified in a February 13, 1992, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA)
operating permit. If granted, this FIP revision would restrict its use of lacquers, thinners, and other VOC containing
materials with the intent of keeping its VOC emissions below 100 tons per year. IEPA's operating permit contains the
following limitations on the VOC content and the amount of VOC containing materials that can be used at its ELK Grove
Village facility:

An April 1, 1992, discussion with a Service Plastics, Inc. representative revealed that the 6.2 pounds VOC per gallon
of coating limitation is merely an average, based upon the extent to which a specific lacquer is thinned with solvent.

Service Plastics, Inc.'s requested FIP revision is not approvable for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The 6.2 pounds VOC per gallon is not a meaningful limit. It is merely an average VOC content of lacquers that are used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The ``other'' category is not specifically defined and, as a result, it is not possible to verify how much ``other''
material is used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The recordkeeping requirements are inadequate for the operating restrictions that are being requested. Neither
the monthly usage of ``as applied'' coating nor the monthly use of ``other'' material is specifically required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deficiencies were discussed with a representative of Service Plastics, Inc. on April 1, 1992.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated above, USEPA is proposing to disapprove Service Plastics, Inc.'s request for a FIP revision
in the form of operating restrictions on the amount of lacquer, thinners, and other VOC-containing materials used.
Public comment is solicited on Service Plastics, Inc.'s requested revision and on USEPA proposed rulemaking action.
Additionally, if requested, USEPA will provide an opportunity for a public hearing on this proposal. All comments
received by the close of the public comment period will be considered in the development of the USEPA final rule.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action involves only one source, Service Plastics, Inc. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this RACT promulgation
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Furthermore, as explained in this notice,
the request does not meet the requirements of the Act and USEPA cannot approve the request.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to amend 40 CFR part 85, subpart P to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the importation of certain motor vehicles and motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle engines from Canada without obtaining a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity from EPA. Such vehicles will be allowed entry into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States provided a commercial importer proves they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle certified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sale in the United States. EPA is proposing this change because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it believes that many vehicles produced by manufacturers for sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Canada are identical to their United States certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counterparts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes in subpart P which affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial importers of vehicles produced for the Canadian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market, this proposal also addresses other issues relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importation of nonconforming vehicles. EPA is proposing to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Formalize a longstanding EPA policy regarding the importation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individually owned vehicles that are proven to be identical, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all material respects, to a vehicle certified for sale in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States, establish new emission standards applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported nonconforming vehicles, clarify the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language at 40 CFR part 85, subparts P and R, which concern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion or exemption of motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines from meeting Federal emission requirements, and provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several minor clarifications to the existing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that implementation of these regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take place 30 days after publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This preamble is abbreviated from a larger supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document which expands upon the issues discussed here and which

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the importation of new motor vehicles
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle engines which are not covered by a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity. Sections 203(a)(1) and 203(b)(2) provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory authority for the regulations in today's proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, section 203(a)(1) prohibits the importation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles not covered by a certificate of conformity by any person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as provided by regulation of the Administrator. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception for regulations of the Administrator in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
203(a)(1) refers to the grant of authority in section 203(b)(2), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which states that a vehicle not covered by a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity and offered for importation shall be refused admission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the United States unless the Administrator, by regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for deferring final determination regarding admission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle offered for importation upon such terms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions as may appear appropriate to insure that any imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle will be brought into conformity with applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, requirements and limitations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement section 203(b)(2), EPA has established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures regarding the importation of vehicles not covered by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate of conformity. EPA first promulgated regulations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1972 (37 FR 24314) which allowed individuals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import vehicles and perform modifications subsequent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importation. This regulatory structure was replaced on July 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1988 with a new regulatory program promulgated on September 25, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1987. This program established the independent commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer (ICI) as the entity responsible for the importation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonconforming vehicles. The primary purpose of this NPRM is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose additional provisions regarding the importation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles intended for sale in Canada but identical to U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified configurations. See section II for a discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importation of Canadian vehicles. This proposal also includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the procedures governing the importation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonconforming vehicles generally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the regulations administering the importation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of vehicles pursuant to section 203(b)(2), EPA is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to regulations which implement section 203(b)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. Section 203(b)(1) states, ``[t]he Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon such terms and conditions as he may find necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training or for reasons of national security.'' To implement this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the Act, regulations were initially promulgated on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 10, 1974 (39 FR 32609), codified at 40 CFR part 85, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart R, to provide for a program allowing manufacturers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply for and receive exemptions for vehicles that were used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purposes specified in section 203(b)(1) of the Act. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations were amended on March 3, 1980 (45 FR 13733) to extend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the availability of exemptions under section 203(b)(1) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and other non-manufacturers. On July 14, 1982 (47 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30482) these regulations were amended to reduce the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in a manufacturer's exemption application. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations were also amended on August 27, 1985 (50 FR 34797) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that a claim of confidentiality accompany information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to EPA that is covered by such a claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to the regulations, codified at 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 85.1703, implement section 203(b)(1) of the Act to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of a motor vehicle; to clarify the definition of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precertification vehicle in contrast to a vehicle subject to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing exemption; and, to revise the regulations regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining a display exemption pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 85.1707. These proposed changes are discussed in section V, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Background for Canadian Importations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The framework of EPA's current Imports regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes, with some limited exceptions, that only independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial importers (ICIs) holding a valid certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity may import nonconforming vehicles into the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. An ICI bears the responsibility not only for performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all necessary modifications and testing, but also for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the vehicle it imports complies with United States emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the vehicle's useful life. In effect, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes on the ICI the same emission requirements the Act imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 24, 1987, potential importers of Canadian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles for resale in the U.S. petitioned EPA
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 to reconsider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations as they apply to the commercial importation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle models originally designed and built for sale in Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are identical to vehicles certified by EPA for sale in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. The petitioners maintained that, although these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles may not be labeled by the OEM as meeting United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission requirements, the vehicles do not have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanically modified to comply with such requirements and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present air quality concerns similar to those presented by other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported nonconforming vehicles.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The evidence available to EPA suggests that an overwhelming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of the vehicle models manufactured for sale in Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not configurations unique to the Canadian market, but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanically identical to their corresponding United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version regarding emissions compliance, except for EPA's labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and warranty requirements. Given this situation, EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is not necessary to require individuals and commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers to obtain separate certificates of conformity from EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those vehicles that are mechanically identical to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponding United States version regarding emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 29, 1988, EPA granted the petition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration (the document granting the petition may be found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the docket at A&hyph;89&hyph;20), and agreed to commence this rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address the unique issues surrounding Canadian vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action proposes formal revisions to EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for importing vehicles from Canada. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies or changes certain other provisions contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. EPA's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposal would allow only commercial importers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated Canadian importer status approved by EPA to import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles from Canada both for which the title has previously been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred to an ultimate purchaser and for which the title has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not yet been transferred to an ultimate purchaser, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of resale. The designated Canadian importers would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to import only those vehicles which were previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proven to be identical, in all material respects, to their United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States certified counterparts. In addition to making the showing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of identical in all material respects, a designated Canadian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer must agree to: (1) Label each vehicle for fuel economy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and emissions compliance purposes; (2) fulfill emission warranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recall obligations, and notify owners of recalls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available warranty coverage; (3) maintain adequate records; (4) pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any applicable Gas Guzzler Taxes, and Corporate Average Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economy penalties (49 CFR 531, 533); (5) submit applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final admission to EPA; (6) hold vehicles for a period of five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days (or less if approved by EPA on a case-by-case basis) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for EPA inspection before transfer to an ultimate purchaser or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealer; and (7) submit to inspections conducted by EPA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Importations by Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposal also addresses the importation of vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by individual owners. Often an individual moving to the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States from Canada wishes to import his/her vehicle for personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. In many of these cases, the vehicle is identical, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for labeling, to its United States certified counterpart. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few vehicles which are not identical to their United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified counterparts, typically require only minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications to make them identical. For these reasons, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the special circumstances associated with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual moving to the United States from Canada also warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration in this rulemaking. EPA believes that similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances may also apply to some individuals importing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles from other countries. Consequently, this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addresses vehicle importations by individuals moving to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States from other countries, as well.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's current policy permits entry to certain vehicles on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-by-case basis. EPA proposes to formalize this policy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant exemptions to individual owners (individuals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses) to import their personal vehicles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, vehicles not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported for the purpose of resale), provided they have proven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that their vehicles were: (1) Originally manufactured to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical, in all material respects, to a vehicle described in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OEM's application for certification, or (2) modified to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical in all material respects to a vehicle described in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OEMs application for certification. EPA is not proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change individual vehicle owners' responsibility for payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any Gas Guzzler taxes applicable to vehicles they import. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposal also offers individual importers the option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of having an ICI import their vehicle or engine for the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of modifying it to be identical in all material respects to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or motor vehicle engine certified by the OEM for sale in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States. Vehicles imported under this option must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified by the ICI according to OEM instructions, but do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to be tested. EPA is confident that detailed instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by an OEM specifying parts to be installed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments to be performed will be sufficient to make a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or engine identical in all material respects to a certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine, because these modifications will result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle or engine having the same parts and parameters as are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the OEM's application for certification, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes the vehicles or engines produced by the OEM within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given certified engine family. Individual vehicle owners who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might otherwise have to incur the greater expense of ICI testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a vehicle they wish to import may benefit from this option, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if modification instructions can be obtained from the OEM.

C. Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, EPA is proposing to delete the requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonconforming light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1505 or 85.1509 meet current year emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Instead of meeting current year emission standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these vehicles will be allowed to meet emission standards (with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable deterioration factors applied) that were in effect at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of original vehicle production, with a few exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These vehicles must, however, meet such emission standards using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the currently applicable testing procedures, and must meet all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable current model year fuel economy requirements. EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not proposing to change ICIs' status as small volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers and they must comply with corporate average fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economy (CAFE) requirements as imposed by the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transportation (DOT). This revision would give owners of older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicles a way to import their vehicles. Many of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles are now effectively excluded from importation due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high cost of modification to meet current model year standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may be greater than the value of the vehicle involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal does not change the emission standards for new motor vehicles imported by the original equipment manufacturers.
This proposal changes only the emission standards for motor vehicles that were originally produced in earlier years
than the model year of importation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA would continue, as under current regulations, to define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the useful life of imported nonconforming vehicles as a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time or mileage of use in the United States, beginning with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date and mileage at the time of a vehicle's release to the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or purchaser. Consequently, this proposal would not affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranty and recall requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1508 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1510 or any other requirement under that subpart.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Precertification Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposal revises the precertification exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to ICIs pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(3) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importation of nonconforming prototype vehicles for use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. Presently, the ICI must obtain written approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Administrator prior to importing such nonconforming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicles, must use the vehicle to obtain a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity, and must obtain a certificate of conformity within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
180 days of importation. In this rulemaking, EPA retains these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, and proposes additional requirements regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of precertification exemptions given to an ICI at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given time and EPA's criteria for granting precertification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(3) while other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precertification exemptions are pending. In addition, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is made for extension of the 180 day time limit under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain circumstances. A precertification exemption allows an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICI to bring a vehicle or engine into the U.S. for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining a certificate of conformity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is concerned with granting, or with the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granting, precertification exemptions when the ICI has failed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the certification process and obtain certificates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity for other prototype vehicles previously entered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this exemption. EPA is also concerned about the technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of some ICIs, that the ICIs successfully modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pending precertification vehicles, and that the ICIs continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with all requirements of the Imports regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is proposing limits to precertification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing an automatic limit of no more than three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precertification exemptions to an ICI at any one time except upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a case-by-case determination that the ICI has demonstrated an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to meet the EPA technical and time requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional prototype vehicle as well as for all other vehicles it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has already imported. Absent such approval, the ICI will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granted another precertification exemption until a certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the existing prototype vehicle(s) is obtained or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle(s) unable to be brought into conformity with Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission requirements has been exported. Secondly, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of outstanding precertification exemptions, EPA also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not grant another precertification exemption if the ICI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in noncompliance with the Imports regulations for any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle already imported until the noncompliance situation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolved. When determining whether to grant approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional exemptions, EPA will consider such factors as an ICI's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously demonstrated success in obtaining certificates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity in a timely manner, accurate and efficient compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all certification procedures, extent of progress on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding precertification exemptions, and whether the ICI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will likely be in compliance with all requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Imports regulations for other vehicles it has already imported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing the following clarifications to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precertification process to eliminate confusion associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final admission of prototype vehicles. The prototype vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the first vehicle imported and tested under the certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity for the purposes of testing every third (or fifth) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle under 40 CFR 85.1505.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, an ICI must obtain a certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of conformity within 180 days of the date of entry of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prototype vehicle. If not, then either the total amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bond is forfeited or the vehicle is exported. EPA recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are limited instances when it is not possible to obtain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate of conformity within 180 days. Therefore, EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that an extension of the 180 day requirement may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granted by the Administrator. The length of the extension will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined by EPA on a case-by-case basis considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of each ICI. The ICI must request such an extension prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the expiration of the 180 days. EPA expects to grant such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests only under unique circumstances. For example, EPA would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expect to grant an extension to an ICI who has completed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications for the vehicle and certification testing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pending, but circumstances beyond the ICI's control have led to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to obtain the certificate of conformity within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required 180 days. EPA specifically will not grant an extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for situations such as (but not limited to) when an ICI allows a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant amount of time to elapse in which significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress was not made on the vehicle, or when an ICI fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit in a timely manner the application for certification (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable parts, thereof) to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICI must comply with all requirements of Subpart P once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the certification process is complete, including the submittal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final admission forms as stated in 40 CFR 85.1505, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements and labeling requirements of 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Racing Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to 40 CFR 85.1511(e), a racing vehicle may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported by any person provided the vehicle meets one or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusion criteria set forth in 40 CFR 85.1703. Presently, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA policy will allow such a vehicle to be imported only with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior written EPA determination that the vehicle meets these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion criteria. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles which may be legally operated or are capable of being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally operated on the streets and highways will not be imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as racing vehicles. EPA proposes to incorporate this practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Warranty/Insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the current Imports program was initially implemented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1988, EPA discovered that ICIs were not capable of obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the independent insurance coverage as required in 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1510(b)(2). As a result, EPA proposes to amend the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to allow an ICI to obtain prepaid independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance coverage less than that required by the regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the ICI retaining full responsibility for the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranty coverage. The prepaid insurance policy, underwritten by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an independent insurance company, shall at a minimum provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage for emission related components installed or modified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ICI and to the maximum extent possible, the emission related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components installed by the OEM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change does not alter the requirement that the ICI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an emissions warranty as required by section 207 (a) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Minor Clarifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing the following minor clarifications and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes: (1) Adding a definition of fifteen working day hold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (and five working day hold period) (40 CFR 85.1502), (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifying that the fifteen (or five) working day hold period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins the first working day after the application for final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission is received by the Manufacturers Operations Division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (3) providing for the transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of a nonconforming motor vehicle between ICIs after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditional admission (40 CFR 85.1504), (4) adding a requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that vehicles be stored within 50 miles of the test facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the fifteen working day hold period (importers wishing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use storage facilities not meeting this criterion must obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's prior written approval) (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the acceptance of alternative dates in lieu of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of original manufacture, if it is unobtainable (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1507), (6) clarifying the repair and alteration exemption (40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 85.1511), (7) clarifying the exclusion for methanol-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles produced prior to the 1990 model year (40 CFR 85.1511), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) clarifying the catalyst control programs and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for United States version vehicles driven overseas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 CFR 85.1512), (9) clarifying that the ICI must retain control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each vehicle until final admission is granted by EPA (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1513), (10) adding a requirement that to be eligible to modify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and test six-year old or older vehicles under 40 CFR 85.1509, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICI must have a currently valid certificate of conformity for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same vehicle type (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 light-duty gasoline-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle/truck, heavy-duty diesel engine, or motorcycle) (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1509), (11) clarify that unless all requirements of 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1505 or 85.1509 have been met, final admission status will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be granted (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (12) delete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a vehicle greater than 20 original production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OP) years old which is ineligible for exclusion, must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported by an ICI (40 CFR 85.1511), (13) clarify that vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returning to the United States may be imported under bond for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restoration of any missing, damaged, or disabled emission-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts (40 CFR 85.1512), (14) modify existing regulatory language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to accurately reflect recent changes in the Act regarding useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life and civil penalties (40 CFR 85.1507, 85.1508, 85.1510, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1513), (15) clarify that a conditionally admitted vehicle or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine must comply with EPA requirements at the time that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for final admission is submitted to EPA (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;85.1513), (16) clarify that the recordkeeping requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining a list of vehicle modifications includes all part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers and calibration changes (40 CFR 85.1507), and (17) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify that a vehicle that is emission tested in order to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final admission must satisfy all of the applicable testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of part 86 (40 CFR 85.1502, 85.1505, 85.1507, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1509, 85.1513, 85.1516).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Proposed Amendments To Subpart R 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Application of Section 216(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 216(2) of the Act defines the term ``motor vehicle'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``*&blank;*&blank;* any self-propelled vehicle designed for transporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons or property on a street or highway.'' Generally, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to amend section 40 CFR 85.1703 to provide additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on when a vehicle is not a ``motor vehicle'' under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
216 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide further guidance to the regulated industry, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to: (1) Amend this exclusion provision to reflect EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy that the use of a governor to limit a vehicle's speed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25 mph is unacceptable unless the speed control device cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily be removed, disabled, or circumvented; (2) amend 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1703(a)(2) by deleting the reference to safety features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by Federal law; (3) revise 40 CFR 85.1703(a)(3) to state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Federal Interstate Highway limitations will be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if a vehicle is of ``inordinate size''; (4) include a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision reflecting the Agency's policy that racing and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles which are not capable of safe and practical street or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highway use will not be considered motor vehicles under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
216 of the Act; and (5) include a new provision to specify when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motorcycle (as defined at 40 CFR 86.402&hyph;78) will be deemed to not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a motor vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that converting a non-motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a motor vehicle, and operating it on a public street or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highway may be considered to be manufacturing and introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into commerce of an uncertified motor vehicle. This is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Act and may subject the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer to civil penalties under section 205 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Precertification Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 85.1702(a) (3) and (4), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify the distinction between a ``Precertification motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or motor vehicle engine'' and a motor vehicle or motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine subject to a testing exemption (40 CFR 85.1705). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA further proposes to revise 40 CFR 85.1702(a) (3) and (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by substituting the terms ``Manufacturer-owned vehicle'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Manufacturer-owned vehicle engine'' for the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Precertification vehicle'' and ``Precertification vehicle engine'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. Finally, EPA proposes to rename 40 CFR 85.1706 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Manufacturer-owned exemption''. For purposes of this provision, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this substitution does not expand the meaning of the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms, but only distinguishes them from the exemptions provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ICIs under Subpart P in order to eliminate possible confusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
created by the current use of the terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Display Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also proposing a revision to the display exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found at 40 CFR 85.1511(b)(4) and 85.1707. Presently, EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant a temporary display exemption for uncertified motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles under certain conditions. Although the exemption will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be retained, EPA is proposing several clarifications. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifications include incorporating EPA's policy of granting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display exemption for business or public display purposes only; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and establishing a time limit for the display exemption. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the language in the display exemption in 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85.1511(b)(4) and 40 CFR 85.1707 will be reconciled so that both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions will prohibit use on public streets and highways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except for purposes incident and necessary to the display 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Administrative Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51,735 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is therefore not subject to OMB review.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Information Collection Request document has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by EPA (OMB control number 2060&hyph;0095, ICR No. 10.06) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy

20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information has an estimated reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden averaging 0.5 hours per response and an estimated annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping burden averaging 0.3 hours per respondent. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,

C. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will not be a significant impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small business entities because the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits the small businesses that import nonconforming vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the United States, allowing them additional options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing these vehicles and minimizing their costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is publishing this Notice to afford members of the public an additional 30 days to provide comments on proposed
regulations to amend the Vaccine Injury Table governing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (hereinafter
``VICP'' or ``Program''). The VICP was established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99&hyph;660
[42 U.S.C. 300aa&hyph;10 et seq.] (Act), and provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals
who have been injured by specific childhood vaccines. Petitions for compensation under this Program are filed with
the United States Court of Federal Claims, with a copy served on the Secretary, who is denominated the ``Respondent.''
The Vaccine Injury Table (Table) included in the Act establishes presumptions about causation of certain illnesses
and conditions, which are used by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to adjudicate petitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 312 of the Act, Congress mandated that the Secretary review the scientific literature and other information
on specific adverse consequences of pertussis and rubella vaccines. In accordance with the requirements of that
law, the Secretary entered into a contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to perform this review. The IOM published
on August 27, 1991 a report of its review entitled, ``Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines'' (hereinafter
``IOM Report.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 312 also required the Secretary to propose regulations to amend the Table as a result of such findings. Accordingly,
on August 14, 1992, the Assistant Secretary for Health, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 36878) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend the Table. The NPRM was issued pursuant to section 2114
of the Act, which authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to modify the Table. As required by section 2114(c)
of the Act, the Department provided for a 6-month comment period which closed on February 11, 1993. In addition, on
December 3, 1992, the Department held a public hearing for the purpose of receiving oral testimony on the proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency analyzed the comments received in preparation for publication of the final rule. During this process,
however, the Agency became aware of the imminent publication of a 10-year follow-up study to the National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study (Madge N., Diamond J., Miller D., Ross E., McManus C., Wadsworth J., Yule W. The National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study: A 10-year follow-up. A report of the medical, social, behavioural and educational outcomes
after serious, acute, neurologic illness in early childhood. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology 1993;
Supplement No. 68;35(7):1&hyph;118; Miller D.L., Madge N., Diamond J., Wadsworth J., Ross E. Pertussis immunization
and serious acute neurological illness in children. British medical Journal 1993; 307:1171&hyph;1176, hereinafter
``Miller study.''). Because the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) was reviewed initially by the IOM,
and because the Miller study looked specifically at the relationship between vaccine administration and resulting
neurological damage, the Department determined that it should not proceed with publication of the final rule until
there had been a sufficient opportunity to consider the conclusions of the new Miller study. Accordingly, the Department
asked the IOM to convene a Committee for purposes of evaluating the Miller study in light of the conclusions of its initial
report. On March 2, 1994, the Institute of Medicine issued a report entitled ``DPT Vaccine and Chronic Nervous System
Dysfunction: A New Analysis.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that the public should have an additional 30 days to comment on the conclusions of this report
prior to publication of the final rule. Only those comments addressing the conclusions of this latest IOM report will
be considered. Commenters should address whether the proposed rule should be modified in light of the conclusions
of this latest IOM report. The Department will consider carefully all comments received, and will address these comments
in the preamble to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not able to reproduce herein the entire study for review by the public. Set forth below, however,
is the Executive Summary of the report containing the IOM's conclusions. Copies of the full report can be obtained
by contacting the National Academy of Sciences, 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20077&hyph;5576.

Executive Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee recently concluded that the evidence is consistent with a causal relation
between vaccination with DPT and acute encephalopathy (IOM, 1991), and the excess risk was estimated to range from
0 to 10.5 per million DPT immunizations. However, the same IOM committee also concluded that the evidence was insufficient
to indicate a causal relation between DPT and permanent neurologic damage (IOM, 1991). In fact, the relation between
DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction had not been studied in a rigorous scientific manner until recently. Because
the evidence has been so limited, the appearance of a single new report, a 10-year follow-up to the National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study (NCES, Miller et al., 1993), prompted the U.S. Public Health Service to ask IOM to convene the
Committee to Study New Research on Vaccines with the charge of studying the new data and, if warranted, reevaluating
the causal relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCES reported that the occurrence of hospitalization for serious neurologic disorders among 2- to 35-month-old
children is very strongly related to the occurrence of death or nervous system dysfunction (neurologic, behavioral,
educational, motor, sensory, or self-care impairment) up to 10 years (Madge et al., 1993; Miller et al. 1993). Children
who experienced the rare but serious acute neurologic disorder within 7 days after receiving DPT were no more or less
likely to experience documented chronic nervous system dysfunction or to have died within 10 years of the acute disorder
than children who had not received DPT within 7 days prior to the onset of the disorder. There were no special characteristics
associated with the acute or chronic nervous system illnesses linked to DPT exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCES did not investigate the possibility of a direct relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction,
that is, in the absence of a serious acute neurologic illness that occurs within 7 days after receiving DPT. The NCES
provides data only on the limited case of a possible relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction in
those children in whom a serious acute neurologic illness followed DPT vaccination within 7 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee posits three possible scenarios whereby the acute neurologic illnesses that follow DPT might be related
to chronic nervous system dysfunction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. DPT administration might cause serious acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic dysfunction in children
who might not have otherwise experienced either an acute neurologic illness or chronic dysfunction in the absence
of DPT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. DPT might trigger (and thereby be an immediate or proximate cause) an acute neurologic illness and subsequent chronic
dysfunction in children with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities. Such children might experience acute
neurologic illness and subsequent chronic dysfunction in association with some trigger other than DPT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. DPT might cause an acute neurologic illness in children with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities that
would themselves eventually have led to chronic dysfunction even in the absence of an acute neurologic illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee believes its conclusions take into account the fact that the data do not support any one of these scenarios
over the others. Because the NCES did not (and probably could not) rule out the possibility that only children with
underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities react to stimuli such as DPT with acute neurologic illness, and no other
studies establish or rule out such a possibility, the committee concludes that the evidence is insufficient to indicate
whether or not DPT increases the overall risk in children of chronic nervous system dysfunction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCES data are consistent with the possibility that some children without underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities
might experience serious, acute neurologic illness within 7 days after receiving DPT and that acute neurologic illness
will have chronic nervous system sequelae. The NCES data also are consistent with the possibility that some children
with underlying brain or metabolic abnormalities (which foster a ``triggering'' by DPT of an acute neurologic illness)
might go on to develop chronic nervous system dysfunction due to a DPT-triggered acute illness. Therefore, the committee
concludes that the balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relation between DPT and the forms of chronic nervous
system dysfunction described in the NCES in those children who experience a serious, acute neurologic illness within
7 days after receiving DPT vaccine. This serious, acute neurologic response to DPT is a rare event. The excess risk
has been estimated to range from 0 to 10.5 per million immunizations (IOM, 1991). The evidence does not ``establish''
or ``prove'' a causal relation. The evidence remains insufficient to indicate the presence or absence of a causal
relation between DPT and chronic nervous system dysfunction under any other circumstances. That is, because the
NCES is the only systematic study of long-term dysfunctions after DPT, the committee can only comment on the causal
relation between DPT and those long-term dysfunctions under the conditions studied by the NCES. In particular, it
should be noted that the long term dysfunctions associated with DPT followed a serious acute neurologic illness that
occurred in children within 7 days after receiving DPT.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, on its own motion, requests comments on the proposed deletion of Channel 266C1 from Pago Pago, American
Samoa. Western Samoa has recently assigned an FM station to operate on Channel 266 which conflicts with the American
Samoa allotment. Should an interest be expressed in applying for a Class C1 channel at Pago Pago, the Commission proposes
to allot Channel 226C1 as a replacement channel. Channel 226C1 can be allotted in compliance with the Commission's
minimum distance separation requirements without the imposition of a site restriction, at coordinates South Latitude
14&hyph;16&hyph;41 and West Longitude 170&hyph;42&hyph;09.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) proposes to amend the regulations that establish designated ports for
the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants by adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ports
at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees
that are listed as endangered or threatened, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), or listed
under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The USDA has adequate
facilities and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation,
and reexportation of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these three ports to the list of designated
ports would facilitate trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), requires, among other things, that plants be imported, exported,
or reexported only at designated ports or, under certain limited circumstances, at nondesignated ports. Section
9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538(f)) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of
the Interior (the Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action
would facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations contained in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened
in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be
imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in &sect;24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain
other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section
24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened
or under CITES. (The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing
the importation of plants through those ports.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of its enforcement of the Act and CITES, the Service requires that a port have personnel with expertise
in identifying endangered or threatened plants, and CITES listed plants, to ensure that such plants are properly
identified by their accompanying documentation. A port must also possess adequate facilities for holding live plants
and plant material, since plants are subject to seizure if imported, exported, or reexported in violation of the Act
or CITES. The Service further requires that, whenever possible, ports be located to coincide with established patterns
of plant trade in order to help reduce shipping costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has been asked to add the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under
CITES. Logs and lumber from listed trees may currently be imported through one of the designated ports for the importation
of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES, or through one of the USDA ports designated
for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of plants listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES.
Currently, importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico may use
only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber from
listed trees into a port in the northwestern United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consultations with the USDA, the Service has determined that the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and
Vancouver, WA, possess adequate facilities and personnel to carry out enforcement activities related to the Act
and CITES. Additionally, these locations appear to coincide with established patterns of trade. Therefore, the
Service proposes to add these ports to the list of designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from listed
trees.

Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before
the Secretary confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service will accept public hearing requests
within 45 days of the publication of this proposed rule. These requests should be sent to the Office of Management Authority
address listed in the

This proposed rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes that adding the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of designated
ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under
CITES would have a positive economic impact. These ports are significant ports of entry for logs and lumber, but they
currently may not be used to import logs and lumber from listed trees. Currently, importers wishing to import logs
and lumber from listed trees into a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico may use only Mobile, AL, New Orleans, LA, and Houston
and Brownsville, TX. Importers wishing to import logs and lumber from listed trees into a port in the northwestern
United States have only the port of Seattle, WA. Adding Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, to the list of
designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees listed as endangered or threatened or under CITES
would result in a savings in time and transportation costs for importers of logs and lumber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities, as described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).

the quality of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is taken under 50 CFR 651.26 of the regulation implementing the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management
Plan. Section 651.26 specifies a FAAS whereby protection can be provided to concentrations of juvenile, sub-legal
or spawning fish. As part of this process, the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), will initiate
a fact-finding investigation of the alleged problem. The Council will also provide an impact analysis of alternative
measures that might be implemented under this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The problem that may require measures to be taken under the FAAS is the possible discarding of large quantities of haddock,
including spawning females. This situation may present an impediment to haddock spawning success, result in significant
waste of haddock, and would be detrimental to the Council's haddock stock-rebuilding efforts. Fishermen are required
to discard haddock due to either the implementation of emergency rules to protect haddock, which include a 500-pound
(226.8 kg) haddock possession limit, or the setting of a 19-inch (14.26 cm) minimum legal size for haddock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council was alerted to this possible discard problem in early February, 1994 and initiated FAAS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The Regional Director conducted a fact-finding mission. The Committee formulated a recommendation to close an
area on the basis of the fact-finding report, an additional sea-sampling report, and information presented at a public
hearing. The Regional Director did not implement the Committee's recommendation to close the area because the information
available was inconclusive, particularly with respect to the large area under consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing to revise its regulations on the administration of its roads. These proposed
changes are necessary because of new procedures and methods, the adoption of the Federal Lands Highways Program,
and other events since the last revision. The purpose of this revision is to reflect the current Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policies for the road systems on Indian Reservations; to ensure
that funds are made available from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for construction projects on Indian Reservations
Roads (IRR) in accordance with the relative needs of the reservations; and to implement aspects of tribal self-determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing this revision to incorporate the requirements and procedures of the Federal
Lands Highways Program, 23 U.S.C. 202 and 204, and to reflect the policies of the FHWA for road systems on Indian reservations.
The incorporation of these requirements will ensure that funds from the HTF are available for construction projects
on IRR according to the needs of the reservation as prioritized by the affected Indian Tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A substantial backlog of needed road construction serving Indian reservations exists making the establishment
of project priorities a necessity. The requirements of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of
1991 (ISTEA), Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914 (December 18, 1991) and the policy of Indian Self-Determination,
mandate that consultation procedures with Tribal Governments to determine these priorities should be established,
subject to BIA approval of the expenditure of Federal Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures shall be followed and periodically revised to ensure that the opportunity exists for the various Indian
reservations to receive a fair and equitable share of funds from the HTF for construction projects on Indian reservation
roads. These projects are funded according to their relative needs and to meet the legislative requirements established
which affect Indian reservations.

This rule is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866 and, thus, will not be reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget. This rule does not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria established by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment as defined in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. This rule
does not contain information collection requirements as defined by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. which require the approval
of the Office of Management and Budget. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these
proposed regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) (2) of Executive Order 12778.
In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant
takings implications and that this rule does not have significant federalism effects under Executive Order 12612.

 Federal Lands Highways Programs (23 U.S.C. 202 and 204).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The coordinated Federal Lands Highways Program (FLHP) consists of the Forest Highways, Public Lands Highways,
Park Roads, Parkways and Indian Reservation Roads as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101. The purpose is to treat all Federal Roads
which are public roads under the same uniform policies as roads on the Federal-Aid Systems. (23 U.S.C. 204).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) BIA shall coordinate management of IRR construction with the programs of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest
Service, and the Public Lands Highways program of the FHWA. BIA management policies shall conform to policies for
roads which are on the Federal-aid highways, including application of the FAR and Government Accounting Standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In planning and constructing IRR the BIA may enter into contracts with other Federal agencies, States, counties,
cities, or tribal governments. In these contracts, the BIA or one of the other governmental agencies may be the lead
agency, accepting contributions from the other agencies involved. When the BIA is the lead agency in a cooperative
project with a State, county, local subdivision, or tribal government, reimbursement authority shall be issued
to the BIA for crediting the funds received to the appropriation available for IRR construction projects. All projects
shall be developed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic
Preservation Act, and other Federal requirements. These projects are included as part of the continuing cooperative
and comprehensive planning process used to develop Statewide transportation improvement programs by States. The
projects will also be part of approved long-range and short-range plans in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134, 135(e)(f)
and 204(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Indian labor shall be used at the maximum practical level on projects using IRR construction funds or road maintenance
funds. Since ceilings on Federal employment do not apply to construction and improvement of Indian reservation roads,
staffing and overtime decisions shall be based upon project requirements, efficiency, the availability of Indian
labor, and other governmental costs including unemployment compensation and welfare. The BIA shall assist the FHWA
and the States to apply Indian preference to Federal-aid highway projects on or near Indian reservations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The BIA shall cooperate with the FHWA in developing procedures to provide the information needed by the Secretary
of Transportation in making the determination that a proposed obligation of IRR funds on a Federal-aid project is
supplemental to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of a fair and equitable share of funds apportioned to the State pursuant
to 23 U.S.C. 104. The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a State or subdivision of a State for supplementary
funding in the construction and maintenance of IRR. At locations where road projects serve non-Indian land as well
as Indian land, State participation shall be requested. Funds for IRR may be used in conjunction with Federal-aid
funds on State Federal-aid highway projects, including projects in the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation
Program (HBRRP). Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 144(g)(4), not less than one percent of the apportioned HBRRP funds is set aside
in each State that has an Indian Reservation, as defined in 25 CFR 170.2, within its boundaries for projects to replace,
rehabilitate, paint, or apply magnesium acetate to IRR bridges. The IRR funds can also be used for the required 20 percent
State match requirements. (23 U.S.C. 144).

(f) Subject to availability of qualified Indian contractors, IRR construction contracts shall be advertised for
award to the lowest qualified bidder under the provisions of the Buy Indian Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 891). Subject
to availability of qualified Indian subcontractors, prime contractors shall be required to give preference to Indian
subcontractors on IRR construction contracts. A good faith effort to locate qualified Indian contractors and subcontractors
shall be required. Incentives may be provided for training Indian subcontractors. Contracts with tribal governments
under Public Law 93&hyph;638 shall be written, negotiated, and monitored to ensure meeting the requirements of 23
U.S.C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) On cooperative projects where Federal aid and IRR funds are used, guidelines will be developed to include procedures
for the BIA and State to negotiate the use of the Buy Indian Act (36 Stat. 891) based on the percentage of fund contribution
for the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) IRR funds can also be used on tribally-owned vocational post-secondary school road construction projects pursuant
to section 1032(d) of the ISTEA. For the purpose of this part, roads constructed under section 1032(d) are public roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The BIA, in cooperation with the FHWA and the states, will develop procedures for implementing management systems
for bridge, pavement, and safety on Indian reservation roads (23 U.S.C. 204(a)).

to promote coordination and comprehensive planning of construction activities on Indian reservations. The objectives
for conducting public hearings on proposed road projects are to: (a) Inform interested persons of the road proposals
that affect them and allow such persons to express their views at those stages of the project's development when the
flexibility to respond to these views still exists; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Ensure that road locations and designs are consistent with the reservations objectives and with applicable Federal
regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The
FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and
the Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education
Act of 1965 (HEA) as amended by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The proposed regulations would enhance the
ability of lenders and guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.

The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments
of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), enacted July 23, 1992. These regulations seek to improve the efficiency of Federal
student aid programs, and, by so doing, to improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education.

Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain
public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The purpose of the meetings was to ``provide
for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning the implementation'' of certain parts of
Public Law 102&hyph;325. In addition, attendees of the regional meetings were asked to nominate individuals to act
as negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta,
Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri during September 1992. Each participant at the regional meetings was assigned
to one of six groups which were asked to discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. Each group at
the regional meetings prepared a report of its discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented to
the Department for consideration during the preparation of the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At each regional meeting, groups discussed the statutory changes relating to repayment of loans that are addressed
in these proposed regulations. The Department considered the comments received during the regional meetings in
preparing draft proposed regulations. Below is a summary of the information received and the proposals made to the
Secretary during the regional meetings relating to these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Repayment Plans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Public Law 102&hyph;325 amended section 428(b)(1)(E) to require that borrowers be offered income-sensitive repayment
plans. Participants at all of the regional meetings discussed whether lenders were required to provide both graduated
and income-sensitive repayment plans to all borrowers or whether lenders had some discretion, but none of the groups
reached an agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at the meetings also discussed what documentation should be considered in determining an income-sensitive
repayment schedule. The participants at the Atlanta and Kansas City meetings recommended that the lender be permitted
to rely on the borrower's self-certification of income, while participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended
that the borrower be required to submit documentation reflecting income to the lender every three years. Participants
at the Atlanta and San Francisco meetings also recommended that borrowers be permitted to change repayment plans
during the repayment period, but participants at the Kansas City meeting recommended that the lender be given flexibility
to determine the borrower's repayment schedule without regulatory restrictions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Deferments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Public Law 102&hyph;325 substantially modified the deferments available to borrowers under the FFEL Program.
The deferments for borrowers who are in school or unemployed were only slightly modified, but the other specific deferments
in prior law were eliminated and replaced by a deferment for periods (up to three years) in which the borrower has or
will have an economic hardship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was extensive discussion at all of the regional meetings regarding the appropriate criteria for an economic
hardship deferment. Participants at each of the regional meetings supported a different standard for economic hardship:
participants at the New York meeting concluded that income below the minimum wage should be used as the standard for
economic hardship; participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that borrowers who relied on public assistance
and borrowers whose income did not exceed certain levels or whose debts exceeded their income should be considered
as satisfying the economic hardship criteria; the San Francisco attendees recommended that the Department consider
a variety of factors in defining economic hardship, including the ratio of debt payment to income, poverty level based
on family size, and any disabilities the borrower may have. The Kansas City participants also recommended consideration
of poverty level and analysis of debt and income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at all of the meetings generally recommended that the deferment be approved for one year at a time. However,
there were significant differences in the recommendations relating to the documentation requirements. Participants
at the Atlanta meeting identified specific documents that the attendees believed should be submitted to support
a request for an economic hardship deferment; participants at the New York meeting recommended that the Department
require ``reasonable, appropriate'' documentation; the attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that
the regulations not require the borrower to provide documentation with the application for a deferment but permit
the lender to require supporting documentation; and attendees at the Kansas City meeting recommended that the borrower
be allowed to self-certify eligibility for the deferment.

Forbearance based on income-to-debt ratio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The Department initially interpreted section 428(b)(1)(V)(ii) of the HEA to provide that the mandatory forbearance
for borrowers with a debt burden under Title IV of the Act that equals or exceeds 20 percent of the borrower's gross income
applied only to medical and dental interns. Attendees at the regional meeting in Kansas City disagreed with this view
and recommended that the Department's regulations permit all borrowers who meet the debt burden criteria to receive
the forbearance. Participants at the meeting in New York agreed with the Department's interpretation but recommended
that lenders be given the discretion to apply the debt burden standard to all borrowers. Participants at all of the
regional meetings recommended that the regulations permit lenders to base a decision regarding forbearance on income
and debt information certified by the borrower. The attendees at the Atlanta meeting specifically recommended that
the regulations permit the decision on forbearance to be based on the borrower's anticipated income for the next 12
months rather than relying on past income records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Forbearance_General Requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Public Law 102&hyph;325 amended section 428(c)(3) of the HEA to make changes in the requirements for forbearance
in the FFEL Program. Participants at all of the regional meetings agreed that the Department should allow the lender
discretion as to when to approve changes in an existing forbearance arrangement and recommended that borrower-certified
information should be sufficient to support the granting of a forbearance. In addition, attendees at the regional
meetings agreed that the period of forbearance should not be counted against the borrower's limited repayment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there was disagreement among the meeting participants on other issues. Participants at the Kansas City
regional meeting recommended the use of a single national forbearance application form, while attendees at the Atlanta
meeting recommended the use of ``local'' forms and the attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended the continuation
of current procedures. There was also disagreement as to whether a forbearance should be available to take a loan out
of default_attendees at the Kansas City and Atlanta meetings agreed that forbearance should be available for this
purpose while attendees at the New York meeting recommended that a forbearance be available only until a default claim
is submitted on the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, participants at all of the regional meetings identified a number of situations in which the regulations
could require a lender to provide administrative forbearance. Participants at all of the meetings, except Atlanta,
recommended that notice to the borrower of administrative forbearance be required, but participants at all the meetings
also recommended that the regulations not require the borrower to agree to the forbearance.

Negotiated Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After completion of the regional meetings, the Department prepared draft proposed regulations to implement the
provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;325 relating to the FFEL Program. In accordance with the requirements of section
492(b) of the HEA, those regulations were submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. During the weeks of January
4&hyph;8 and February 1&hyph;5, 1993, the Department met with negotiators selected from among individuals nominated
by attendees at the regional meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below of the proposed regulations reflects those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus
and the proposed regulations reflect that agreement. The discussion below also indicates where consensus was not
reached during the negotiations. However, the negotiators did not choose to discuss every part of these proposed
regulations. Accordingly, the discussion below of those issues not discussed during the negotiations reflects
only the views of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Regulatory Changes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.209&blank;Repayment of a Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations implement the provisions of section 428(b)(1)(E)(i) of the HEA in requiring lenders to
offer income-sensitive or graduated repayment schedules to borrowers. In developing criteria to be used by lenders
when establishing income-sensitive repayment schedules, the Secretary believes that borrowers should be required
to provide documentation of income. The Secretary therefore proposes that lenders request at least a copy of the borrower's
most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within eight months prior to the date it is requested by the
lender, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income, including, if applicable,
pay statements from employers and documentation of any income received by the borrower from other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if
the borrower's monthly payment amount is not changed whenever there is a significant increase in the borrower's income.
Therefore, the proposed regulations require an adjustment in the monthly payment amount if the borrower's disposable
income, for each of three consecutive months, exceeds twice the income upon which the payment amount is based. Similarly,
if the borrower experiences a comparable decrease in disposable income, the Secretary strongly encourages a lender
to grant a forbearance to a borrower who asks the lender for assistance, but who is ineligible for a deferment. In a notice
of proposed rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12484), the Secretary also proposes to define ``disposable income'' in &sect;682.200(b)
as that part of a borrower's compensation from an employer or other income from any source that remains after the deduction
of any amounts required by law to be withheld.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if the borrower's
monthly payment amount is dramatically increased in the later stages of the maximum repayment period to accommodate
payments that are too small in earlier years. The proposed regulations prohibit a lender from establishing a graduated
repayment plan that schedules any single installment to be greater than three times the amount of any other scheduled
installment. Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the borrower's payment amount is adjusted at least
annually. Given the fact that some borrowers may experience wide fluctuations in their income from year-to-year,
a strict adherence to the ``three times'' rule in the case of an annual adjustment to a borrower's income-sensitive
repayment schedule would not always permit the intention of a true income-sensitive schedule to be achieved. However,
the Secretary encourages lenders, whenever feasible, to attempt to establish a borrower's income-sensitive repayment
amount within the ``three times'' rule. To implement these requirements, the proposed regulations would permit
a lender to grant forbearance (which does not count against the maximum 10-year repayment period) under 34 CFR 682.211
for a period up to 3 years if the effect of an income-sensitive repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum
repayment term of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes that a fixed-amount repayment schedule be used if a borrower fails to indicate a choice
of repayment schedules, or fails to maintain eligibility for an income-sensitive repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 20,000 hours to comply with the statutory
requirement that income-sensitive repayment schedules be offered to most borrowers. The income documentation
required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months
prior to the date it is requested by the lender, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly
disposable income) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the amount of the borrower's installment
payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.210&blank;Deferment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations implement the requirements of section 428(b)(1)(M)(iii) of the HEA. During the negotiations,
a point of contention was the requirements a borrower must meet to qualify for an economic hardship deferment. In developing
criteria to be used by lenders when granting an economic hardship deferment to a borrower based on the borrower's income
and debt-to-income ratio, as required by section 435(o)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary believes that borrowers should
be required to provide documentation of income. The Secretary therefore proposes that lenders obtain at least a copy
of the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is
requested, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if
a borrower who has the means to repay the loan does not do so. Therefore, the Secretary proposes an income limitation
on a borrower who requests an economic hardship deferment based on income and debt-to-income ratio. The Secretary
believes the income cap in the proposed regulations_no more than four times the minimum wage or four times the poverty
line for a family of two_is reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public, at the regional meetings in September, and through its negotiators, did not agree on the definition of
``debt'' or the precise ratio to be used when comparing debt to income. In the Secretary's view, it would not be appropriate
to include all debts that a borrower owed in developing the debt-to-income ratio. In a related section of the HEA (section
437A(c)) that evaluates a borrower's debt-to-income ratio to determine if a borrower has a high risk of defaulting
on a loan, only the borrower's FFEL Program debts are considered. Therefore, the Secretary believes that for the purpose
of establishing the borrower's eligibility for an economic hardship deferment, a similar evaluation should be used.
The proposed regulations reflect the Secretary's belief that the calculation of ``debt'' for this purpose should
include only the monthly amount due on the borrower's non-defaulted education loans that were obtained through a
program administered by any agency of the Federal government. Given the ease with which borrowers can remove a default
status from an FFEL Program loan through a guaranty agency's loan rehabilitation program, a conscientious borrower
with a defaulted FFEL Program loan is not likely to be harmed by this restriction solely because of the defaulted loan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for the debt-to-income ratio to be used, the Secretary notes that the HEA has created a mandatory forbearance for
a borrower who has a Title IV debt-to-income ratio that equals or exceeds 20 percent. Since a deferment during which
the borrower's interest is paid by the federal government provides a much greater financial benefit to a borrower
than a forbearance, it would be logical to establish a similar standard for a borrower to meet to qualify for a deferment.
Therefore, in the Secretary's opinion, the 20 percent ratio is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 14,000 hours to process the statutorily
required economic hardship deferments for borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The income and debt documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return
if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender; evidence showing the amount of
the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income; and evidence showing the most recent monthly amount due on
the borrower's non-defaulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education loans (or eligible defaulted loans) that were obtained through a Federal program) is needed to obtain verifiable
data to accurately determine the borrower's eligibility to receive an economic hardship deferment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 682.211&blank;Forbearance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the rationale expressed earlier with regard to income-sensitive repayment schedules and economic
hardship deferments, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer
if a borrower who has the means to repay the loan does not do so. The Secretary proposes that, in order to qualify for a
mandatory general forbearance under &sect;682.211(i)(2)_which permits a borrower to postpone making scheduled
loan payments_a borrower should be required to provide at least a copy of his or her most recent Federal income tax return
if one had been filed within six months prior to the date the forbearance is requested, and evidence showing the amount
of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income. In conformance with section 428(b)(1)(V) of the HEA, this
requirement does not apply if the borrower is a medical or dental intern or resident, as described in &sect;682.211(i)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments received at the regional meetings and other information provided to the Secretary from other sources,
the Secretary has concluded that the public's views concerning the general applicability of the use of an administrative
forbearance to assist a borrower in avoiding default should be reflected in the proposed regulations. The Secretary
agrees that it would be in the best interests of borrowers and taxpayers to require lenders to grant administrative
forbearance to borrowers or endorsers under the exceptional conditions described in &sect;682.211(j), such as
emergencies and national disasters, whereas the granting of the forbearances authorized under &sect;682.211(f)
is best left to the judgement of the lender on a case-by-case basis. The proposed regulations would permit a lender
to grant forbearance under &sect;682.211 for a period of up to 3 years if the effect of an income-sensitive repayment
schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment term of the loan, and up to one year if the effect of a variable
interest rate on a fixed-amount or graduated repayment schedule similarly causes the extension of the maximum repayment
term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 15,000 hours to process mandatory forbearances
for borrowers. The income and debt documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income
tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender; evidence showing the
amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income; and evidence showing the most recent monthly amount
due on the borrower or endorser's Title IV loans) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the borrower
or endorser's eligibility to receive a mandatory forbearance.

These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently, as
discussed in those sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the regulations. Burdens specifically
associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble
under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere
with state, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements are imposed on lenders by the regulations. These

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, however, would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 682.209, 682.210, and 682.211 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations affect lenders that participate in the FFEL Program. The Department needs and uses the information
to properly carry out its responsibility to administer certain aspects of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information by approximately 7,500 lending institutions
participating in the FFEL Program is expected to increase by a total of 49,000 hours. The collection and reporting
of the information in &sect;682.209(a) is expected to occur two million times per year, with each occurrence requiring
lender processing time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 20,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information
in &sect;682.210(s)(6) is expected to occur 1.4 million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing
time of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 14,000 hours. The collection and reporting of the information in &sect;682.211
(i) and (j) is expected to occur 1.5 million times per year, with each occurrence requiring lender processing time
of 0.01 hours, for a total increase of 15,000 hours.

(iii) Not more than six months prior to the date that the borrower's first payment is due, the lender shall offer a choice
of a fixed-amount, graduated, or income-sensitive repayment schedule to a new borrower who receives a Stafford or
SLS loan first disbursed on or after July 1, 1993. For purposes of this section, a ``new borrower'' is an individual
who has no outstanding principal or interest balance on an FFEL Program loan as of July 1, 1993 or on the date he or she
obtains a loan on or after July 1, 1993. This term also includes a borrower who obtains a Federal Consolidation Loan
on or after July 1, 1993 if the borrower has no other outstanding FFEL Program loan when the Consolidation Loan is made.
The lender shall also offer a choice of repayment schedules to any individual whose Consolidation loan application
is received by the lender on or after January 1, 1993. The Secretary encourages lenders to offer the choice of repayment
schedules to all other borrowers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The repayment schedule must require that each payment equal at least the interest that accrues during the interval
between scheduled payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan under a fixed-amount repayment schedule described in paragraph
(a)(6)(vi) of this section if the borrower does not select, or does not qualify for, an income-sensitive or a graduated
repayment schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Under a fixed-amount repayment schedule, the borrower is scheduled to pay the same amount for each installment
payment made during the repayment period, except that the borrower's final payment may be slightly more or less than
the other payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Under a graduated repayment schedule, the amount of the borrower's installment payment is scheduled to change
(usually by increasing) during the course of the repayment period. If a graduated repayment schedule is established,
it may not provide for any single installment that is more than three times greater than any other installment. An agreement
as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is not required if the schedule provides for less than the minimum
annual payment amount specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) (A) Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the amount of the borrower's installment payment is adjusted
annually, based on the borrower's expected monthly disposable income, as defined in &sect;682.200(b), during the
course of the repayment period. The Secretary encourages lenders to develop income-sensitive repayment schedules
that do not result in any single installment that is more than three times greater than any other installment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The lender shall inform the borrower that the loan must be repaid within the time limits specified under paragraph
(a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) No earlier than 90 days prior to the due date of the borrower's initial installment payment and subsequent annual
payment adjustment under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the lender shall request documentation from
the borrower sufficient for the lender to make a reasonable determination of what the borrower's payment amount should
be. The lender shall require the borrower to submit at least the following documentation:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

parties.

date the lender requested it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the borrower fails to provide the documentation described in paragraph (a)(6)(viii)(C) of this section, the
lender shall require the borrower to repay the loan in accordance with either a fixed-amount or a graduated repayment
schedule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(E) The agreement between the borrower and lender must specify that if, at any time, the borrower's monthly disposable
income for each of three consecutive months exceeds twice the income upon which the current installment amount is
calculated, the borrower must inform the lender of that fact within 30 days after receiving the income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Not later than 30 days after learning from the borrower or other sources that the borrower's monthly disposable
income has exceeded twice the amount upon which the current installment amount is calculated for each of three consecutive
months, the lender shall notify the borrower that, unless the borrower provides documentation showing that information
to be incorrect or, if it is correct, that the borrower's monthly disposable income has since decreased to the level
that the payment amount had been based on, the amount of the borrower's installment payment will be increased commensurately,
beginning with the second payment due after the date the lender notifies the borrower of the new payment amount.
