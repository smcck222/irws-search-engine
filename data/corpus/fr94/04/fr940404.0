<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim
final rule that authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the California Desert Grape Administrative
Committee (Committee) under Marketing Order No. 925 for the 1994 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables
the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer its program. Funds to administer
the program are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order and Agreement No. 925 (7 CFR part 925) regulating the handling of table
grapes grown in a designated area of California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, table grapes grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate
specified herein will be applicable to all assessable grapes handled during the 1994 fiscal year, which began January
1, 1994, through December 31, 1994. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of grapes subject to regulation under the marketing order each season. In addition,
there are approximately 90 producers of table grapes in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been
defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The marketing order requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year shall apply to all assessable grapes
handled from the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to
the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of the regulated commodity.
They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area
and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting.
Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of table grapes. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budgets and rates of assessment are
usually acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis.
Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Desert Grape Administrative Committee met on November 4, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total
expense amount of $103,544, which is $75,056 less in expenses than the previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.01 per lug for the 1994 fiscal year, which is $0.01
less in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments
of 9,000,000 lugs, would yield $90,000 in assessment income. This along with $2,500 in interest income and $113,000
from the Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $50,000 for a U.C. Riverside research grant, $24,000 for
the Western Grape Leaf Skeletonizer project, $11,704 for salaries, and $4,340 for rent. Funds in the reserve at the
end of the fiscal year, estimated at $101,956, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action was issued as an interim final rule on January 13, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 3316, January 21, 1994). A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994 fiscal year for the program began on January 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable table grapes handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are
aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brucellosis is a contagious disease affecting animals and man, caused by bacteria of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The brucellosis regulations contained, in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations), provide a system for
classifying States or portions of States according to the rate of Brucella infection present, and the general effectiveness
of a brucellosis control and eradication program. The classifications are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class
C. States or areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are required to be placed under Federal quarantine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no known brucellosis in cattle for the 12 months
preceding classification as Class Free. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highest rate of
brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes. Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become
less stringent as a State approaches or achieves Class Free status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entail maintaining (1) a cattle herd infection
rate not to exceed a stated level during 12 consecutive months; (2) a rate of infection in the cattle population (based
on the percentage of brucellosis reactors found in the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) program_a program of testing
at stockyards, farms, ranches, and slaughter establishments) not to exceed a stated level; (3) a surveillance system
that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all recognized slaughtering establishments in the MCI program,
identification and monitoring of herds at high risk of infection (including herds adjacent to infected herds and
herds from which infected animals have been sold or received), and having an individual herd plan in effect within
a stated number of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosis in a herd he or she owns; and (4)
minimum procedural standards for administering the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the effective date of this interim rule, California was classified as a Class A State because of its herd infection
rate and its MCI reactor prevalence rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To attain and maintain Class Free status, a State or area must (1) remain free from field strain Brucella abortus

infection for 12 consecutive months or longer; (2) maintain for 12 consecutive months an MCI reactor prevalence rate
not to exceed one reactor per 2,000 cattle tested (0.050 percent); and (3) have a specified surveillance system, as
described above, including an approved individual herd plan in effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or
recipient herd. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the brucellosis program records for California, we have concluded that the State meets the standards
for Class Free status. Therefore, we are removing California from the list of Class A States in &sect;78.41(b) and
adding it to the list of Class Free States in &sect;78.41(a). This action relieves certain restrictions on moving
cattle interstate from California.

Immediate Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to remove unnecessary
restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock, or for feeding. Changing the brucellosis
status of California from Class A to Class Free will promote economic growth by reducing certain testing and other
requirements governing the interstate movement of cattle from the State. Testing requirements for cattle moved
interstate for immediate slaughter or to quarantined feedlots are not affected by this change. Cattle from certified
brucellosis-free herds moving interstate are not affected by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The groups affected by this action will be herd owners in California, as well as buyers and importers of cattle from
the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 28,000 cattle herds in California that would be affected by this rule. Ninety-eight percent
of these are owned by small entities. Most of these herds are not certified-free. Test-eligible cattle offered for
sale from other than certified-free herds must have a negative test under present Class A status regulations, but
not under regulations concerning Class Free status. This testing costs approximately $3.25 per head. If such testing
were distributed equally among all herds affected by this rule, Class Free status would save approximately $16 per
herd. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we believe that changing the brucellosis status for California would not have a significant economic
impact on the small entities affected by this interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CT58&hyph;110
and &hyph;140 series turboshaft engines. This action supersedes priority letter AD 93&hyph;10&hyph;09 that currently
requires inspection of the forward and aft cooling plate locating groove or channel (rabbet groove) of stage 1 and
stage 2 turbine wheels for cracks and minimum radii, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable turbine wheels.
In addition, that AD reduces the cyclic life limit of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels based on the cycles since
new and the rabbet groove radius. This action retains the inspection requirements of the current priority letter
AD, but adds an additional eddy current inspection of the stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels, accelerates the inspection
schedule, reduces the cyclic life limit of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels below the published limits and
those imposed by the priority letter AD, and provides for the removal from service of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine
wheels. This amendment is prompted by an extensive analytical study performed by GE as a result of an uncontained stage
2 turbine wheel failure on a GE Model CT58&hyph;140&hyph;1 turboshaft engine. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 20, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued priority letter airworthiness directive (AD)
93&hyph;10&hyph;09, applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CT58 series turboshaft engines, which requires
inspection of the forward and aft cooling plate locating rabbet groove or channel of stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels
for cracks and minimum radii, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable turbine wheels. In addition, that
AD reduces the cyclic life limit of stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels to 4,200 cycles since new (CSN) for wheels with
3,000 or less CSN on the effective date of that AD, and that, upon inspection, have a rabbet groove radius of less than
0.010 inches. That action was prompted by an investigation into a stage 2 uncontained turbine wheel failure on a GE
Model CT58&hyph;140&hyph;1 turboshaft engine. That condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained
engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that priority letter AD, the FAA received the results of an extensive analytical study performed
by GE as a result of the noted stage 2 turbine wheel failure. The study indicates that a crack initiated in the inboard
radius of the rabbet groove on the forward side of the wheel. The fatigue crack propagated 360
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; around the wheel, and approximately 300
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; of the wheel departed in the failure. The wheel failure has been attributed to an under minimum radius that results
in reduced low cycle fatigue capability. The results of this study also indicate that the minimum calculated lives
for certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels, regardless of the forward and aft rabbet groove radii, are significantly
lower than the published limits and those imposed by the priority letter AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CT58 Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72&hyph;126 (CEB&hyph;206),
Revision 2, dated August 31, 1993, that describes the revised inspection requirements, accelerated inspection
schedule, and the removal from service of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
this AD supersedes priority letter AD 93&hyph;10&hyph;09 to add an additional eddy current inspection requirement,
accelerate the inspection schedule, and provide for the removal from service of certain stage 1 and stage 2 turbine
wheels. The priority letter AD referred to the stage 1 and stage 2 turbine wheels as high pressure turbine disks. In
order to be consistent with the SB described previously, the terminology has been changed in this final rule to turbine
wheel. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the SB described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

ADDRESSES. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules

This action amends the Lakeview, Oregon, Class E airspace. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above ground
level (AGL) is necessary for a new instrument approach procedure to Lakeview County Airport, Lakeview, Oregon. Airspace
reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing
it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the Lakeview, Oregon, Class E airspace (59 FR 1681). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth is now Class E airspace. This
amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice except the docket number of this action is corrected to read 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;36
vice 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;39, and that airspace extending upward from 10,500 feet MSL, which previously existed, is
added to the description in this document. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending 700 feet or
more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Lakeview, Oregon, to provide
controlled airspace for aircraft executing a new instrument approach procedure at Lakeview County Airport, Lakeview,
Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On September 7, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
V&hyph;561 located in North Dakota and South Dakota (58 FR 47087). Interested parties were invited to participate
in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to
the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice.
Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airway listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes V&hyph;561 located in North Dakota and
South Dakota. Establishing a direct route between these points will provide controlled airspace and allow aircraft
to operate efficiently and expeditiously along this route. This action is necessary to improve navigation and save
on fuel consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This action amends the Medford, Oregon, Class E airspace. This action is necessary to accommodate an amended instrument
approach procedure and missed approach holding pattern at Medford-Jackson County Airport, Medford, Oregon. Airspace
reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing
it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the Medford, Oregon, Class E airspace (59 FR 1682). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice except during the comment period an error was discovered in
the coordinates of the Rogue Valley VORTAC and the Klamath Falls VORTAC. The errors are corrected in this document.
Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 6004 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Lakeview, Oregon, to accommodate
an amended instrument approach procedure at the Medford-Jackson County Airport, Medford, Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action amends the Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Spokane, Washington Class E airspace. Controlled airspace is necessary
to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at Coeur d'Alene Air Terminal, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Airspace
reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing
it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 12, 1994 the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Spokane, Washington, Class E airspace (59 FR 1684). Interested parties were invited
to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments
objecting to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph
6004 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,
and Spokane, Washington, to provide controlled airspace for aircraft executing a new instrument approach procedure
at Coeur d'Alene Air Terminal, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPs criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``major
rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) has agreed to cease functioning on March 31,
1994. The current control lists will be retained by the member nations until a successor regime is established. To
help make the transition, the United States is establishing a new General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
License GLX, which will allow certain shipments to civil end-users and end-uses in formerly proscribed destinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This new general license will reduce paperwork and licensing delays for exporters, and will focus controls on exports
that are of direct strategic concern.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The international security environment has changed in the past few years. As a result, the United States and our COCOM
partners are revamping approaches to export controls to deal with the new challenges of the Post-Cold War era. In this
regard, the members of COCOM agreed to end the Cold War regime on March 31, 1994, and to work together to establish a new
arrangement aimed at enhancing transparency and restraint in arms sales and transfer of sensitive technology to
countries and regions of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As these discussions progress, the members of COCOM have agreed to retain the current COCOM Lists and the COCOM secretariat
until a new successor regime with its own control list and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional support is established. However, the members have also agreed to modify former COCOM export licensing
procedures by making all licensing decisions subject to national discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the United States is establishing a new General License GLX for shipments to formerly COCOM proscribed
destinations of many items that previously required an Individual Validated License. With certain important exceptions
and additions noted in this regulation, the new GLX general license will be available for the items previously covered
by Administrative Exception Notes in the Commerce Control List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, General License GFW is revised to permit export to eligible countries of those commodities that can be shipped
to QWY and the PRC under GLX but have not been eligible for GFW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States will continue to work with the other former COCOM member countries to coordinate transitional licensing
policies and procedures and to establish the new arrangement. As these efforts progress, there will be additional
modifications to U.S. export licensing requirements.

Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This final rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). This collection has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005,
0694&hyph;0007, and 0694&hyph;0010. Licensing requirements will be reduced as a result of this rule, thereby reducing
the paperwork burden on the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves
a foreign and military affairs function of the United States. This rule does not impose a new control. No other law requires
that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, it is issued in final form. However, comments from the public are always welcome. Comments should be
submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department
of Commerce, P.O.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 771.20, formerly reserved, is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;771.20 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
General License GLX; exports to Country Groups QWY and the People's Republic of China.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A general license designated GLX is established, authorizing exports to civil end-users in Country Group QWY and
the People's Republic of China (PRC) of certain specified items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible exports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The items eligible for this general license are those described in the Advisory Notes in the CCL that indicate likelihood
of approval for ``Country Groups QWY and the PRC,'' except items described in the notes to ECCNs 1C18A and 2B18A. Likelihood
of approval notes that apply only to the PRC, or to specified destinations in Country Group Y, also qualify for this
general license to all eligible destinations (however, those notes indicating Country Group Q or W, but not Y, or individual
countries in Q or W, are specifically not eligible). In addition, those entries and sub-entries listed in Supplement
No. 1 to this Part 771 are eligible for export under this general license. However, this general license is not available
for items that are also subject to missile technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), or foreign policy (FP)
controls to the recipient country.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible consignees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This general license is available only for exports to civil end-users for civil end-uses. Exports under this general
license may not be made to military end-users or to known military uses. Such exports will continue to require an individual
validated license and be considered on a case-by-case basis. In addition to conventional military activities, military
uses include any proliferation activities described in Part 778 of this subchapter. Retransfers to military end-users
or end-uses in eligible countries are strictly prohibited without prior authorization.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 21, 1989 (54 FR 7519), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 9B4123) had been filed by E.I. du
Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, DE 19898. The petition proposed that the food additive regulations in part 173

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Secondary Direct Food Additives Permitted in Food for Human Consumption
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR part 173) be amended to provide for the safe use of a fluorocarbon resin, manufactured by the reaction of tetrafluoroethylene
and perfluoro(4-methyl-3,6-dioxa-7-octene-1-sulfonyl fluoride), and followed by hydrolysis of the sulfonyl
fluoride group to sulfonic acid, for use as a membrane to process food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe, and that part 173 should be amended by adding new &sect;173.21 to subpart A, as set forth below.
The additive was described in the filing noitce by nomenclature commonly used in industry. In accordance with agency
policy, the listing in new &sect;173.21 uses Chemical Abstracts nomenclature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before May 4, 1994, file with the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and
each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is
made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal
drug application (NADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The NADA provides for expanding the use of currently
approved bambermycins-containing Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds for increased rate of
weight gain in pasture cattle.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206 North, P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258, has filed
NADA 141&hyph;034. The NADA provides for expanding the use of currently approved 2-, 4-, and 10-gram-per-pound bambermycins-containing
Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds for increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle (as in related
NADA 44&hyph;759 which covers broiler chickens, growing-finishing swine, growing turkeys, and cattle fed in confinement
for slaughter). The NADA is approved as of March 4, 1994, and the regulations are amended in &sect;558.95(b) (21 CFR
558.95(b)) to reflect the approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in 21 CFR 558.4(a) and (d), bambermycins are Category I drugs, which as the sole drug ingredient, do not
require an approved Form FDA 1900 for making Type C medicated feeds as in approved NADA 141&hyph;034 and in &sect;558.95,
as amended herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this
approval for food-producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning March 4, 1994, because
the application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) and, in the case of food-producing animals, human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing
exclusivity applies only to the claim of increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle for which the application
is being approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

The Department of State is amending the ITAR to reflect that it is no longer the policy of the United States to, pursuant
to 22 CFR 126.1, deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined
for or originating in the following countries: Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.
With respect to these countries, all requests for approval involving items covered by the U.S. Munitions List (22

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, this action is taken in response to the
great progress made by these countries in transforming themselves from authoritarian, one-party communist regimes
to free market democracies. Cambodia is removed from the provisions of &sect;126.1(a) as a result of the installation
of a new and democratically-elected government, and the end of multifactional civil conflict that plagued the country
for over a decade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 126.1(a) is amended to add Haiti as a result of the UN arms embargo against it, and &sect;126.1(d) is amended
to add Sudan, which was designated by the Secretary of State on August 12, 1993 as a country which has repeatedly provided
support for acts of international terrorism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A &sect;126.1(f) is added to reflect the qualified embargo of Angola which is set forth in Executive Order 12865 of
September 26, 1993 and which is also implemented by the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations published by the Office
of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, at 58 FR 64904.

 It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and
defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This policy applies to Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Cuba, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea, Russia, South
Africa, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. This policy also applies to countries
with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan,
the former Yugoslavia, and Zaire) or whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the
security and foreign policy of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State
Department notice published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document EPA is approving as a direct final rule Tennessee's petition to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure Standard
(RVP) applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 in the former Knox County ozone nonattainment
area from 7.8 pounds per square inches (psi) to 9.0 psi. Knox County, Tennessee has met the requirements for redesignation
from nonattainment to attainment status contained in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act. Tennessee's petition
is based on evidence that the Knox County area does not need the 7.8 psi standard to maintain ozone attainment. EPA believes
that further imposition of the 7.8 psi volatility standard would impose needless costs in light of Tennessee's attainment
of the National Ambient Air Quality standard. This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes
that this final rulemaking is noncontroversial, for the reasons discussed above and due to the limited scope of this
rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice describes EPA's final action to approve Tennessee's request to change the federal Reid Vapor Pressure
(RVP) standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi in the former Knox County ozone nonattainment area from June 1 to September 15. The
remainder of this notice is divided into five parts. Section II provides the background for this action. Section III
provides the Agency's policy regarding relaxation of volatility standards in nonattainment areas redesignated
as attainment. Section IV reviews the Tennessee request and supporting evidence. Section V reviews EPA's redesignation
of Knox County as attainment. Finally, Section VI presents EPA's action and rationale.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 19, 1987, EPA proposed a two-phase national program to reduce summertime gasoline volatility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA found that gasoline had become increasingly volatile, which caused an increase in evaporative emissions from
gasoline-powered sources. These emissions are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a precursor of ozone. These gasoline-related
emissions are currently a major contributor to the nation's serious ground level ozone problem, which harms human
health and the public welfare. The Agency published a Notice of Final Rulemaking on March 22, 1989 that promulgated
Phase I of the program to require VOC reductions by the beginning of the 1989 summer ozone season.

The final rule for the Phase I program established a federal volatility standard in Tennessee of 10.5 psi for the months
of May and June, 9.5 for July and August, and 10.5 for September 1 through September 15. The Phase II rule required a further
reduction in the volatility standard to 9.0 psi for May and 7.8 psi for June 1 through September 15 beginning in 1992.
The Phase I and Phase II standards were applicable on a statewide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress established slightly different requirements for the fuel volatility program in the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. Section 211(h)(1) of the Act, as amended, required that EPA promulgate regulations making it unlawful to
sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport, or introduce into commerce, gasoline with an
RVP level in excess of 9.0 psi during the high ozone season as defined by the Administrator. It further provides that
EPA shall establish more stringent RVP standards in nonattainment areas if EPA finds such standards are ``necessary
to achieve comparable evaporative emissions reductions, on a per vehicle basis, in such areas, taking into consideration
the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emissions control, and economic factors.'' Section
211(h) prohibits the regulations from establishing a volatility standard more stringent than 9.0 psi in an attainment
area, although it allows EPA to impose a lower standard in any former ozone nonattainment area which is redesignated
as being in attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 29, 1991, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which modified the Phase II summer ozone volatility
standards to reflect new section 211(h) of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this notice, EPA proposed that, beginning in 1992, the RVP standard be 9.0 psi in all attainment areas where this
standard was not already in place. The effect of this proposal was to prohibit the sale of gasoline with a Reid Vapor
Pressure above 9.0 psi during the summer ozone season in all areas designated attainment for ozone for 1992 and beyond.
For areas that have been designated as nonattainment, EPA proposed that the original Phase II standards published
on June 11, 1990 should not be changed. On December 12, 1991 EPA finalized these modifications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 6, 1991, EPA issued its ozone nonattainment designations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to section 107(d)(1)(C) of the Act, as amended. In the November 6, 1991 notice, EPA designated Knox County
as a ``marginal'' nonattainment area for ozone. Under the original Phase II rule, a statewide standard was established
in Tennessee that required 7.8 psi gasoline to be provided from June 1 to September 15. In the December 12, 1991 final
rule, EPA modified RVP standards for Tennessee to require that those areas designated in Tennessee as nonattainment
in the November 6, 1991 notice be provided with 7.8 psi gasoline, and that the remainder of Tennessee be supplied with
9.0 psi gasoline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. EPA Policy Regarding Relaxation of Volatility Standards in Nonattainment Areas Redesignated as Attainment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the amended Phase II regulations, any change in the volatility standard for an area must be accomplished through
a separate rulemaking revising the applicable standard for that area, even for an area that was designated as nonattainment
in the November 6, 1991 notice but is subsequently redesignated as being in attainment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, for nonattainment areas where EPA mandated a phase II volatility standard of 7.8 psi RVP in the December 12, 1991
rulemaking, the 7.8 psi standard will remain in effect, even after such an area is redesignated as being in attainment,
until a separate rulemaking is completed that revises the RVP standard in that area from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Relaxation of RVP standards associated with the redesignation process was discussed in the preamble to EPA's final
rule modifying the Phase II volatility standards (56 FR 64706, December 12, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, when an area originally designated being in attainment is redesignated nonattainment, the volatility
level of the gasoline will stay at 9.0 psi RVP unless and until EPA promulgates a rulemaking changing the RVP in that
area (56 FR 64706 December 12, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that relaxation of any RVP standard change is best accomplished in conjunction with the redesignation
process. In order for an ozone nonattainment area to be redesignated as being in attainment for ozone, revised section
107(d)(3) of the Act requires the state to make a showing, pursuant to section 175A of the Act, that the area is capable
of maintaining attainment for the ozone NAAQS for ten years. This maintenance plan may demonstrate that the area is
capable of maintaining attainment for ten years without the more stringent volatility standard. However, the maintenance
plan could also show that the more stringent volatility standard is or may be necessary for the area to maintain its
attainment with the ozone NAAQS. Therefore, in the context of a request for redesignation, the Agency will not relax
the volatility standard unless the maintenance plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Agency that the area
will maintain attainment for ten years without the need for the more stringent volatility standard.

As stated in the preamble for the Agency's initial Phase II volatility standards (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
55 FR 23609), and in the preamble in the proposal to revise those standards (56 FR 24244), EPA may also promulgate a rule
to revise the volatility standard in a particular nonattainment area in order to enhance local air quality and/or
increase the economic efficiency of the program. The Governor of a state, or his designee, may petition EPA for a less
stringent standard if such a standard is consistent with the requirements of the Act and if the state can document (1)
particular local economic impact that makes the less stringent standard appropriate and (2) sufficient alternative
programs to achieve attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone.

IV. Tennessee's Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan; Request for Change in Federal RVP Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 26, 1992, the State of Tennessee, through the Tennessee Department of Conservation and Environment, submitted
to EPA both a request to redesignate Knox County (classified as a marginal nonattainment area) from nonattainment
to attainment for ozone and a maintenance plan. The redesignation request was based on three years of ambient monitoring
data which showed that Knox County had no violations of the ozone standard during the three year period of 1989 through
1991, and was also based on Tennessee's implementation of EPA-approved ozone control strategies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accompanying the redesignation request was a request to revise the Federal RVP standard for Knox County from 7.8 psi
to 9.0 psi. Tennessee's maintenance demonstration assumed a 9.0 psi standard for RVP. EPA deferred action on the relaxation
of the RVP standard until after redesignation was completed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 18, 1993 the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation re-asserted its request that
the EPA revise the Federal RVP standard from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi for Knox County. A copy of the letter, signed by Mr. John
W. Walton, P.E., Director, Tennessee, Division of Air Pollution Control, has been placed in the docket at the location

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in that determination were findings that the area had attained the NAAQS for ozone, that the improvements
in air quality were due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions, and that the Administrator has fully approved
a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of section 175A of the Act.

Section 175A sets forth requirements for maintenance plans. Section 175A(a) requires each State which submits a
redesignation request under section 107(d) to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision to provide for maintenance
of the applicable air quality standard for at least 10 years after redesignation. Section 175A(d) requires inclusion
in the SIP of such contingency measures as the EPA Administrator deems necessary to assure the State will promptly
correct any violation of the standard which occurs after redesignation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The finding that the area had attained the NAAQS for ozone was based on the data indicating that Knox County had no violations
in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The finding that permanent enforceable VOC emissions reductions have been obtained was based
on evidence that emissions had been reduced in Knox County as a result of the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program
(FMVCP) and reduced gasoline RVP requirements effective in 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In finding that the maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 175A, EPA cited the elements of the plan discussed
above. EPA noted that the plan relied on a gasoline volatility level of 9.0 psi RVP, not 7.8 psi, as is required under
current regulations. Moreover, the final rule found that Knox County had demonstrated that it can maintain the ozone
NAAQS using the less stringent volatility level of 9.0 psi RVP. On that basis, the maintenance plan was approved. No
significant comments were received subsequently and the redesignation of Knox County to attainment for ozone became
effective October 27, 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Today's Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today relaxing the RVP standard for Knox County, Tennessee from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. The effective date of this
rule is on June 3, 1994. Tennessee has met the criteria for relaxation of the RVP standard discussed in the December
12, 1991 notice. The State has in place a fully approved implementation plan for Knox County that demonstrates that
the county can maintain the ozone NAAQS with a 9.0 psi standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee's approved implementation and maintenance plan does not require a RVP standard more stringent than 9.0
psi. EPA's approval of this plan was based on evidence that the Knox County area can maintain ozone attainment for ten
years with a 9.0 psi standard. Based upon the approval of the maintenance plan, EPA believes sufficient alternative
programs are in place to achieve attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS and that further imposition of the 7.8
psi volatility standard would impose needless costs to consumers.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 29, 1991 notice proposing to modify the Phase II volatility standards, EPA estimated that the 7.8 psi standard
will increase the cost of gasoline by approximately 1.1 cents per gallon over the 9.0 psi standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this relaxation in the RVP regulation
is noncontroversial, the effect of this rulemaking is limited to Knox County, Tennessee, and EPA anticipates no significant
comments on this action. Today's action is based on the same information that EPA relied on in its approval of Tennessee's
maintenance plan. EPA received no significant adverse comments regarding its approval of the maintenance plan or
the redesignation of Knox County to attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public should be advised that this action will be effective 60 days from the date of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, unless notice is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If such
notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published. One notice, which
will be published before the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another notice will begin a new rulemaking
by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons are invited to submit
comments on this proposed approval. EPA will consider all comments received within thirty days of the publication
of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, this procedure still allows the opportunity for public comment and opportunity for oral presentation
of data that is required under CAA section 307(d). This procedure merely provides an expedited procedure for final
action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial and no adverse comment is expected.

VII. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment is not expected to cause Knox County to violate the NAAQS for ozone. The Knox County nonattainment area
has met the NAAQS since 1989. That is, Knox County, has not recorded an exceedance during the time when the RVP standard
in Knox County was no more stringent than 9.0 psi. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relaxation of the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 psi will result in a cost savings to consumers of approximately 1.1 cents
per gallon at the pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Administrative Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory
flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations
and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. In such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I certify that these regulations will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulatory revision is limited to the Knox County area and should
have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These regulations, therefore, do
not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore
subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Specifically, this rule will not have an annual effect on the economy
in excess of $100 million, have a significant adverse impact on competition, investment, employment or innovation,
or result in a major price increase. In fact, as discussed above, this action will reduce the cost of compliance with
Federal requirements in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, EPA must obtain OMB clearance for any activity that will
involve collecting substantially the same information from 10 or more non-Federal respondents. This direct final
rule does not create any new information requirements or contain any new information collection activities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's action EPA is issuing as a direct final rule approving the State of Colorado's petition to relax the Reid
Vapor Pressure (RVP) Standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce in the Denver-Boulder ozone nonattainment
area from June 1 to September 15 from 7.8 pounds per square inches (psi) to 9.0 psi for the years 1994 and 1995. Federal
RVP standards were promulgated by EPA on June 11, 1990 and revised on December 12, 1991, pursuant to the Clean Air Act,
as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act). Colorado's petition is based on evidence that the Denver-Boulder
area does not need the 7.8 psi standard to maintain ozone attainment in the near term and that the 7.8 psi standard would
impose significant costs on industry and consumers. Colorado's petition requests a continuation of a previous relaxation
for the RVP standard approved by the EPA for the years 1992 and 1993. This action is being taken without prior notice
because EPA believes that this rulemaking is noncontroversial due to the limited scope of this rulemaking, Colorado's
continued attainment of the ozone standard and for the reasons discussed in this notice.

On August 19, 1987, EPA proposed a two-phase national program to reduce summertime gasoline volatility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA found that gasoline had become increasingly volatile, which caused an increase in evaporative emissions from
gasoline powered sources. These emissions are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a precursor of ozone and a major
contributor to the nation's serious ground level ozone problem which results in harm to human health and to the public
welfare. The Agency published a Notice of Final Rulemaking on March 22, 1989 that put into place Phase I of the program
to require VOC reductions available through refining changes that could be accomplished by the beginning of the 1989
summer ozone season.

The final rule for the Phase I program established a federal volatility standard in Colorado of 10.5 psi for the month
of May, and 9.5 for June through September 15. The Phase II rule required a further reduction in the volatility standard
to 9.0 psi for May and 7.8 psi for June 1 through September 15 beginning in 1992. Under the Phase I and Phase II approach,
the gasoline volatility levels were applicable on a state-wide basis.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, however, established new requirements for the fuel volatility program. Section
211(h) of the Act as amended required that EPA modify the Phase II fuel volatility program. Section 211(h)(1) requires
that EPA promulgate regulations making it unlawful to sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport,
or introduce into commerce, gasoline with an RVP level in excess of 9.0 psi during the high ozone season as defined by
the Administrator. It further provides that EPA shall establish more stringent RVP standards in nonattainment areas
if EPA finds such standards are ``necessary to achieve comparable evaporative emissions reductions, on a per vehicle
basis, in such areas, taking into consideration the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emission
control, and economic factors.'' The Act also allows EPA to impose an RVP standard lower than 9.0 psi in any former ozone
nonattainment area which is redesignated as being in attainment.

On May 29, 1991, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which modified the Phase II summer ozone volatility
standards to reflect new section 211(h) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this notice, EPA proposed that, beginning in 1992, the RVP standard would be 9.0 psi in all attainment areas where
this standard was not already in place. The effect of this proposal was to prohibit the sale of gasoline with a Reid Vapor
Pressure above 9.0 psi during the summer ozone season in all areas designated attainment for ozone for 1992 and beyond.
For areas that had been designated as nonattainment, EPA proposed that the original Phase II standards published
on June 11, 1990 not be changed. On December 12, 1991 EPA finalized these modifications.

The Denver-Boulder metropolitan area is designated nonattainment for the ozone NAAQS. The nonattainment area which
encompasses Denver's entire six-county Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, with the exception of Rocky
Mountain National Park in Boulder County and the eastern portions of Adams and Arapahoe Counties. Under the Phase
II rule finalized on December 12, 1991, the standard applicable in the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area beginning
in 1992 was determined to be 9.0 psi in May and 7.8 psi from June 1 to September 15. The standard applicable in other areas
of Colorado was established at 9.0 psi from May 1 to September 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On November 6, 1991, EPA issued its ozone nonattainment designations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to section 107(d)(1)(C) of the Act, as amended. In the November 6, 1991 notice, EPA designated the Denver-Boulder
nonattainment area to be a ``transitional area'' as determined under section 185A of the Act, as amended. A transitional
area is ``an area designated as an ozone nonattainment area as of the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (that) has not violated the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone for the 36-month period
commencing on January 1, 1987, and ending on December 31, 1989.''

 EPA will rely on states to initiate changes to the EPA volatility program that they believe will enhance local air quality
and/or increase the economic efficiency of the program, within the statutory limits. EPA provided a mechanism for
the Governor of a state to request a less stringent volatility standard for some month or months, if the petition could
demonstrate the existence of a particular local economic impact that made such changes appropriate and if the petition
could demonstrate that sufficient alternative programs were available to achieve attainment and maintenance of
the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

II. EPA's Approval of Colorado's Petition for 1992 and 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 16, 1991, Governor Roy Romer requested EPA to amend the federal RVP standards for the Denver-Boulder ozone
nonattainment area. The specific change requested was to relax the 7.8 psi standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment
area to 9.0 psi area for 1992 and 1993. The Governor further requested that the 7.8 psi standard take effect beginning
in June of 1994, unless the State of Colorado specifically requested via the Colorado Ozone Maintenance State Implementation
Plan (SIP), that the 9.0 psi standard be retained. EPA thus treated this petition as a request for a two-year relaxation
of the volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area to 9.0 psi until 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 12, 1992, EPA proposed to approve the State of Colorado's petition to relax until 1994 the gasoline volatility
standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area. EPA reviewed the State of Colorado's petition and found that
the request to relax the federal volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area until 1994 from the
Phase II standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi was justified based on the petition itself, the evidence submitted on behalf
of Governor Romer, and EPA's own analysis of the costs of implementation of the 7.8 psi standard and the environmental
need for the 7.8 psi standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition and available evidence sufficiently demonstrated that retention of the 7.8 psi standard would impose
significant costs on consumers and industry relative to a 9.0 psi standard, and that the 7.8 psi standard was not necessary
for emission control until 1994 in light of the current transitional status of the Denver-Boulder area. EPA also determined
that an analysis by Colorado to demonstrate that sufficient alternative programs were in place to insure future attainment
of the ozone standard was not necessary due to the State's consistent attainment of the ozone NAAQS since 1986. Finally,
Colorado provided further assurances that a two-year relaxation of the standard would provide sufficient time for
the State to complete an ozone maintenance plan. Such a plan would allow the State to determine if 7.8 psi gasoline was
necessary for continued attainment in future years. Thus, at that time, the State could determine if a permanent change
in the standard was necessary.

Under section 211(h), EPA must set a national summertime gasoline volatility standard of 9.0 psi beginning in 1992.
EPA must also establish more stringent volatility standards ``in a nonattainment area as the Administrator finds
necessary to generally achieve comparable evaporative emissions (on a per-vehicle basis) in nonattainment areas
taking into consideration the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emission control and economic
factors.''

III. Colorado's Petition To Relax the RVP Standard for 1994 and 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 15, 1993, Governor Roy Romer sent a letter to Jack McGraw, Acting Administrator of EPA Region VIII, requesting
that EPA amend the federal RVP standards for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area. Specifically, Governor Romer
requested that EPA extend the relaxation of the RVP standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi granted for the 1992 and 1993 summer
ozone season to the years 1994 and 1995. The Governor further requested that the 7.8 psi standard take effect beginning
in June of 1996, unless the State of Colorado specifically requests via the Colorado Ozone Maintenance SIP that the
9.0 psi standard be retained. EPA thus will treat this petition as a request for a two-year relaxation of the volatility
standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area to 9.0 psi until 1996. If the Governor's request were granted,
the phase II volatility standard of 7.8 psi would not become effective until 1996. Thereafter, the 7.8 psi standard
would be implemented unless EPA receives and approves a subsequent request from the Governor to continue the relaxation
or a maintenance plan is submitted and approved that demonstrates no future need for the 7.8 psi gasoline to achieve
attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governor Romer's request results from the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission's (the Commission) recommendation
to relax the RVP standard. The Commission endorsed the relaxed RVP standard based upon testimony provided at a public
hearing on August 19, 1993, and after consideration of the environmental and economic impact of the 7.8 psi federal
standard. A transcript of the testimony and comments submitted at this hearing are available in the docket for this
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In forwarding this request to EPA, Governor Romer is following procedures stated in the preamble for the Phase II volatility
rule. As mentioned in Section II, requests for changes to the federal volatility standard must include the following:
(1) documentation of the local economic impact of the otherwise applicable standard and (2) an indication that sufficient
alternative programs are available to achieve attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS.

A. The Commission's Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) of the Colorado Department of Health submitted documentation and testimony
to the EPA regarding the environmental need of the 7.8 standard. This testimony was presented at a hearing before the
Colorado Air Quality Control Commission held on August 19, 1993. The APCD testified in support of a relaxation of the
RVP standard to 9.0 psi before the Commission, stating that the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area had not violated
the NAAQS for ozone for the period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989 when EPA designated areas under the Act.
Because Denver had not experienced ozone violations during this time period, the Denver-Boulder area was afforded
``transitional'' nonattainment status. The APCD further testified that there were no monitored violations of the
ozone NAAQS since 1986. The APCD noted that the volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area in
1992 and 1993 was 9.0 psi and no violations of the standard were recorded. (However, there were single exceedances
of the ozone NAAQS at two stations during 1993.) The APCD concluded that the Denver-Boulder area would be able to continue
attainment of the ozone standard with 9.0 psi RVP gasoline based upon this information. The APCD also concluded that
implementation of the lower RVP standard would burden refiners, gasoline marketers, and consumers unnecessarily
with higher costs especially in light of current ozone concentration levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petition that Colorado sent to EPA in 1991 requesting relaxation of the RVP standard in the Denver-Boulder
area during 1992 and 1993, the APCD was to have completed an ozone maintenance plan for the Denver area by June of 1993.
The maintenance plan is necessary in order for the EPA to redesignate the area as having attained the ozone standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the August 19, 1993 hearing, the Commission raised questions regarding the inability of the APCD to complete the
ozone maintenance plan on time. The APCD testified that due to resource limitations caused by programmatic obligations
under the Act, an ozone maintenance plan assumed a lower priority and could not be completed by the June 1993 deadline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the APCD concluded that a two year extension of the RVP relaxation would be necessary to provide sufficient time
to develop the ozone maintenance plan. Furthermore, because the Denver area continued to attain the ozone standard,
the APCD concluded that an extension of the relaxation was not inappropriate. The APCD estimated that a plan would
be developed and submitted by early 1995. It therefore recommended that a petition to relax the 7.8 psi standard to
9.0 be approved by the Commission and subsequently recommended to the Governor.

In particular, the APCD testified that the considerable amount of work that had to be devoted to the PM 10 and CO nonattainment
SIPs, made it impossible to complete work on the ozone SIP. The Denver-Boulder area is a moderate nonattainment area
for both PM10 and CO.

Based on the information received in the hearing, the Commission on August 19, 1993 adopted a resolution requesting
that Governor Romer petition the EPA to retain the 9.0 psi standard for the 1994 and 1995 summer ozone seasons. The Commission
also adopted a declaration that the APCD begin work on the Ozone Maintenance SIP and that it be completed on time. Governor
Romer subsequently requested the two year relaxation in a letter dated September 15, 1993 to Acting Regional Administrator
Jack McGraw.

B. Sufficient Alternative Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because Colorado has not violated the ozone standard since 1986, EPA does not believe it is necessary for the State
to show that sufficient alternative programs are in place to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS. EPA approved
the Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Denver-Boulder area in 1983.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This plan relied upon emission reductions from the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program and an Inspection and Maintenance
Program to provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the statutory deadline of December 31, 1987. Since the beginning
of 1986, none of the area's several ozone air quality monitors has recorded a violation of the ozone NAAQS.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the available data showed no violations, EPA did not require the State to submit a revised Ozone SIP in 1988
during EPA's nationwide ozone SIP evaluation. As noted above, the area is currently classified as a ``Transitional''
area under section 185(A) of the Act. Under these circumstances, Colorado need not provide for alternative ozone
control programs in order to obtain a relaxation of the RVP standard to 9.0 psi.

A. Relaxation of Colorado's Reid Vapor Pressure Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving as a direct final decision the State of Colorado's request to relax the federal volatility standard
for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area until 1996 from the current standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. Section 211(h)
of the Act requires EPA to promulgate regulations that shall establish RVP standards in a nonattainment area that
are more stringent than 9.0 psi ``as the Administrator finds necessary to generally achieve comparable evaporative
emissions (on a per-vehicle basis) in nonattainment areas taking into consideration the enforceability of such
standards, the need of an area for emission control, and economic factors.'' Based on the petition and the evidence
submitted on behalf of Governor Romer, EPA believes that the requested relaxation of the standard is justified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition and available evidence indicated that retention of the 7.8 psi standard would impose significant cost
on consumers and industry and that the 7.8 psi standard is not necessary in the short-term given the current transitional
status of the Denver-Boulder area and the area's record of continued attainment of the ozone standard. Although Colorado
has not submitted additional analysis regarding the costs of implementing a 7.8 psi RVP standard, EPA believes the
cost analysis it performed based on Colorado's original 1991 petition is still applicable. That analysis indicated
that a $3,500,000 to $4,000,000 savings would be realized in the Denver-Boulder area during the summer ozone season.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed in the May 29, 1991 notice EPA estimates that a relaxation of the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 psi will result
in a savings of approximately 1.1 cents per gallon.

Moreover, EPA agrees with Colorado that the Denver-Boulder area will not need a 7.8 psi standard in the next two years
to comply with the ozone NAAQS. The area has not violated the standard since 1986. Since this time summertime gasoline
volatility was reduced significantly through the implementation of the Phase I and Phase II of the federal RVP standards.
Although EPA believes that a short term relaxation of the RVP standard will not cause a violation of the ozone NAAQS
in the Denver-Boulder area, EPA is concerned regarding the area's long term compliance. The Denver-Boulder area's
growing population and increase in vehicle miles travelled generate questions regarding whether sufficient controls
are available to provide for maintenance of the ozone NAAQS over the long term. Moreover, the area did experience single
exceedances during the 1993 ozone season at two monitoring stations and has experienced other readings near or above
0.120 in recent years. Therefore, the long-term maintenance of the standard in the Denver-Boulder areas is in question.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, Colorado has failed to develop a maintenance plan for the Denver-Boulder area, despite its commitment
to do so by June, 1993 in the original request for relaxation of the RVP standard in Denver-Boulder during 1992 and 1993.
EPA granted Colorado's original request for relaxation with the expectation that the state would submit an ozone
maintenance plan by this date. Colorado's failure has left EPA with no assurance that the Denver-Boulder area will
be able to maintain its compliance with the ozone NAAQS for the next ten years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the area's classification as transitional, EPA was required to determine by June 30, 1992 whether the area
had in fact attained the ozone standard by December 31, 1991. If the Administrator determined that the area had attained
the standard, the state was required to submit, within twelve months of the determination, a maintenance plan meeting
the requirements of section 175A of the Act.

 Thomas Getz, Director of the APCD has submitted a letter to EPA that asserts that the ozone maintenance plan has been
delayed because of serious staff resource constraints caused by projects of higher priority, including the PM 10
and CO SIPs. The letter states that the PM 10 and CO SIPs are subject to potential sanctions and that the state has been
working to address the statutorily mandated deadlines for these plans. As the Denver-Boulder area has not experienced
an ozone violation in recent years, the APCD believed the completion of the ozone SIP to be less urgent than the completion
of the other plans. In addition, data necessary to complete baseline emissions inventories was not available for
use in the plan. This memo has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking.

On October 22, 1992, EPA Region VIII sent a letter to Governor Romer stating that the Denver-Boulder transitional
area had not violated the ozone NAAQS during the period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite these limitations, however, Colorado has committed to developing a maintenance plan for ozone to be submitted
by early 1995. Through this plan, the state will determine what additional control measures, if any, will be necessary
to provide for continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The maintenance plan must show that the ozone standard will
be maintained for a period of at least ten years. The development of this maintenance plan will give Colorado an opportunity
to conduct a comprehensive air quality modeling exercise to determine what control measures will be necessary to
provide for long term maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Along with the existing SIP measures, tighter gasoline volatility
and other strategies will be evaluated to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective strategy for maintaining
the NAAQS. Today's action should provide Colorado with sufficient time to complete an ozone maintenance plan. Moreover,
ongoing vehicle fleet turnover, as well as several new requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments (such as tighter
tailpipe standards, longer useful life definitions, on-board diagnostic and refueling equipment, and enhanced
inspection and maintenance requirements) are likely to lead to reduction in overall mobile source emissions of VOCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the maintenance plan is being developed, EPA believes that air quality will be protected by the ongoing control
programs. The volatility standard for Denver-Boulder will drop to 7.8 psi in 1996 unless additional action by the
Commission and the Governor, backed by a comprehensive maintenance plan, is taken to extend the 9.0 psi standard.

B. Direct Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this relaxation in the RVP regulation
is noncontroversial; the effect of this rulemaking is limited to the Denver-Boulder, Colorado nonattainment area;
and EPA anticipates no significant comments on this action. This action represents a continuation of a previously
approved relaxation in the RVP standard and will provide Colorado the necessary time to complete an ozone maintenance
plan at which time a long term projection will be made regarding the need for a more stringent RVP standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, unless notice is received within 30 days of today's notice that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical
comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published.
One notice, which will be published before the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another notice will
begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons
are invited to submit comments on this proposed approval. EPA will consider all comments received within thirty days
of the publication of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, this procedure still allows the opportunity for public comment and opportunity for oral presentation
of data that is required under CAA section 307(d). This procedure merely provides an expedited procedure for final
action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial and no adverse comment is expected.

V. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment is not expected to have any adverse environmental effects. The Denver-Boulder six county
nonattainment area has met the NAAQS since 1986. Current air quality is expected to be further maintained by a 9.0 psi
standard.

VI. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed relaxation of the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 psi will result in a cost reduction in refining, and an increase
in summertime gasoline supply levels. For each summer, this translates into approximately a 1.1 cent per gallon cost
savings to consumers at the pump.

VII. Administrative Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory
flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations
and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. In such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not
required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I certify that these regulations will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulatory revision is limited to the Denver-Boulder area and
should have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These regulations, therefore,
do not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Specifically, this rule will not have an annual effect on the economy
in excess of $100 million, have a significant adverse impact on competition, investment, employment or innovation,
or result in a major price increase. In fact, as discussed above, this action will reduce the cost of compliance with
Federal requirements in this area.

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, EPA must obtain OMB clearance for any activity that will

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions contained in rules promulgated
between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster II. These requirements are listed in Section
B of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made
a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the North Carolina hazardous waste program revisions satisfy
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North Carolina's
hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's application for program revisions is available for public
review and comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows
States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated
under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements
under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. North Carolina 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984,
(49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final authorization effective March 28, 1994, for RCRA I (59
FR 3791, January 27, 1994). On September 27, 1993, North Carolina submitted a program revision application for additional
program approvals. Today, North Carolina is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Carolina. The public
may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 4, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of North Carolina's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the
locations indicated in the Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective June 3, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice
containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon
the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior
to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions
for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Carolina is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements promulgated between
July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, for the requirements of RCRA Cluster II. This would include all rules except for the
Technical Amendments and Administrative Stay for the Boilers and Industrial Furnaces rule noted at the end of this
section.

North Carolina is not authorized for the February 21, 1991, (56 FR 7134), Boilers and Industrial Furnaces Rule, (BIF).
Therefore, authorization for the Technical Amendments and the Administrative Stay for BIF promulgated July 17,
1991, (56 FR 32688) Checklist 94; August 27, 1991, (56 FR 42504) Checklist 96; and September 5, 1991, (56 FR 43874) Checklist
98, will be deferred until the State is granted authorization for the Boilers and Industrial Furnace Rule.

C. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that North Carolina's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory
requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous
waste program as revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application,
and its previously approved authorities. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although
EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under section
3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Maritime Commission, by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') published February 11, 1994; 59 FR 6610,
proposed amendments to its regulations implementing the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The Commission previously had
exempted certain systems of records containing investigatory materials from the provisions of subsections (c)(3)
and (d) of the Act which require an accounting of disclosures and permit access to records in the systems. The NPR proposed
additional exemptions under subsections (k)(2) and (5) of the Act for various systems of records within the agency.
These exemptions would apply to those systems of records which include investigatory material compiled either for
law enforcment purposes or, to the extent disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source, for the purpose
of determining suitability for Federal civilian employment or for access to classified information. An additional
exemption under subsection (j)(2) of the Act was proposed for the ``Inspector General File'' system of records in
regards to activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The thrust of the NPR was to invoke the full reach
of permitted exemptions so that the provisions of certain subsections of the Act would not routinely limit the sources
from which information is obtained and the types of information permitted to be collected, or require procedures
for notification of the existence of and access to these classes of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were filed in response to the NPR and the Commission has determined to adopt the amendments proposed therein
as final. The new exemptions pertaining to law enforcement records are appropriate to avoid compromise of ongoing
investigations, disclosure of the identity of confidential sources, and invasion of personal privacy of third parties.
The exemptions pertaining to personnel-related investigatory records will protect confidential sources.

The Chairman of the Commission certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,
including small businesses, small organizational units or small governmental organizations because individuals
affected by the rule do not appear to fall within the meaning of ``small entity.''

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is in response to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishing a final revised OMB Circular
A&hyph;110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,
Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 62992) on November 29, 1993. The revised Circular was developed by an interagency task force for governmentwide
use in a common rule format to facilitate regulatory adoption by executive departments and agencies. In the published
revised Circular, OMB specified as ``required action'' that, Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering
grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language in the Circular unless other
provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. This interim final rule
essentially adopts the provisions of the Circular word-for-word to the maximum extent possible but documents statutory
deviations. Except for controls over deviations to the rule, the Department of Transportation (DOT) operating administrations
and departmental offices that make awards are responsible for all sections of the rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule incorporates and reflects the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issuance
of revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 at 58 FR 62992 into a new 49 CFR part 19 of the DOT regulatory requirements for financial
assistance. OMB Circular A&hyph;110 was originally issued by OMB in 1976 with minor revision made in 1987. The standards
it contained were structured into 15 attachments lettered A-O. An interagency task force also reviewed the circular
in 1987 and recommended it be combined with OMB Circular A&hyph;102, Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements
with State and Local Governments, as a consolidated ``common rule''. In November 1988, a proposed consolidated ``common
rule'' was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 44716) but, due to adverse concerns by some university groups and Federal agencies it was not finalized and issued
by OMB. In November 1990, another interagency task force was convened to review Circular A&hyph;110 and a revision
in a ``common rule'' format was proposed and developed. This revision was published for comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 39018) in August 1992 and over 200 comments were received from all sources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All comments were considered in a final revision of Circular A&hyph;110 which was issued for governmentwide use in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 29, 1993. Consequently, this rule is published as an interim final rule because of the previous request
for comment process used in the development of the Circular, the large number of comments already received and considered
by OMB and the Federal agencies, and due to the limited flexibility to revise the rule provided by OMB.

Deviations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain specific statutes governing the Department take precedence over some requirements of the revised OMB Circular
A&hyph;110. All deviations have been written in a standard format to provide both the basis for the exception and information
on where the exception has been implemented in DOT guidance. A summary of proposed deviations appears below. Where
nonregulatory guidance is cited as the implementing instruction, it does not supersede regulatory requirements
nor is it intended to request formal comments on the specific procedures nor provide regulatory clearance for the
guidance. Some DOT operating administrations have developed nonregulatory guidance for administering financial
assistance awards to recipients. Section 19.6, Availability of material reference in this part, has been added to
Subpart A_General to reference where copies of these directives may be found and obtained. Each DOT deviation is discussed
below. In addition, the revised OMB Circular affects the management of subgrants in two FTA programs run by States
and this is discussed below.

Deviations Based on Statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection 23(i) is added to 19.23, Cost-sharing or matching, to clarify that local share for Section 18 operating
assistance must be derived from sources other than Federal funds or revenues of the system; and up to half of the local
share may be derived from other Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 24(i) is added to 19.24, Program income, to clarify the special requirements for determining program
income for FTA section 16(b)(2) and section 18 grant programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 30(b) is added to 19.30, Purpose of property standards, to clarify that real property (including land)
and equipment acquired under the Act can be transferred without compensation to another organization for another
public purpose under certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 44(f) is added to 19.44, Procurement procedures, to note the additional procurement requirements imposed
on certain programs in the areas of Buy American, contracting for architectural and engineering services, exclusionary
or discriminatory specifications, and cargo preference.

Nonstatutory Deviations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 19.5, Subgrants. The March 11, 1988, common rule for grants to State and local governments clearly provides
for States to use their own procedures for managing subgrants to governmental subrecipients, but is silent on the
treatment of nongovernmental subrecipients. The Department had interpreted the rule to allow States to use State
procedures for all types of subrecipients. The November 1988, notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would have
merged the common rule for State and local governments with the requirements for institutions of higher education,
hospitals, and other non-profit organizations would have allowed States to use their own procedures for managing
subgrants to all types of recipients. Revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 clearly does not provide this flexibility
to States. The FTA section 18 and section 16(b)(2) programs provide grants to States which have local government and
nonprofit subrecipients which perform similar functions. Prohibiting States from using State procedures could
complicate the State administration of the programs. However, the increased flexibility provided in the rule should
eliminate most of the issues that have caused problems for the States in the past. The Department does not have sufficient
detailed information to support a deviation request from OMB that would allow States to continue to use their own procedures
to manage subgrants to nongovernmental subrecipients for FTA section 18 and section 16(b)(2) programs. If after
reviewing this rule, grantees can provide detailed examples of how the new requirement will complicate the grant
process without a subsequent gain in control, the Department will consider requesting a class deviation from OMB
as provided in &sect;19.4, Deviations.

The Department of Transportation has determined that this rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action within
the meaning of Executive Order 12866, nor a significant regulation under the Department's Regulatory Policies and
Procedures. The regulations should create savings for recipients by reducing the costs of administering grants.
Because of this, the Department certifies that this regulation is nonsignificant under the Department of Transportation's
Regulatory Policies and Procedures.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that, for each rule with a ``significant economic impact
on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a substantial number of small entities,'' an analysis be prepared describing the rule's impact on small entities
and identifying any significant alternatives to the rule that would minimize the economic impact on small entities.
We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they do not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but rather modify and update administrative
and procedural requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
The rule primarily applies to organizations other than State and local governments, but for some programs State or
local governments are required to pass on these requirements to subrecipients covered by this rule. The rule was drafted
to be as consistent as possible with requirements imposed on State and local governments. Accordingly, the Department
certifies that this proposal does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant a full Federalism Assessment
under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.

Justification to Issue Interim Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Administrative Procedures Act, to issue a final rule without an NPRM, it is necessary to make a finding that
issuing an NPRM would be impractical, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. As stated above, this rule
is based on the revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110, that was developed by an interagency task force and received extensive
public comment. The revised Circular specifies that Federal agencies responsible for awarding and administering
grants and other agreements to recipients described therein, shall adopt the language in the Circular unless other
provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. This interim final rule
essentially adopts the provisions of the Circular word-for-word to the maximum extent possible. Therefore, an NPRM
would not allow the public to make comments that could have a significant impact on the content of the rule. This would
make such an effort impractical, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements
of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions
from the requirements of this part shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding agencies may
apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. All requests for class deviations
shall be processed through the Assistant Secretary for Administration. Federal awarding agencies may apply less
restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory, subject
to the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Administration. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be
made by Federal awarding agencies, with the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Administration to ensure

Use of grants and cooperative agreements, and contracts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative
agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301&hyph;08) governs the use
of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal
purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.
The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial
involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying
out the activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition
of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205), declares that
the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of
E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.''

purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education,
hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference
in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal
awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements
of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

 (b) (1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in
section &sect;19.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal
awarding agency to the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic
fund transfers are not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal
awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding
agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project
is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor
portion of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt
of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

are not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that
reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency
may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's
disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements.
The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely
advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges
made by recipients at any time during the project period unless the conditions in paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this section
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable
notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until
the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require
separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories
for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless the conditions in paragraphs
(k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. In keeping with Electric Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR part 206), interest should be
remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electric medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients
which do not have this capability should use a check. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it
pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards
without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under
CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF&hyph;270
as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods
are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in
lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding
agency shall adopt the SF&hyph;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction
programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF&hyph;270 when the Federal awarding agency determines
that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities
acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the
lesser of (1) or (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency
may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value
at the time of donation to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if the conditions in paragraph (g)(1) or (2)
of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved
the charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.

(iii) Section 18(e) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended, (49 U.S.C. app. 1614(e)) provides that the Federal share
for operating assistance shall not exceed 50 percent of the net cost. At least 50 percent of the remainder (the local
share) must be derived from sources other than Federal funds or revenues of the system; and up to half of the local share
may be derived from other Federal funds. For purposes of determining local share for section 18 operating assistance,
the term ``Federal funds or revenues'' does not include funds received pursuant to a service agreement with a State
or local service agency or a private social service organization. Nonregulatory guidance is contained in FTA Circular
9040.1B, section 18 Program Guidance and Grant Application Instructions, Chapter III, section 7.

Program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations
to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained
by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award,
shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible
project or program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal
share of costs is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of
the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects
or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically
unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient
is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in &sect;19.14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident
to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these
costs have not been charged to the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards
(See &sect;&sect;19.30 through 19.37). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients
shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties
for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However,
Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or
research award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 4(a) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended, (49 U.S.C. app. 1603(a)) allows FTA recipients to retain program
income for allowable capital or operating expenses, but program income may not be used to refund or reduce the local
share of a grant. The section 16 and 18 programs, however, operate differently. Under the special authority to set
appropriate terms and conditions for the section 16(b)(2) program, program income in the form of contract service
revenue may be used as local share without a proportionate reduction in the Federal share. Similarly, section 18 allows
the use of program income in the form of contract service revenue as local share without requiring a proportionate
reduction in the Federal share. Grantees must account for program income in their accounting systems, which are subject
to audit. The accounting system must be capable of identifying program income and the purpose for which it was used.
Nonregulatory guidance is contained in FTA notice N 5.5005.1, Guidance on Program Income and Sales Proceeds.

(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are
authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this
part and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or
more of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the
Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency
is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award
is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with
the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.
This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the
agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically
waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph
(e)(2) of this section applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or
programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative
amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal
awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or
part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section,
do not require prior approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies
for budget revisions whenever the conditions in paragraphs (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed
consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in &sect;19.27. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction
work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency
before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify
the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed
the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5,000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever
is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation
award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application
unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies
shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision
is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient
in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with
the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.

(a) Sections 19.31 through 19.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished
by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding agencies
shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements,
unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and
procedures provided it observes the provisions of &sect;&sect;19.31 through 19.37. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transfer of capital assets. Section 12(k) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended, (49 U.S.C. app. 1608(k)) allows
the transfer without compensation of real property (including land) and equipment acquired under the Act for another
public purpose under certain conditions. Procedures to allow these transfers have not been issued.

Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of
real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements,
at a minimum, shall contain the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Federal awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other
federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose
of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e.,
awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Department of Transportation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The
Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and
pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the
Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any,
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures
shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion
of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding
agency for further Federal agency utilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to
the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the
property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C.
3710(I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821,
``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions
shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to
property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under
conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal
awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall
be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal
Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by
the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal
awarding agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency
or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation
in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has
no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency.
The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements.
If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services
Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other
Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar
days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying
to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However,
the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever
is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the
Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party
named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer
shall be subject to the following standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of
a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment.
If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient

inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project
or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate

Sections 19.41 through 19.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by
Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency,
regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source
evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to
such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid
or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest
to do so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by 49 CFR part 29, the implementation of
E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement
documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the
following conditions apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements
of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest
is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status
of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of
not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272,
Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that
a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used
only for advances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal
awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the
accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual
information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or
program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not
be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the
completion of the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original
and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and
semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved
by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF&hyph;272
and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to
monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of
the report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks''
section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients
receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following
reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive
Federal advances; or, (C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall
be observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall
issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in
&sect;19.21, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to
the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this
information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format
or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes
to the accuracy of reporting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement
is not applicable to the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph &sect;19.53(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines
that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal
awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint
use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers,
or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public
access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate
that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply
to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: Indirect cost rate computations or proposals,
cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If submitted for negotiation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal,
plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting
records starts on the date of such submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If not submitted for negotiation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit
to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period
for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

Termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if the conditions in paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon
the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to
be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for
such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However,
if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion
of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety
under either paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in &sect;19.71(a), including
those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall
be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

Enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award,
whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding
agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in &sect;19.14, take one or more of the following
actions, as appropriate in the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by the Federal awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity
for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation
applicable to the action involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient
during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes
them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after
termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if the conditions in paragraph (c) (1)
or (2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension
and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and
12689 and 49 CFR part 29 (see &sect;19.13).

 The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (AA), NMFS, announces that Ecuador, Spain and Vanuatu have submitted
acceptable documentation to indicate that they continue to be in compliance with the yellowfin tuna importation
regulations for nations that harvest yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). NMFS announces
that it has made the affirmative findings and findings of conformance for these nations thus allowing the importation
of yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from these nations to continue through December 31, 1994.

The AA also announces that Spain has submitted acceptable documentation that it has not imported, during the preceding
6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products prohibited from direct export to the United States. NMFS announces
that it has made such affirmative finding. This finding, in conjunction with renewal of the affirmative finding for
Spain as a harvesting nation, allows the importation of yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna into
the United States from Spain through December 31, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 18, 1992, NMFS published a final rule (57 FR 54334) that established a provision for timely consideration
and making of an affirmative finding under the yellowfin tuna import regulations for nations that prohibit their
vessels from intentionally setting on marine mammals in the course of harvesting yellowfin tuna by purse seine in
the ETP. With an affirmative finding, yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from a harvesting nation can be imported
into the United States. The regulations, found at 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5) (viii) through (x), require that the AA announce
and publish the finding in the

On December 16, 1993, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that the Republic of Ecuador had
provided documentary evidence establishing that its regulatory program continues to comply with the yellowfin
tuna importation provisions of 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5) (viii) through (x). As a result of this affirmative finding, yellowfin
tuna and products from yellowfin tuna harvested by Ecuadorian-flag purse seine vessels operating in the ETP, may
be imported into the United States through December 31, 1994.

On December 23, 1993, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that Spain had submitted documentary
evidence establishing that its regulatory program continues to comply with the tuna importation provisions of 50
CFR 216.24(e)(5) (viii) through (x). However, a secondary embargo on yellowfin tuna from Spain as an intermediary
nation had been in effect since January 31, 1991. Yellowfin tuna harvested by Spanish-flag purse seine vessels could
not be imported into the United States until the secondary embargo on all yellowfin tuna from Spain as an intermediary
nation had been lifted.

On December 3, 1993, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that Spain had submitted acceptable
documentary evidence that it had not imported in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products
prohibited from direct export to the United States. As a result of this finding, the secondary embargo on Spain as an
intermediary nation was lifted, and yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP
by Spanish-flag vessels can be imported into the United States through December 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The yellowfin tuna import regulations at 50 CFR 216.24.(e)(5) also establish provisions for timely consideration
and making of an affirmative finding for nations whose vessels harvest yellowfin tuna in the ETP by intentionally
setting on marine mammals. These regulations require that the government of the harvesting nation adopt a regulatory
program governing the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of such harvesting that is comparable to the
regulatory program of the United States; and that the average rate of incidental mortality by vessels of the harvesting
nation is comparable to the average rate of incidental mortality of marine mammals by U.S. vessels in the course of
such harvesting. An affirmative finding under these regulations allows importation into the United States of yellowfin
tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels greater than 400 short tons
carrying capacity through December 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The AA reviewed the annual report submitted by the Republic of Vanuatu as required by 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(iv), describing
the activities of the Vanuatu-flag purse seine fleet during the 1993 fishing year (October 1, 1992, through September
30, 1993). The review resulted in a determination that the average rate of incidental taking by Vanuatu-flag vessels
was 0.80 times that of the U.S. fleet during the same period (no more than 1.25 times that of U.S. vessels is permitted),
and that the percentage of the total mortality for eastern spinner dolphin and coastal spotted dolphin is 6.50 and
6.15 percent, respectively. (Percentages of no greater than 15.0 and 2.0 percent of the total mortality are required.)
Based on these data, a negative finding was indicated because the number of incidental coastal spotted dolphin mortalities
exceeded 2.0 percent of the total mortality, and NMFS was prepared to make such a finding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, Vanuatu authorized the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) to provide observer data to NMFS
for the 12-month period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, for reconsideration by the AA. These data provided
the information required by 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(vii). Submission of the most recent 12 months of data is described
by &sect;216.24(e)(5)(vii)(A), for reconsideration of a negative finding if the species composition rate was not
acceptable for the fishing year. The data provided for the December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, period indicated
that the mortality for eastern spinner and coastal spotted dolphin comprised 4.08 and 0.54 percent of the total mortality,
respectively. An affirmative finding for Vanuatu was indicated based on these data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall, rather than a weighted, incidental kill-per-set (kps) factor for Vanuatu was used to determine comparability
for both periods because the U.S. fleet had fewer than five sets in Fishing Area 3 on common dolphins, an area and species
grouping in which the Vanuatu fleet made sets (50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(v)(F)). Observers assigned by the IATTC accompanied
all fishing trips made by Vanuatu-flag purse seine vessels in the ETP during the 1993 fishing season and during the
12-month period submitted for reconsideration, as required by the Notice of Determination published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 8, 1992 (57 FR 668). A complete list of Vanuatu-flag tuna purse seine vessels over 400 short tons carrying
capacity and their status during the two periods has been submitted, as required by &sect;216.24(e)(5)(ii)(B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the information described above, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found
that the average rate of incidental taking of marine mammals by Vanuatu-flag vessels was comparable to that of U.S.-flag
vessels, and Vanuatu's regulatory program governing the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of harvesting
yellowfin tuna by purse seine in the ETP was comparable to the regulatory program of the United States, as required
by the tuna importation provisions of 50 CFR 216.24(e). As a result of this affirmative finding, yellowfin tuna and
products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested by Vanuatu-flag purse seine vessels operating in the ETP may be imported
into the United States through December 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, primary embargoes banning the importation of yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna
harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama remain in effect. In addition,
intermediary nation embargoes banning the importation of all yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from Costa
Rica, Italy, and Japan remain in effect. Questions regarding these primary and secondary embargoes should be directed
to the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (See

 An emergency interim rule in effect through April 2, 1994, to protect overfished stocks of haddock is extended from

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 3, 1994, through June 30, 1994, because conditions warranting the emergency still exist. The Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) extends the 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit of haddock for all vessels permitted under the regulations
governing the Northeast Multispecies Fishery and for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ), except for scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock;
and the closure of the area known as Closed Area II. Extension of other measures contained in the emergency rule is not
necessary, since these were permanently implemented on March 1, 1994, under Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies
Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The intended effect of this rule is to provide protection to depleted haddock and cod
stocks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), the Secretary promulgated
an emergency interim rule (59 FR 26, January 3, 1994) that implemented cod and haddock protective measures for the
Northeast multispecies fishery for the period January 3, 1994, through April 2, 1994. The emergency interim rule
implemented: (1) A 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit of haddock for all vessels permitted under 50 CFR 651.4 and
for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the EEZ, except scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from
possessing or landing haddock; (2) an early closure of the area known as Closed Area II, except for lobster pot vessels
and scallop dredge vessels; (3) an expansion of Closed Area II by 20 minutes longitude to the west and 15 minutes latitude
to the south, along its existing western and southern boundaries, intersecting with the Regulated Mesh Boundary
line; (4) a suspension of the closure of the area known as Closed Area I, except for vessels using sink gillnet gear;
(5) a prohibition on transfer of fish at sea; and (6) a ban on pair trawling in the multispecies fishery. With the agreement
of the New England Fishery Management Council, the Secretary extends the emergency interim rule under provisions
of section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson Act because conditions warranting this emergency still exist. The 500-lb
(226.8-kg) haddock possession limit, except for scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or
landing haddock, and the closure of Closed Area II, are extended from April 3, 1994, through

March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872), five of the measures contained in the emergency interim rule published January 3, 1994 (59
FR 26), were permanently added to 50 CFR part 651, and are therefore not included in this extension. These measures
are: (1) The expansion of Closed Area II; (2) the closure of Area II from February through May in 1994 and 1995, and from
January through June in 1996 and after; (3) the suspension of the closure of the area known as Closed Area I, except for
vessels using sink gillnet gear; (4) a prohibition on transfer of fish at sea; and (5) a ban on pair trawling in the multispecies
fishery.

 NMFS issues this final rule to delay for 30 days the effective date for implementation of the 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum
mesh size requirement for the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank (GOM/GB) regulated mesh area and the Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys
Ledge (SB/JL) juvenile protection area as established under Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast
Multispecies Fishery (FMP) and its implementing regulations. Participants fishing in these areas in this fishery
may continue to fish with 51/2-inch (13.97-cm) mesh through April 30, 1994. The minimum mesh-size requirement for
the GOM/GB and SB/JL areas will become 6 inches (15.24 cm) beginning May 1, 1994. The intent of this delay in effective
date is to allow additional time for fishermen to obtain nets with the required mesh size which are presently in short
supply in the fishery.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 5 to the FMP was prepared by the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of
the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act) and approved by NMFS. Regulations implementing Amendment 5 were published March 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(59 FR 9872), and corrected on March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10588). In addition to other management measures, the regulations
implemented a 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh size requirement in the GOM/GB regulated mesh area and the SB/JL juvenile
protection area effective April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fishing industry has reported that local New England mesh suppliers do not have adequate supplies of 6-inch (15.24-cm)
mesh available. In order to allow time for adequate supply quantities to become available and for all in the fishery
to procure conforming nets, this rule delays the effective date of the 6-inch (15.24-cm) mesh requirement for 30 days.
Beginning May 1, 1994, all multispecies permit holders must comply with the 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh-size
requirement in the GOM/GB and SB/JL areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) has determined that this delay in effective date is necessary
to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes a permanent change in the regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;651.20(a)(2) and (a)(5) to incorporate language specifying that the 6-inch (15.24-cm) minimum mesh-size
requirement is not effective until May 1, 1994, under the emergency authority of section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson
Act. Although section 305(c)(3)(B) stipulates that emergency regulations may not remain in effect for more than
two 90-day periods after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the permanent change in the regulatory language which is needed for clarity and for the convenience of the public,
will have regulatory effect on the public only from April 1 through April 30, 1994, which is well within the limitation
on emergency rule effectiveness of the Magnuson Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons (``Bureau'') is amending its rule on Telephone Regulations in order to provide
for the operation of the Inmate Telephone System (``ITS'') and to clarify references to loss of telephone privileges
under institutional disciplinary sanctions. This document also amends the Bureau's rule on the Inmate Financial
Responsibility Program as it relates to telephone privileges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments are intended to further the Bureau's core value of sound correctional management both by recognizing
the role of inmate financial responsibility and by further minimizing the security problems and criminal activity
associated with inmate telephone use, thereby improving the safe and secure operation of Bureau institutions. Consistent
with correctional management objectives, these amendments are also intended to reduce generally the costs of telephone
calls by providing for a direct-dial, debit-billing system now available through technological developments in
the telephone and computer industries. This system allows the Bureau to more effectively carry out its long-standing
rule that an inmate is responsible for the expenses of inmate telephone use. These amendments also give the Bureau
more flexibility to efficiently manage inmate telephone use, thus enhancing the Bureau's ability to provide telephone
access to inmates in a manner that facilitates other correctional management goals, such as encouraging inmates
to be financially responsible. Finally, these amendments enable the Bureau to restrict and more effectively monitor
inmate telephone use that may pose a threat to the security of the institution or the public.

Background/History of Inmate Telephone Privileges
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Prisons (``Bureau'') provides inmates with several means of communicating with the public. Primary
among these is written correspondence, with visiting and telephone privileges serving as two supplemental means
of communication. Although there is no Constitutional right for inmates to have unrestricted telephone communication
with members of their families and the community, particularly when there are alternative channels of communication
available, the Bureau provides inmates with telephone access consistent with the requirements of sound correctional
management for the continually expanding inmate population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the early 1970's, telephone privileges in Bureau institutions were determined by local policy, as set by
each Warden. In 1973, the Bureau adopted a national policy to ensure telephone access to all inmates by permitting
every inmate who was not restricted from telephone use to make at least one telephone call every quarter. During the
mid-1970's, telephone privileges routinely consisted of one or two short telephone calls a month on institution
telephones, placed and supervised by staff, and approved in advance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the late 1970's, the Bureau attempted to increase telephone access and reduce staff assistance by the installation
of a collect call system which relied upon inmate use of unattended commercial equipment, tape recording, and operator-assisted
services. This was the system in operation when the Bureau published its final rule on Telephone Regulations June
29, 1979 (44 FR 38249), with a subsequent amendment June 1, 1983 (48 FR 24622).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose of the Amended Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The former regulations, as cited above and as codified in 28 CFR part 540, subpart I, state that the inmate is responsible
for the expenses of inmate telephone use. This has been, and remains, a major tenet of Bureau policy. However, at the
time the former regulations were published, the Bureau had no practicable means of making inmates directly responsible
for the costs of their calls. Hence, those regulations recognized that inmate telephone calls would ordinarily be
made collect to the party called.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technological developments in the telephone and computer industries have now made it possible for the Bureau to install
a debit-billing telephone system which allows the Bureau to more effectively carry out its rule that an inmate is responsible
for the expenses of inmate telephone use. This system, known as the Inmate Telephone System (ITS), is similar to telephone
systems used in many hotels where calls are direct-dialed after being processed through a switch and charged to the
caller's bill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amended telephone regulations provide for the operation of the ITS and permit the Bureau to better address correctional
management and security problems than with the collect call telephone system in place under the former regulations.
These regulations therefore provide an important contribution to the goals of responsible correctional management
in the following ways:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The amended regulations are intended to help teach inmates responsibility and management of resources. The former
collect call system provides little or no incentive for inmates to shoulder personal responsibility for the costs
of their telephone calls, as collect call billing shifts the costs to other parties. This excuses inmates from exercising
a basic form of decision-making on how to spend their funds, a decision that must be made every day by other adults. The
Bureau believes that encouraging inmates to face practical life-style choices is an integral part of the rehabilitation
process. In recognizing the importance of developing this skill, the Bureau provides education programming for
life-coping skills such as budgeting. This is consistent with the Bureau's statutory mandate, as set forth in 18 U.S.C.
4001 and 4042, to provide for inmates' ``government, discipline, treatment, care, rehabilitation, and reformation.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By providing for the operation of a debit-billing system in which inmates are responsible for the cost of their telephone
calls (unless there is good cause for the placement of a collect call or a compelling circumstance justifies the placement
of a call at government expense), the amended regulations help the Bureau to meet its statutory mandate. In order to
exercise their telephone privileges, inmates will have to establish their priorities, purchase telephone credits
at the prison commissary, and manage the expenditure of their telephone credits. Moreover, by taking responsibility
for the costs of their telephone calls and managing their telephone credits, inmates gain an increased sense of control
over their lives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The switch from the former collect system to the debit billing ITS also provides an added incentive for inmates to obtain
the higher-skilled and higher-paying prison work assignments. Through such work, inmates can develop occupational
skills and the discipline of working on a regular basis, factors which contribute to an inmate's successful return
to society. In recognition of this fact, the United States Congress has mandated work assignments for all inmates,
except as necessitated by security considerations, disciplinary action, medical reasons, or other programming
involvement. See 18 U.S.C. 4121; Public Law 101&hyph;647, 104 Stat. 4914. By providing an incentive to work to obtain
money for telephone calls, the amended regulations and the ITS debit-billing system encourage the fulfillment of
this Congressional objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The amended regulations are intended to increase the incentive for inmates to participate in the Inmate Financial
Responsibility Program (IFRP), a program that encourages inmates to set and meet regular payment schedules, consistent
with their resources, for their court-imposed fines, restitutions, and other financial obligations. The program
stresses the importance of fiscal responsibility. See 28 CFR part 545 subpart B. The Bureau considers the inmate's
efforts to fulfill financial obligations as indicative of the inmate's acceptance, and demonstrated level, of responsibility.
This is one factor in determining an inmate's readiness to return to society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation in the IFRP is voluntary, but inmates who refuse to participate are restricted in their commissary
spending, not eligible to receive a furlough or consideration for community placement, and not permitted to work
in Federal Prison Industries. These amended regulations add another restriction to this list: 28 CFR &sect;545.11(d)(10)
provides that inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP are allowed to place no more than one telephone call every
month, at the inmate's expense, absent authorization from the Warden for additional inmate-paid calls based upon
compelling circumstances. Inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP retain the same access as other inmates to
unmonitored attorney calls arranged by unit staff. See re-designated 28 CFR 540.102 and 103, formerly &sect;&sect;540.101
and 102. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau's policy of offering inmates the choice of participating in the IFRP, with its clearly stated consequences,
has been an effective means of helping inmates fulfill their legitimate financial obligations. Since its full implementation
in 1987, through February, 1994, the IFRP has resulted in the collection of approximately $81,000,000.00 toward
payment of inmate fines, debts, and restitution to victims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau notes that the IFRP, by assisting in the collection of fines and legal debts, helps to accomplish not only
a major priority for the Department of Justice, but has also been upheld as serving the valid penological objective
of rehabilitation by facilitating repayment of debts. See

493 U.S. 870). By limiting the telephone privileges of inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP, the Bureau is
providing an additional incentive for inmates to pay their debts to society and is managing telephone privileges
in a manner consistent with other privileges conditioned upon voluntary participation in the IFRP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The amended regulations are designed to contribute to the safety and security of Bureau institutions by providing
more equitable telephone access to the rapidly expanding inmate population. The Bureau of Prisons is faced with an
unprecedented increase in population, leading to a substantial overcrowding of Bureau institutions and a considerable
strain on already limited resources. On February 10, 1994, the Bureau had 82,426 inmates confined in 73 institutions.
These institutions have a total rated capacity of approximately 60,571 inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By explicitly authorizing the Warden to limit the maximum length of inmate telephone calls based on institution conditions,
such as institution population or usage demand, the amended regulations increase the Bureau's ability to manage
this large population by providing greater and more equitable telephone access to inmates. Under the former collect
call system, it is very difficult for staff to enforce any time limits on inmate telephone calls. Some inmates are thus
able to monopolize telephone use, increasing tensions in an overcrowded inmate population. The ITS, in contrast,
can be programmed to terminate a call automatically after the expiration of a certain period of time, ordinarily 15
minutes, so that the telephone will be available for use by another inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is reasonable to expect that debit-billing will affect the ability of some inmates to continue monopolizing
the telephone. By having to pay for their calls directly, these inmates may be unable, or unwilling, to expend the funds
to monopolize the telephone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended regulations also help Bureau staff to more effectively prevent telephone use by those inmates who have
abused their telephone privileges. Under the former system, if an inmate had abused his or her telephone privilege,
for example, by using a telephone to engage in criminal activity, and had then undergone an administrative hearing
affording limited due process, a Discipline Hearing Officer could restrict the inmate's use of the telephone for
a given period of time. However, there was no effective way to enforce that sanction. The Bureau was forced to rely upon
staff to observe the inmate using the telephone after the restriction had been imposed. Given the fact that the Bureau
incarcerates as many as 2,000 inmates in one institution, and that inmate telephones may be in various locations within
the institution, limited staff resources make it very difficult to conduct continuous surveillance of specific
inmates with restricted telephone privileges. With the ITS, the Bureau can mechanically block the telephone calls
of those inmates on telephone restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The amended regulations better assist Bureau staff in detecting and preventing criminal activity facilitated
through use of the telephone. The former collect call system is more easily used by inmates to direct criminal activity
from prison, such as committing fraud, facilitating drug operations, intimidating witnesses, and managing the
fruits of their crimes. Cases have been developed over the years which involve attempts by inmates to defraud members
of the public and, in some cases, financial corporations. Examples include credit card fraud, securities fraud,
and various forms of insurance and tax fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This problem is not unique to the Bureau. In 1989, the telephone industry estimated an annual loss of $150 million from
institutional toll fraud, including that which occurs in prisons. Officials from Consolidated Communications,
Inc., a long-distance carrier for 25 correctional facilities in Illinois, were quoted by United Press International
on July 5, 1993, as stating ``[f]raud is rampant because inmates have found ways to outfox the system that makes them
reverse charges on long-distance calls made from prison phones. Bills for up to 20 percent of the long-distance calls
are uncollectable.'' The Bureau notes that these losses have prompted the telephone companies and several state
and local correctional systems to look at ways to solve the problems associated with the collect call system.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By restricting the inmates' access to collect telephone service, the amended regulations should help substantially
reduce the possibility that inmates will be able to reverse the charges or have their calls billed to a person who has
no intention of paying the charges. In addition, the ITS provides increased assistance in the investigation of criminal
activity, such as escape plots or plans to introduce contraband into prison. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended regulations also enable the Bureau to prevent an inmate or group of inmates from calling a specific telephone
number. By doing so, the Bureau can better protect a victim, witness, or other member of the public from harassment,
and can better prevent calls that pose a threat to institution security and good order or to the public. The ability
to block recipient numbers also helps the Bureau prevent one inmate from calling another inmate's family, a method
of intimidation or extortion between inmates. This capability is not available under the former collect call system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, by ordinarily restricting inmate calls to parties identified on the inmate's official telephone list
(28 CFR 540.101(a)), the amended regulations should help reduce the possibility that inmates will use the telephone
to engage in criminal activity or to harass people who do not want to receive their calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The amended regulations and direct-dial telephone service also provide inmates with several advantages over
the former collect call system. Among these advantages are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The amended regulations should facilitate more equitable access of the telephones for all inmates, by permitting
the Warden to limit the maximum length of inmate telephone calls based upon institution conditions, such as institution
population or usage demand. The ITS, which can be programmed to terminate a telephone call automatically after the
expiration of a certain period of time, and which permits debit-billing from the inmates' trust fund accounts, should
help reduce an inmate's ability to monopolize telephones, thereby helping to ensure more equitable telephone access
for all inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Inmates may place direct-dialed international calls. This is a particular benefit to the large percentage of the
Bureau inmate population (over twenty-five percent in June 1993) who are non-United States citizens with families
in other countries. Many of these inmates had difficulty communicating by telephone with their families because
telephone carriers do not always process international collect calls. Some of the inmate commenters acknowledged
this problem by stating that their home countries did not accept collect calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Inmates may place direct-dialed calls to persons who cannot accept collect calls because, for example, their home
telephones have been restricted by their telephone service company from receiving collect calls, or their workplaces
do not accept collect calls. Similarly, inmates may call offices, such as their children's schools, which may not
accept collect calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Unlike operator-assisted collect calls, inmates making direct-dialed calls have a greater opportunity to leave
a message with the person who answers the telephone or, in some cases, on the answering machine of the person called.
One of the inmate commenters acknowledged this by listing several examples of instances where he may not be able to
make contacts through the collect call system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The amended regulations will help assist staff in contacting inmates' families in emergency situations. Because
many inmates are serving long sentences, the telephone numbers and addresses given upon initial incarceration may
no longer be valid. As a result, staff have had difficulty locating next of kin for seriously ill inmates, or in other
emergency situations. The inmate telephone lists required by the amended regulations will provide staff with a list
of up-to-date telephone numbers for each inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended regulations help satisfy the above-listed correctional management objectives, which are consistent
with the statutory responsibility of the Attorney General, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. 4001 and 4042, and delegated to
the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in 28 CFR 0.96. Paragraph (p) of Section 0.96 empowers the Director to promulgate
rules governing the control and management of Federal penal and correctional institutions and providing for the
classification, government, discipline, treatment, care, rehabilitation, and reformation of inmates confined
within those facilities.

Response to Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule were received from inmates, members of the general public, and other interested parties.
The majority of inmate comments consisted of form letters from one institution. A summary of the comments and response
to these follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Use of Commissary Trust Fund
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter disagreed with the proposed rule, suggesting that the Bureau of Prisons is not expending the Commissary
Trust Fund profits in accordance with the terms of the trust, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1321(b) (1993). This commenter
expressed a belief that all federal inmates are the beneficiaries of the trust and any expenditure must benefit the
inmate population ``as a whole.'' In this commenter's view, the ITS does not benefit all inmates and, thus, is not a
proper expenditure from the trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau disagrees with this comment. The Commissary Trust Fund, and the commissary system that it finances, were
established to further the Bureau's security and correctional management goals by permitting inmates to purchase
goods and services not regularly provided by the Bureau. To encourage inmate financial responsibility and to further
the Bureau's other correctional management and security concerns discussed above, it is appropriate to charge inmates
for the costs of their telephone calls. In addition, inmates have no entitlement to a telephone system provided at
government expense. It is, therefore, appropriate to charge inmates for the costs of their telephone calls, to deposit
the revenue from the inmate telephone calls into the Commissary Trust Fund, and to use Commissary Trust Fund revenues
to pay for the expenses of the ITS telephone system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operation of the ITS through the Commissary Trust Fund will also benefit the inmate body as a whole because the ITS
telephone rates, like the prices for other goods and services sold in Bureau commissaries, are designed to cover the
cost of providing the service and to leave a profit in the Commissary Trust Fund. Thus, after the ITS is fully operational
and start-up expenses have been recouped, the ITS is expected to increase the amount of Commissary Trust Fund money
available for the procurement of books, recreational equipment, or other items that benefit the inmate population
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the trust documents establishing the Commissary Trust Fund, Department of Justice Circular 2126 (1930)
and Department of Justice Circular 2244 (1932), give the Director of the Bureau of Prisons the sole discretionary
authority to determine which items will be sold through institution commissaries and how, if at all, any Commissary
Trust Fund profits will be disbursed. Both trust documents also authorize the Bureau to restrict inmates' commissary
privileges to further penological goals and state that inmates are not entitled to any profits derived from the operation
of institution commissaries. Thus, while the Commissary Trust Fund benefits the inmate population ``as a whole,''
inmates are not legal ``beneficiaries'' of the trust and have no right to control Commissary Trust Fund expenditures.
For the reasons stated in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,'' the Bureau has determined
that the ITS benefits both the inmate population and the public, such as protecting the public from inmate telephone
abuse, and furthers the Bureau's correctional goals. It is appropriate, therefore, to pay the ITS expenses from the
Commissary Trust Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter also contended that because the ITS program has enhanced security features, it should be paid for
by using other appropriations. The commenter referenced 18 U.S.C. 4007, which calls for expenses attendant to the
confinement of prisoners to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Bureau first notes that security equipment and supplies used to record telephone calls are not funded
by Commissary Trust Fund revenues. Rather, funds for this equipment and these supplies will continue to be allocated
from other appropriated Bureau funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the other security features, the Bureau believes that one of its primary objectives is to ensure the security
and good order of Bureau institutions, thereby benefitting both the inmate population as a whole and the public. It
is not inappropriate to expend Commissary Trust Fund profits on the ITS merely because the system assists in achieving
this goal.

Finally, with respect to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4007, the Bureau notes that Congress recently passed legislation
which provides for inmates to pay for the costs of the first year of their incarceration, if they can afford to do so.
See 18 U.S.C. 4001; Section 111 of Public Law 102&hyph;395 (106 stat. 1842). Thus, the Bureau does not read 18 U.S.C.
4007 as precluding the sale of goods and services in institution commissaries or charging the inmates with other fees
authorized by law.

2. Replacement of Collect Call System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters requested the retention of inmate collect call on demand privileges. These commenters recommended
that the direct-dial system be added to, rather than replace, the collect call system, so that what the commenters
refer to as a ``dual system'' could operate. The ``dual system'' would continue the collect call on demand capability
of the former collect call system. The Bureau responds as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. As an initial matter, the Bureau notes that these comments may be based upon a belief that, with the installation
of the ITS, inmates would no longer be allowed to make collect calls. However, the amended regulations allow for limited
collect calling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, the Bureau recognized that there is a need for inmates to be able to make collect calls in specific
instances, such as emergencies, or for holdovers or pre-trial inmates. Section 540.101(d) of the proposed rule specifically
addresses this issue. As expanded in the final rule, this section, now &sect;540.101(e), provides for a more comprehensive
listing of those persons who have a need to make collect calls, such as new arrivals, including new commitments and
transfers, and inmates without funds. Similarly, final &sect;540.105(b) specifically provides for collect calls
to be available for inmates without funds. See further discussion below, in the section entitled ``7. COSTS.&blank;.&blank;.
d. Inmates without funds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Several inmate commenters complained that their low institution earnings and need to purchase personal hygiene
items would prevent them from making as many direct-dialed telephone calls as they could make with the collect call
system. While it is true that inmates do not earn regular scale wages, neither do they have regular living expenses,
such as housing, clothing, food, medical and dental. In addition, the Bureau's existing policy on grooming, codified
at 28 CFR part 551, subpart A, provides for the Warden to make available to inmates those articles necessary for maintaining
personal hygiene. The Bureau's internal implementing language to that provision provides that the basic hygiene
items to be made available to inmates include soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste or powder, combs, shaving supplies,
and feminine hygiene products. Inmate complaints regarding provision of these basic items should be addressed through
the Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR part 542. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average inmate has ample discretionary funds to purchase items of a personal interest, such as additional hygiene
and cosmetic items, and direct-dialed telephone calls. As of October 1993, the monthly inmate trust fund account
balance averaged $115.78 per inmate. Through June 1993, the annual commissary purchases made by inmates averaged
$1,046.87 per inmate. At the institution where the majority of inmate comments on this rule originated, the annual
commissary purchases averaged $1,254.09 per inmate and the average monthly inmate trust fund account balance was
$101.95 per inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the amended regulations encourage the inmates to establish spending priorities and to choose between
such items as telephone calls, cigarettes, candy, and special hygiene products, thus furthering the correctional
goal of assistng inmates to be financially responsible. The average citizen who must live within a budget must make
similar spending choices, and may not be able to pay for any more long-distance calls than the two to three calls a month
that one inmate commenter complained was only possible within his budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we do not agree with comments implying that it is wrong to require inmates to make choices on how to
spend their funds. However, the Bureau believes that it is necessary to address telephone access for inmates without
sufficient funds. The Bureau's accommodations on that point are noted below in the section entitled ``7. COSTS. .
.d. Inmates without funds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Some inmate commenters stated that the proposed regulations would force them to beg for telephone money from the
people they want to call. The Bureau believes that such characterization also applies to the solicitation to accept
a collect call. As one inmate commenter stated, ``[i]t is belittling for me to have to call anyone collect.'' Although
this commenter advocated the installation of ``regular pay telephones,'' he preferred to place direct-dialed calls
that he could pay for, rather than his family, because his family had experienced serious difficulties due to the large
telephone bills from collect calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Some commenters requested the retention of the collect call system so that they can pay for an inmate's telephone
calls. Commenters stated, in a form letter, that ``[t]he new telephone system would force me to send money to ensure
that loved ones could call, but would offer no means of controlling if calls were made [to] me or the money was spent otherwise.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the amended regulations, people who would accept an inmate's collect calls may send the inmate money to defray
the cost of the direct-dialed calls. As discussed in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,''
this will provide the inmate with an opportunity to demonstrate the responsible use of resources provided by the community.
The recipients of an inmate's calls should also benefit as they can send less money to the inmate for the same amount
of telephone time since the direct-dial rates are, on average, less expensive than the former collect-call rates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To further address the commenters' concerns, the Bureau has added a provision to its final rule, excluding from the
inmate's IFRP calculation a set amount of monies deposited into the inmate's trust fund account. See 28 CFR 545.11(b)
and further discussion below in the section entitled ``4. Conditioning Use of the Its Upon Participation in the IFRP.''
This helps ensure that the inmate is able to make telephone calls with monies sent to the inmate from members of the community
for telephone calls. If the inmate elects not to use these funds to call the sender of the money, the sender has the option
of not forwarding additional monies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Some commenters believe that the actual administration of the ITS may be more expensive because additional staff
will be needed to operate the system. Implementation of the ITS at most institutions does require additional employees
who are responsible for the operation of the ITS. However, the Bureau believes that the costs for additional staff
are well justified by the significant benefits of the ITS, described above in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE
AMENDED REGULATIONS.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Comments stated that a ``dual system'' would not be difficult or costly to install and maintain; e.g., that ``the
systems already installed at institutions could be reprogrammed very easily *&blank;*&blank;* with little or no
modification of existing equipment.'' The Bureau disagrees with this position. The contract for the ITS was awarded
for a primarily direct-dial system. The contractor estimates that it would cost several million dollars to modify
the system to provide collect call on demand capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Finally, there are security reasons for rejecting the commenters' suggestion that the final regulations be amended
to permit inmates to make collect calls on demand. As noted above in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,''
inmates are able to use the unlimited collect call system to engage in various forms of harassment and criminal activity.
Providing a ``dual system'' that would permit inmates to call anyone collect would do nothing to resolve these problems.
For example, an inmate could still bill a call to a party who has no intention of paying. An inmate also could more easily
monopolize the telephone, due to the absence of financial constraints on that inmate, and resulting tensions could
jeopardize the safety and security of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It might be possible to curb some of this abuse by limiting inmate collect calls to numbers on an approved telephone
list and requiring those inmates to use Personal Access Codes (PACs) similar to those required by these amended regulations
for making direct-dialed ITS calls. However, again, this would not prevent inmates from billing calls to a party who
has no intention of paying. In addition, inmates would have less of an incentive to keep secret their PACs, as required
in 28 CFR 540.101(c). The PACs could be used to place collect calls, for which the inmates bear no financial responsibility,
rather than direct-dialed calls, for which the inmates are financially responsible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would undermine many of the security features of the ITS because it would be more difficult for the Bureau to monitor
and restrict illegal or abusive inmate telephone calls if the Bureau did not know which inmate was using which PAC.
Similarly, an inmate could circumvent some of the telephone list restrictions by using other inmates' PACs to call
numbers that he or she was not permitted to call. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In concluding a response on this issue, the Bureau believes that restricting collect calls on demand furthers important
penological and security goals. At the same time, the final rule adequately addresses the needs of inmates to make
collect calls in appropriate circumstances. For these reasons, the Bureau has decided not to implement a ``dual system''
with collect call on demand capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Constitutional Concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that operation of the ITS is a violation of the constitutional rights of inmates and others,
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. First Amendment rights to free speech. Several commenters claimed that the proposed regulations violate their
First Amendment rights to free speech without providing any detail as to the alleged violations. Our review of the
comments on this issue suggests that at least some of the the arguments are based on inaccurate or unrealistic expectations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau, by implementing the ITS, does not intend to, nor does it, unconstitutionally restrict an inmate's opportunity
for freedom of speech. Bureau regulations provide for several means of communication, including correspondence,
visiting and telephones. See 28 CFR part 540, subparts B and D. The revised rule is not intended to, nor does it, prevent
an inmate from exercising his or her right to communicate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One inmate commenter said that he would have personally called in his comments on the proposed rule but that ``the number
was not approved.'' The Bureau points out that this commenter would not have been able to call in his comments under
the former collect call system either, as the Bureau does not accept collect calls and the appropriate method for commenting
on proposed regulations is to send written comments to the Bureau. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, an association of newspaper editors and reporters, asserted that the ITS hinders the rights of the
press and the public to gain access to important information about prison inmates and prison conditions. Primary
concerns expressed by the commenter were that the revised telephone regulations would hamper the ability of inmates
to communicate with the press and that the regulations potentially threaten the relationship between journalists
and their sources; that restrictions on collect calls and the use of an authorized telephone list establish procedural
hurdles placing significant new burdens on the inmate's ability to reach the community; that the ITS does not allow
for timely telephone access to the media; that the disclosure by a journalist of the information required by the Request
for Telephone Privilege form was inappropriate. The commenter noted that journalists do not have to provide this
information in order to receive Special Mail from inmates. The commenter further indicated that while Bureau regulations
may implicate substantial government interests, the regulatory sweep is too broad.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an initial matter, the Bureau's revised telephone regulations do not conflict with what the commenter seems to
identify as a First Amendment requirement that prisoners be allowed to call members of the news media. Inmates have
no First Amendment entitlement to telephone use, or to the unrestricted use of the telephone. See

the Supreme Court held that alternative means of communication is a relevant factor in balancing First Amendment
rights with legitimate government interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specifically, the Bureau notes that the new regulations permit inmates to list telephone numbers for members
of the media on the same terms and conditions as telephone numbers for any other person. Thus, a member of the news media,
as with any other person, may be included on an inmate's telephone list except when Bureau staff determine that contact
with the person will pose a threat to institution security and good order, or a threat to the public. See 28 CFR 540.101(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, as the commenter acknowledges, the Bureau affords inmates the opportunity to write to members of the
news media via sealed correspondence identified as ``Special Mail.'' See 28 CFR part 540, subpart B. Similarly, as
the commenter also acknowledges, Bureau regulations (see 28 CFR part 540, subpart E), provide for media visits to
prisons to observe conditions and interview inmates. These provisions provide the news media ample opportunity
to have effective communications with those in prison. Thus, while 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Saxbe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 held that the press has no First Amendment right to greater access than the public, the Bureau, through its Special
Mail and contact with the news media provisions, has elected to provide the news media with such privileges. The revised
telephone regulations do not change or affect the regulations regarding Special Mail or media visits. The revised
telephone regulations will continue to work in concert with current Bureau regulations on correspondence, visits,
and contacts with the news media. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter, while acknowledging the existence of these opportunities between inmates and the press, asserts
that mail does not offer the advantages of instant communication available through the telephone. We specifically
disagree with the commenter's subsequent statement that the proposed rule is inappropriate because ``*&blank;*&blank;*
an initial telephone conversation may often be required to convince a busy journalist that an inmate's story truly
is newsworthy.'' Regulations for inmate telephone use are intended to provide inmates with a supplemental means
of communication that is consistent with other aspects of correctional management, and are not intended to function
as a convenience for the news media in the editorial decision-making process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments suggested that the revised telephone regulations impose an unconstitutional prior restraint on First
Amendment freedoms. For reasons discussed below, in the section entitled ``5. LIST OF NUMBERS TO BE CALLED.'', the
Bureau believes that requiring inmates to submit lists of telephone numbers does not constitute an unconstitutional
prior restraint. Briefly, this procedure furthers legitimate governmental interests in maintaining the safety
and security of Bureau institutions; the Associate Warden may deny placement of a telephone number on an inmate's
telephone list if he or she determines that there is a threat to institution security and good order or a threat to the
public; and any disapproval must be explained in writing, and is subject to appeal through the Administrative Remedy
Program. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with respect to the Request for Telephone Privilege form (``form''), the Bureau has decided to discontinue
use of the form, for reasons described below in the section entitled ``b. Fourth Amendment rights to privacy.'' Rather,
except for immediate family members and those persons already on an inmate's visiting list, a letter will be sent to
potential recipients of telephone calls to notify them that they have been placed on an inmate's telephone list and
to inform them of the procedure to follow if they do not want to receive calls from that inmate. No specific information
is required from potential recipients. This change should substantially accommodate concerns on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. Several non-inmate commenters claimed that the proposed regulations violate
their Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. Some comments objected to the form addressed to potential recipients of
inmate telephone calls, claiming that they should not have to be ``investigated'' in order to receive a telephone
call. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Request for Telephone Privilege form (``form''), as originally developed by the Bureau, included questions
as to the relationship of the recipient to the requesting inmate, possible criminal background of the recipient,
and contacts, if any, of the recipient with other inmates. The Bureau has reassessed the benefits of this form and has
decided to discontinue its use. Therefore, the proposed rule has been revised to provide for potential telephone
call recipients (other than immediate family or persons on the inmate's visiting list) to be notified in writing that
they have been placed on an inmate's telephone list. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(2). The written notice informs recipients
that they can notify the institution in writing if they do not want to receive calls from the inmate. The notice does
not request any information from the recipient, and the recipient will not have to return the notice to the institution
in order to receive calls from the inmate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment stated that consent should be sought from those persons whose names and telephone numbers have been
placed on an inmate's telephone list. For several reasons, the Bureau disagrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, requiring each recipient's prior consent would impose an administrative burden resulting in delayed processing
of inmate telephone lists. Specifically, obtaining prior consent would require the Bureau to send each potential
recipient a form asking if the recipient wanted to receive an inmate's calls. If the potential recipient wanted to
receive the calls, he or she would then have to return the completed form back to the institution before the number could
be entered on the inmate's telephone list. During the weeks or months to complete this process, the inmate would be
unable to place non-emergency calls to this potential recipient. This anticipated delay was a matter of concern to
some commenters and is avoided in the final rule by discontinuing the use of the form requesting prior consent from
potential recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, to the extent that non-inmate commenters were concerned about receiving unwanted calls from inmates, the
Bureau believes that this concern is substantially alleviated by sending a notice letter to potential recipients
other than an inmate's immediate family and persons on the inmate's visiting list. In the event a recipient subsequently
notifies us in writing that he or she does not wish to be contacted, the recipient will be removed from the inmate's list.
See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A letter will not be sent to an inmate's immediate family and persons on the inmate's visiting list because the Bureau
assumes that these individuals would not object to receiving telephone calls from the inmate. Of course, if these
individuals do not want to receive calls from an inmate, they may simply notify the Bureau in writing and the Bureau
will remove their numbers from the inmate's telephone list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the final rule contains other provisions that seek to protect the public from harassing or unwanted inmate
calls. First, the rule provides that the inmate shall acknowledge that, to the best of the inmate's knowledge, the
person or persons on the list are agreeable to receiving the inmate's telephone call and that the proposed calls are
to be made for a purpose allowable under Bureau policy or institutional guidelines. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(1). Inmates
who violate this provision may be subject to discipline. See 28 CFR 540.100(a). Also, the Bureau may deny a proposed
telephone number if it determines that the inmate's ability to call that number would pose a threat to the public. See
28 CFR 540.101(a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Bureau's compiling of inmate telephone lists to effectively manage a debit-billing telephone system
does not violate any Fourth Amendment privacy rights of the recipient. This information is voluntarily provided
to the Bureau by inmates who seek to make telephone calls and there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in this information.
A person's telephone number is known by the telephone company and the people who call the number, as well as by the person
to whom the number is listed. See

In addition, the monitoring of inmate telephone conversations (other than properly placed calls to attorneys) is
a matter of public record. See newly designated 28 CFR 540.102 (formerly &sect;540.101). A number of courts have upheld
this practice as permissible under federal wiretap statutes (See, e.g.,

c. Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Several commenters claimed that the proposed regulations violate their Sixth
Amendment right to counsel. One commenter noted that ``in this policy there are no guidelines for legal calls.'' Some
commenters claimed that the proposed regulations prevent or in some manner limit legal calls. We disagree. The amended
telephone regulations do not affect an inmate's access to unmonitored telephone conversations with his or her attorney.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Separate provisions continue to exist for inmates to make unmonitored legal calls and these provisions remain unchanged
by the revised telephone regulations, although the Bureau has redesignated them from 28 CFR 540.101 and 540.102 to
28 CFR 540.102 and 540.103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as provided in redesignated &sect;540.103, the Warden may not apply frequency limitations on unmonitored
inmate telephone calls to attorneys when the inmate demonstrates that communication with attorneys by correspondence,
visiting, or normal telephone use is not adequate. We also note that an inmate may choose to place an attorney on his
or her telephone list, with the understanding that calls placed on the ITS are subject to monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the above reasons, the amended telephone regulations do not change inmate access to unmonitored attorney telephone
calls and therefore do not interfere with an inmate's right to counsel.

4. Conditioning Use of the ITS Upon Participation in the IFRP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters objected to conditioning inmate telephone use upon the inmate's participation in the Bureau's
Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP). These objections were based upon a variety of concerns, and are
addressed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a general matter, and as noted in the proposed rule, the IFRP offers inmates the opportunity to develop a plan to meet
certain legitimate financial obligations and to make payments toward fulfilling that plan. Examples of these obligations
include court-ordered restitution, fines, or other government obligations. The effects of non-participation
are set forth in the Bureau's existing rule on inmate financial responsibility. See &sect;545.11(d) of 28 CFR part
545, subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, the Bureau added a new provision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;545.11(d) which would ordinarily limit the inmate's telephone use to one call every three months. For the reasons
discussed above in the section entitled ``PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS,'' the Bureau believes that it is appropriate
to restrict the telephone access of inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP. However, the Bureau is modifying
this rule to provide no more than one inmate-paid call every month for inmates in IFRP-refuse status, unless the Warden
allows additional inmate-paid calls for compelling circumstances. See 28 CFR &sect;545.11(d)(10). Inmates in
IFRP-refuse status may also make unmonitored attorney calls pursuant to the procedures specified in redesignated
&sect;&sect;540.102 and 540.103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As modified, the rule will enable inmates in IFRP-refuse status to have access to the telephone, while still contributing
significantly to an important correctional management goal of the Bureau: the inmate's increased acceptance of
personal responsibility. One inmate commenter seems to acknowledge this, in part, by stating, ``[i]f you got (fine,
asse[ss]ment) *&blank;*&blank;* you cannot call home or use phone period if you don't pay *&blank;*&blank;*. This
system of (phone bills) *&blank;*&blank;* affect[s] me [by] *&blank;*&blank;* forc[ing] me to pay $300.00 fine.''
As noted in the above section entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PURPOSE OF THE AMENDED REGULATIONS
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and illustrated by the above comment, the Bureau believes that the ITS is an additional incentive for inmates to
participate in the IFRP and pay their debts to society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments objected to the operation of the IFRP itself, claiming that it punishes inmates without due process, or that
it was administered in an unfair manner. The IFRP is not intended to be, nor is it, a disciplinary sanction; rather,
it is a voluntary program used as a factor to assess inmate progress in accepting financial responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IFRP has been duly promulgated through the rulemaking process and upheld by the courts. See

 493 U.S. 870. Objections to its operation other than as relevant to telephones lie outside the scope of this rulemaking.
The Bureau does note, however, that the Administrative Remedy Program (see 28 CFR part 542) provides a means for inmates
who wish to challenge IFRP payment schedules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to the operation of the IFRP with respect to telephones, stating that inmate family or friends
are afraid or unwilling to send money to an inmate for telephone calls because the sender has no control over how that
money would be spent. These commenters expressed concern that money sent to inmates for use in payment of long distance
telephone calls will be used to recalculate the inmate's resources in determining an IFRP payment schedule. Consequently,
they feel that some of this money will be used to make payments toward the inmate's fines rather than to pay for telephone
calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this concern, the Bureau is amending its rule to provide that $50.00 of the money deposited into an inmate's
trust fund account each month will not be considered in determining the IFRP payment schedule. See revised 28 CFR 545.11(b).
For purposes of this calculation, the inmate trust fund account deposits include both institution wages and funds
sent to the inmate from members of the community. The only limitation on the $50.00 monthly exemption is the minimum
requirement for IFRP contributions from UNICOR and non-UNICOR work assignments, as set forth in existing 28 CFR 545.11(b)(1)
and (b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $50.00 monthly amount was chosen because it is high enough to enable the inmates to make a significant number of
telephone calls. At the same time, however, the Bureau believes that there should be a specific limit on the amount
of funds that will be excluded from calculation in determining the inmate's financial plan. The $50.00 exclusion
provides a clear rule that is easier to administer than one which states that any funds designated for telephone calls
will be excluded from the calculation of an inmate's financial plan. Also, the Bureau believes that inmates should
be encouraged to fulfill their financial obligations, e.g. pay court-imposed fines. The provisions of new &sect;545.11(d)(10),
along with existing 28 CFR 545.11(b), help achieve the objectives of both the commenters and the Bureau. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerns were expressed that the proposed regulations place unfair telephone restrictions on inmates who cannot
participate in the IFRP because they do not have the funds to pay their fines. Such complaints are based upon inaccurate
assumptions that inmates, by not participating in the IFRP, are prevented from having full telephone access.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau's internal implementing instructions to staff regarding the IFRP clearly state that inmates may be temporarily
exempt from IFRP participation when it is impossible for them to meet minimum payment schedules because of their inability
to secure institution employment beyond maintenance pay and because of their absence of community resources. Such
inmates will not be placed in IFRP refuse status. Therefore, they would not be affected by telephone restrictions
based upon refusal to participate in the IFRP. Further discussion concerning telephone access for inmates without
funds is discussed below, in the section entitled ``7. COSTS...d. Inmates without funds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter objected to the IFRP provision, stating that an inmate with a fine who refused to participate in the IFRP
could not call home or use the telephone at all. This commenter also claimed that the regulation ``cuts off'' all outside
contact, including mail and visiting, if no fine is paid. These contentions are not true. As noted in other sections
of this preamble, inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP have a variety of ways to communicate, including written
correspondence. They also may make a limited number of telephone calls, as discussed above. Therefore, an inmate's
outside contact is not ``cut off'' if the inmate refuses to participate in the IFRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter complained that conditioning inmate telephone use upon IFRP participation in effect forced
him to work in an industrial assignment and alleged that many inmates (20%) would not work in Federal Prison Industries
assignments except for the IFRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau first notes that industrial positions have long been requested by inmates because of the higher wages and
the opportunity to learn skills for employment upon release. As noted by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, ``[a]
Federal Prison industries job assignment *&blank;*&blank;* is considered by many inmates to be more desirable than
other types of work assignments *&blank;*&blank;*''

 866 F.2d 627, 628 (3rd Cir., 1989). In fact, many institutions historically have had waiting lists of applicants for
these positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even so, the Bureau believes that the operation of both the IFRP and the ITS will result in increased interest in industrial
assignments, as suggested by this commenter, whose very complaint demonstrates one of the Bureau's purposes in amending
these regulations. As a final note, even though institutions may have waiting lists for industrial assignments,
existing Bureau policy provides for IFRP participants with obligations of at least $250.00 to receive priority placement
on industrial assignment waiting lists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the IFRP remains a voluntary program. The amended telephone regulations are intended to encourage
inmates to work, accept personal responsibility, responsibly manage their finances, and pay their fines and other
legal obligations. For the reasons stated in the section entitled ``

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Several commenters objected to the portion of the proposed rule in &sect;540.101(a) that specified that inmate calls
ordinarily shall be placed to a number on their approved telephone lists, which may contain up to 20 telephone numbers.
Some commenters seemed to object to having any list at all or favored no restrictions as to who goes on the list, with
the Bureau giving notice prior to a name being taken off the list. Other comments concerned the limitation of 20 numbers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are sound correctional reasons for requiring that inmate calls ordinarily be placed to a number on an approved
telephone list. Among them are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the former collect call system, there have been instances in which members of the public, including court personnel,
victims, and family of former inmate associates, reported receiving abusive or harassing telephone calls from inmates
and requested that the Bureau preclude the inmate from calling them in the future. As noted above in the section entitled
``Purpose of the Amended Regulations,'' there were also cases in which inmates used the telephone to engage in criminal
activity. Short of standing next to the telephone and watching every call the inmate made_a nearly impossible task
given the large number of inmates and the limited number of staff at the institutions_the Bureau has no practical way
to prevent such an inmate from making additional improper calls through the former collect call system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended regulations are expected to help reduce inmate abuse of telephone privileges. By requiring that potential
recipients of inmate telephone calls be notified that they have been placed on an inmate's telephone list (other than
immediate family members or those persons who are already on the inmate's approved visitor list) and by limiting calls
to numbers on the telephone list, the amended regulations help protect the public, including witnesses, victims,
or other people who do not wish to have contact with the inmate, from receiving unwanted inmate telephone calls. In
addition, by permitting the Associate Warden to deny placement of a number on an inmate's telephone list, the regulations
provide an opportunity to prohibit telephone calls to persons that are determined to be a threat to the security and
good order of the institution, or a threat to the public, before the calls occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that the Bureau removes a number from an inmate's telephone list and the inmate then uses the telephone
to harass that individual (by using another inmate's PAC number, for example), the inmate can be disciplined for violating
regulations, as the inmate is required to acknowledge that persons on the telephone list are agreeable to receiving
the inmate's telephone calls and that the calls will be made for permissible purposes. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(1) and
&sect;540.104, formerly &sect;540.103. The telephone list requirement is intended to help protect inmates as well.
In a debit-billing system, there will be some incentive for one inmate (Inmate A) to use another inmate's (Inmate B's)
PAC number to make telephone calls charged to Inmate B's account. However, this incentive is substantially reduced
if Inmate A can only call the approved numbers on Inmate B's telephone list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters claimed that inmates should be permitted to call more than 20 numbers. The proposed rule limited the
telephone lists to 20 numbers because the Bureau believes that number is high enough to accommodate the needs of the
average inmate without undermining the security justifications for the list and unduly burdening Bureau staff.
This belief is supported by a recent sampling of five ITS-activated institutions, which indicates that the inmate
ITS accounts, on average, listed fewer than 10 telephone numbers and that 92 percent of the inmate ITS accounts listed
fewer than 20 telephone numbers. Specifically, of the approximately 10,730 inmate ITS accounts surveyed, less than
900 inmate ITS accounts listed 20 telephone numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to comments that some inmates desire to submit more than 20 numbers, the Bureau is amending these
regulations to allow an inmate to place up to 30 numbers on the telephone list. The Bureau believes that for those inmates
with such a need, the submission of up to 30 numbers may effectively be handled by staff without undermining the security
reasons for maintaining a list of numbers. The final rule also provides that the Associate Warden may authorize the
placement of additional numbers on the inmate's telephone list based on the inmate's individual situation, e.g.,
size of family. See 28 CFR 540.101(a). This change should accommodate the requests of inmates desiring to submit more
than 30 numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the inmate commenters seeking unlimited numbers on his telephone list also requested authority to call 800
numbers and to receive pre-paid credit cards from telephone companies. Use of 800 numbers and pre-paid credit cards
would undermine the correctional management objectives of the ITS listed above in the section entitled ``Purpose
of the Amended Regulations''. If an inmate has a need to call an 800 number under compelling circumstances, a request
should be made for a staff-assisted call, as provided in 28 CFR 540.105(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested that the Bureau should permit inmates to submit updates to the list more frequently than once
a quarter. The Bureau believes that the amendment to the final rule providing that inmate telephone lists may contain
up to 30 numbers, rather than 20, should reduce generally the need for more than quarterly updates, as provided in these
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the final rule also adds the phrase ``at least'' to provide the Warden the authority to allow more frequent
updates, if appropriate. In addition, if an inmate has a demonstrated need for making a call to a number that is not on
the inmate's telephone list, the inmate may be permitted to make additional calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerns were expressed about delays in processing updates to the telephone lists, once inmates have submitted their
requests. The final rule will eliminate processing delays caused by the requirement in the proposed rule that the
written authorization form be returned prior to placement of the telephone number on the inmate's telephone list.
The final rule discontinues use of this form and ordinarily permits the immediate placement of telephone numbers
on the inmate's telephone list. In addition, to avoid undue processing delays, the Bureau's implementing guidelines
provide that once initial lists and updates are submitted, staff will process them ordinarily within ten working
days.

Some comments objected to Bureau staff review of numbers submitted, suggesting that such review would be arbitrary
and without standards. Another comment stated that the new rule constitutes a loss of opportunity to call all persons
without a prior restraint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau's rule does not prevent an inmate from submitting any telephone number he or she chooses to submit, including
telephone numbers for persons other than family and friends. As revised, the final rule provides for the requested
telephone numbers to be added to the inmate's telephone list. Further, the final rule modifies proposed &sect;540.101(a)
with respect to specifying the grounds for rejection of requested numbers. As modified, that provision, now 28 CFR
540.101(a)(3), states that the Associate Warden may deny placement of a telephone number on an inmate's telephone
list if the Associate Warden determines that there is a threat to institution security and good order or a threat to
the public. Any disapproval must be documented in writing to both the inmate and the proposed recipient of the calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau notes that one commenter acknowledged that ``*&blank;*&blank;* some of this [disapproval] is understandable,
i.e., security, threats to the public safety; *&blank;*&blank;*'' Examples of situations that may warrant rejection
include, but are not limited to, indication that the proposed recipient of the call is involved in the introduction
of contraband into the institution, in an escape plot, or in other activity threatening the public safety, such as
harassing victims or witnesses. The rejection of a number may be appealed, as discussed in the next section.

6. No Separate Appeal Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters complained that the proposed rule does not provide for any separate appeal of ITS-related decisions,
specifically, decisions concerning the inmate's list of numbers to be called. The Bureau believes it is unnecessary
to provide for any separate ITS appeal process because a program is already in place which is well-known and used by
inmates to raise individual concerns about any correctional issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All inmates entering BOP institutions are informed of the Administrative Remedy Program, described in 28 CFR part
542. Briefly, the Program operates as follows: At the institution level, an inmate may raise concerns formally by
filing a Request for Administrative Remedy on a form known as a BP&hyph;9. If the inmate disagrees with the Warden's
response, he or she may file an Appeal to the Regional Director on a form known as a BP&hyph;10. If the inmate is dissatisfied
with the Regional Director's response, he or she may file an Appeal to the Office of the General Counsel on a form known
as a BP&hyph;11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrative Remedy Program is available for inmates to raise individual ITS-related complaints. Recently,
the Bureau surveyed all institutions where the ITS has been implemented to determine the level of concern. This survey
showed that only a very small number of ITS-related Administrative Remedy requests and appeals have been filed. In
fact, only one percent or less of the total Administrative Remedy requests and appeals filed during the survey period
were ITS-related.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the successful operation of the Administrative Remedy Program, the Bureau finds no reason to provide for any
separate inmate appeal process in the revised telephone regulations. However, in response to these comments, the
Bureau is modifying the final rule to include a reference to the Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(3).

As amended, the final rule provides two remedies for individuals in the community who may wish to contest a decision
to deny placement of their telephone number on an inmate's telephone list. The first option is for the involved inmate
to file the aforementioned Administrative Remedy request. The second option is for the person in the community to
write to the Warden requesting reconsideration of the decision. A statement to this effect has been added to the rule.

7. Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments regarding costs of ITS telephone calls include the following four areas of concern:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Charging inmates for calls. Some commenters objected to inmates paying for their calls directly, claiming that
it was unfair for inmates to have to choose between making telephone calls and purchasing other items in the commissary.
The Bureau's response to these objections is set forth above in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response to Public Comment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section entitled ``2. Replacement of Collect Call System'', part b. In addition, these comments disregard the fact
that the Bureau's telephone regulations have always stated that inmates are responsible for the costs of their calls.
See former &sect;540.104. It is only recently, however, that the Bureau has had the technical capability to bill the
inmates directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One inmate commenter apparently prefers to pay for his calls directly, as the costs of ITS direct-dialed calls are
generally less expensive than operator-assisted collect calls. This commenter reported that his family had experienced
serious difficulties because of the large telephone bills from collect calls and stated that ``[a]t the time, I had
money in my commissary account. Not enough money to pay for the calls at the extremely high collect call rates, but certainly
enough to pay for them at dialing direct rates.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Charging a flat rate. Some commenters objected to the flat rates charged for ITS direct-dialed calls. Inmate comments
discussed taking advantage of discounts offered by various telephone service companies. One commenter, a telephone
service company, claimed that the proposed rule provided insufficient information to determine how the Bureau will
support the billing configuration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule has no impact on the type of service necessary to support the ITS. As currently designed, local telephone
calls placed on the ITS use telephone services provided by the local telephone company. Domestic long distance telephone
calls are placed on the U.S. Government's FTS2000 network. The FTS2000 network is a telephone service provided through
a contract between the General Services Administration and U.S. Sprint. The Bureau is an authorized user of the FTS2000
network. The FTS2000 network offers no time of day or day of week discounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A correctional institution is a unique environment. Unlike the general public, inmates have limited control over
when they may gain access to a telephone. It is therefore desirable for correctional management reasons to provide
all inmates with the same rate, regardless of what time they might be able to access a telephone. In addition, a flat
rate helps manage use of the telephone, since there is no longer any advantage to placing a call at a certain time of day.
This helps to reduce tensions between inmates during the evening, when, under the former collect call system, rates
are lowest. Inmates can also anticipate their cost for the call, regardless of when they may have the opportunity to
place the call.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The charge to the inmates for the use of the ITS is designed to cover the costs of the ITS, including the cost of the telephone
service, the salaries of employees hired to maintain the system, the cost of the lease and maintenance of the ITS software
and equipment (excluding recording equipment), and the cost of any necessary supplies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most cases, the resulting flat rate for direct-dialed calls placed on the ITS is considerably less expensive than
the same collect calls, even before taxes are added to the collect call costs. For example, from the institution where
the majority of inmate comments on this rule originated, a seven-minute collect local call costs $1.25. The same local
call, if direct-dialed on the ITS, would cost $.50, a savings of $.75.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar savings are evident on costs of long-distance calls. For example, again from the institution confining the
majority of inmates who submitted comments, a seven-minute collect long-distance call to New York City costs $3.62
in the daytime, $3.06 in the evening, and $2.92 on the weekend. The ITS cost for the same call, regardless of time or day,
is $1.75, $1.17 less than the lowest available collect call rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some inmate commenters compared ITS rates with costs of telephone calls available in the industry through local carrier
discounts, etc. The Bureau reminds these commenters that such discounts are not available in Bureau institutions
and therefore, it is more appropriate to compare the ITS rates to the collect call rates rather than to these discounted
rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. International calls. Some inmate commenters acknowledged that they were unable to make collect calls to their
families in certain foreign countries. One commenter complained, however, that it costs more to place ITS international
calls, specifically to Norway and Colombia. This commenter apparently does not dispute the fact that ITS calls to
these countries are generally less expensive than collect calls. Rather, the commenter's complaint was based upon
speculated costs for discount direct-dialed services not available to inmates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the only true comparison that can be made is between the costs of collect calls and ITS direct-dialed
calls. These comparisons easily support the Bureau's belief that ITS calls are generally less expensive. A recent
survey comparing the costs of ITS calls and the costs of collect calls from three institutions to several countries,
including Norway and Colombia, supports the Bureau's position that the ITS calls are generally less expensive than
collect international calls.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Inmates without funds. Several commenters stated that the proposed rule was unfair to indigent inmates, that these
telephone regulations discriminate against inmates who do not have much money, and that they preferred the use of
collect calls. However, neither the amended regulations, nor the ITS, prevent inmates' friends and family members
who would accept collect calls from sending money to defray the expense of the direct-dial calls. Thus, under both
the former collect call system and the new ITS debit billing system, an inmate claiming indigency is dependent upon
someone else to pay for the inmate's telephone calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau believes that even inmates with limited financial resources need to develop budgeting skills and to accept
personal responsibility for their actions. It is therefore appropriate to require these inmates to pay for some of
their telephone calls. However, to ensure that such inmates are able to make telephone calls, the Bureau has amended
the proposed rule to permit inmates without funds to make collect calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The phrase ``inmate without funds'' is defined as an inmate who has not had a trust fund account balance of $6.00 for
the past 30 days. See 28 CFR &sect;540.105(b). The $6.00 ceiling was selected because it is above the maintenance pay
level. Maintenance pay, which is currently $5.25 per month, is the lowest pay grade for inmates at Bureau institutions.
By defining ``inmates without funds'' as an inmate who has not had a trust fund account balance for the past 30 days of
$6.00, the regulations ensure that inmates who are in the lowest pay grade and who lack outside sources of income will
be able to make some collect telephone calls. The Bureau believes this standard is fairer and easier to apply uniformly
than an unspecified ``indigency'' standard, which would be subject to discretionary interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau has modified its telephone regulations to more clearly address the issue of telephone access for inmates
without funds. As stated in the proposed rule, the Warden may direct the government to bear the expenses of inmate telephone
use under compelling circumstances. In addition, the Bureau has added a new section to the final rule to allow inmates
without funds to make some collect telephone calls. See 28 CFR &sect;540.105(b). As revised, the final rule provides
a collect call every month and allows the Warden discretion to provide greater access based upon local conditions,
e.g., size of population, staff resources, usage demand. Implementing instructions to this provision recommend
that an inmate without funds be provided approximately 30 minutes of collect calling capability each month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is noteworthy that a commenter, in discussing international calls, indicates that where she was unable to place
collect calls because such calls were not processed by the telephone companies, the Bureau placed, and paid for, the
call. This acknowledgement clearly demonstrates the Bureau's commitment to provide telephone access for needy
inmates. In those instances, the compelling circumstance was created by the difficulties in placing such calls (e.g.,
some non-citizen inmate commenters reported their countries would not accept collect calls). In implementing the
ITS, which provides for direct-dialed international calls, the Bureau is thus in a better position to commit its financial
resources to those instances where the inmate is truly lacking in funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One inmate noted that the Bureau refused to pay for a telephone call to a foreign country that did not accept collect
calls. As noted above, the Bureau is committed to making reasonable accommodations by assuming payment for a limited
number of telephone calls in cases of compelling circumstances, such as when the inmate has lost contact with his family.
That was not the case in the commenter's situation, as this commenter did acknowledge the existence of telephone contact
with family members in this country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In closing the Bureau's response to comments relating to costs, we note the Bureau has also decided to further amend
28 CFR &sect;540.100 to provide for an inmate who has not been restricted from telephone use as the result of an institution
disciplinary action to make at least one telephone call each month. The existing rule provides for at least one call
every three months. The Bureau believes this change helps to further ensure an inmate has an opportunity for telephone
communications consistent with correctional management objectives.

8. Privacy Act Concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments expressed concern that in operating the ITS the Bureau's collection, maintenance, and use of information
about potential recipients of inmate telephone calls violates the recipients' statutory rights to privacy under
the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Some commenters objected to what they perceive as the Bureau's alleged use of information
on inmate visiting lists to create or compile telephone lists.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended regulations do not contemplate the Bureau's use of visiting lists as the source of names or numbers for
use on inmate telephone lists. The final rule states, instead, that inmates are to provide information for the creation
and maintenance of their telephone lists. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These nonincarcerated individuals also objected to the Bureau's obtaining information about them from the telephone
lists submitted by the inmates. The Privacy Act provides in relevant part that, ``to the extent practicable,'' an
agency shall collect information directly from an individual about whom the agency may make ``adverse determinations.''
5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2). It is far more practicable to collect up to 30 names and telephone numbers from a single inmate
than it is to collect them from each recipient of that inmate's calls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also expressed concern about the form addressed to potential recipients of an inmate's calls on the ground
that the form seeks information about those individuals which they allege to be private information. As discussed
above in the section entitled ``3. CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* b. Fourth Amendment rights
to privacy.'', the Bureau has revised the final rule to eliminate this form, and replaced it with a notice letter to
potential recipients who are not immediate family or persons already approved for the inmate's visiting list. This
change should substantially accommodate comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

9. Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the previous issues, comments received by the Bureau raised several other issues, and are addressed
below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. One commenter, a telephone service company, perceived a potential for conflict between the proposed rule and potential
orders and rules that may be issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) arising out of the currently pending
Billed Party Preference docket (BPP). The Bureau believes that it is not necessary to respond to comments based upon
``potential problems''. Accordingly, if the FCC or any other agency issues regulations in the future which conflict
with these telephone regulations, the Bureau will take appropriate action at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Commenters objected to the ITS stating that it was arbitrary and that its current use violates 28 CFR parts 540 and
545. For the reasons discussed above, there are valid correctional management reasons for amending the regulations
to provide for the operation of the ITS. We do not consider these regulations to be arbitrary, as the ITS is being implemented
following a pilot program and an assessment that it better addresses the Bureau's correctional goals and institution
security needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the IFRP provision, the Bureau believes that the discussion above sufficiently addresses this comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A commenter wanted assurance that there would be no harrassment or punitive actions based on inmate objection to
the ITS implementation. Bureau staff are professionals and are provided training on their role and responsibilities.
Staff retaliation against inmates is not tolerated. The Bureau's Office of Internal Affairs and the Inspector General
of the Department of Justice will thoroughly investigate any allegations of misconduct. The Bureau's Chief Executive
Officers will take appropriate action where indicated. The Administrative Remedy Program is another vehicle available
to inmates to raise allegations of staff misconduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Commenters stated that it would be an additional financial hardship to have people send money. The basis for this
complaint is not entirely clear in one comment; in a second comment, the commenter refers to the family sending money
for hygiene items and that to require money for telephone use would pose an additional financial burden. As noted earlier,
the Bureau does provide for basic hygiene items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters were concerned that it may be necessary to exchange foreign currency prior to residents of a foreign
country forwarding any funds, with some stating that their country does not allow its currency to leave the country.
As noted above, the lower ITS rates should provide some relief for such incidental costs as exchange fees, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. A commenter mistakenly believes that loss of commissary privileges as a result of disciplinary action will also
result in the loss of telephone privileges. This is not the case. As with postage stamp purchases, telephone access
is independent of the regular commissary. For an inmate to lose telephone privileges as a result of disciplinary action,
that sanction must be specifically stated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
f. A commenter objected to the proposed rule not being posted in the prisons within a timely manner. It is Bureau policy
to post proposed rules in its institutions to facilitate inmate comments. The date of posting is often dictated, in
part, by when we receive the requisite copies of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and by mailing time. On occasion, delays can result from this process. To accommodate this commenter's concerns,
the Bureau plans to extend (ordinarily to 60 days) the time for public comment on future Bureau rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. A commenter favors letting each person who receives a call decide whether to accept or reject that call, without
sending money. In response, the Bureau first notes that there is no requirement for an outside person to forward the
inmate funds. As already discussed, the Bureau believes that there are strong correctional management reasons for
restricting collect telephone calls and for providing that inmates should ordinarily pay for their telephone calls.
Certainly, where the need exists, and as set forth in the rule, the Bureau will provide collect call capability or,
in the alternative, pay for the call itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each potential recipient of a call has the option of refusing consent to be maintained on the inmate's telephone list.
Even if an individual elects to remain on the inmate's telephone list, he or she can use other means, such as an answering
machine or other services provided by local telephone carriers (caller ID, for example), to screen incoming calls,
or simply hang up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. One inmate commenter alleged that the Bureau transferred inmates to institutions far removed from anticipated
release areas in violation of Bureau designation practice, resulting in reduced opportunity for visits and higher
costs for telephone communications. This commenter recommended that a certain number of free telephone calls be
provided to any inmate located 500 miles or more from a home city. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general policy, the Bureau strives to locate inmates in institutions consistent with their security needs within
reasonable proximity to a release residence. However, the Bureau's designation policy also allows for exceptions
to be made, based upon management variables, e.g., institution capacity and individual inmate security needs. The
generally lower flat rate fees for ITS calls should benefit such inmates. The regulations already contain provisions
for the placement of collect calls or for calls at government expense in cases of compelling circumstances. See 28
CFR 540.105(d). The Bureau therefore finds no reason to adopt this commenter's recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. One inmate commenter objected to the proposed rule, claiming that the telephone installed in her housing unit was
not accessible to wheelchair-bound or visually-impaired inmates. The Bureau assures this commenter that it is Bureau
policy to make every institution accessible to disabled inmates, including the use of telephone equipment. Institution
staff have now resolved this commenter's problem by adjusting the telephone location to permit access by the disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau notes that another commenter claiming various disabilities, visual and psychological, raised no objection
to accessibility. As noted above, the Bureau is committed to making reasonable accommodations to meet the needs of
all disabled inmates in providing telephone access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Commenters objected that the proposed rule did not define terms such as ``emergency'' or ``rehabilitative goals.''
A commenter claimed that staff was not available to inmates on a twenty-four hour a day, seven-days a week basis. The
Bureau wishes to assure this commenter that every Bureau facility is staffed on a twenty-four hour a day, seven-day
a week basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for a definition of rehabilitative goals, the final rule does not include the term rehabilitation as a grounds for
rejection of a telephone number from an inmate's telephone list. The Bureau notes, however, that while rehabilitation
remains an important goal for the Bureau's management of inmates, a specific definition cannot be given because each
situation is characterized by the facts and circumstances existing for a particular inmate. For example, an inmate's
unit team will work with the inmate concerning areas of interest to that inmate in preparation for the inmate's own
self-improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the definition of an emergency, this also must be predicated on the given situation, e.g., loss of contact with
the family or death of a family member. See 28 CFR 540.101(e) and 540.105(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. A commenter related an incident where she placed a collect call to a Senator's office from an institution where the
ITS is not yet available and was asked for a return number, which she provided. The commenter alleged that she never
received a return call and was subsequently informed by institution staff that she should no longer call the Senator's
office collect. We are unable to address this complaint as it is unrelated to the proposed rule and is more properly
addressed through the Administrative Remedy Program discussed previously. However, we note that, under the amended
regulations, inmates may choose to submit telephone numbers for Senators and other elected officials on their telephone
lists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. A commenter objected that the proposed rule was unfair to inmates who were medically idle (i.e., unable to participate
in a work assignment because of a medical condition). If a medically idle inmate is also an ``inmate without funds,''
as defined herein, then the final rule accommodates this comment, because all inmates without funds may make some
collect calls or have the Bureau pay for the call in a compelling circumstance. See 28 CFR 540.105(b) and 540.105(d)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. Former &sect;540.105 is removed because its provisions are now incorporated in other portions of the final rule
or are no longer necessary, due to changes in the Bureau's discipline policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of Executive
Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed by OMB pursuant to Executive Order 12866. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as part of its overall correctional management.
Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of maintaining community and family ties that will contribute to an
inmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a person of his or her choice outside the institution
on a telephone provided for that purpose. However, limitations and conditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone
privileges to ensure that these are consistent with other aspects of the Bureau's correctional management responsibilities.
In addition to the procedures set forth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those limitations set forth
under the inmate financial responsibility program (see 28 CFR 545.11) and those which the Warden determines are necessary
to ensure the security or good order, including discipline, of the institution or to protect the public. Restrictions
on inmate telephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction (see 28 CFR part 541).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Telephone list preparation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An inmate telephone call shall ordinarily be made to a number identified on the inmate's official telephone list.
This list ordinarily may contain up to 30 numbers. The Associate Warden may authorize the placement of additional
numbers on an inmate's telephone list based on the inmate's individual situation, e.g., size of family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) During the admission and orientation process, an inmate who chooses to have telephone privileges shall prepare
a proposed telephone list. At the time of submission, the inmate shall acknowledge that, to the best of the inmate's
knowledge, the person or persons on the list are agreeable to receiving the inmate's telephone call and that the proposed
calls are to be made for a purpose allowable under Bureau policy or institution guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, telephone numbers requested by an inmate will ordinarily
be placed on the inmate's telephone list. When an inmate requests the placement of numbers for persons other than for
immediate family or those persons already approved for the inmate's visiting list, staff ordinarily will notify
those persons in writing that their numbers have been placed on the inmate's telephone list. The notice advises the
recipient that the recipient's number will be removed from the list if the recipient makes a written request to the
institution, or upon the written request of the inmate, or as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Associate Warden may deny placement of a telephone number on an inmate's telephone list if the Associate Warden
determines that there is a threat to institution security or good order, or a threat to the public. Any disapproval
must be documented in writing to both the inmate and the proposed recipient. As with concerns about any correctional
issue, including any portion of these telephone regulations, an inmate may appeal the denial through the administrative
remedy procedure (see 28 CFR part 542). The Associate Warden will notify the denied recipient that he or she may appeal
the denial by writing to the Warden within 15 days of the receipt of the denial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Telephone list update. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each Warden shall establish procedures to allow an inmate the opportunity to submit telephone list changes on at least
a quarterly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Telephone access codes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An inmate may not possess another inmate's telephone access code number. An inmate may not give his or her telephone
access code number to another inmate, and is to report a compromised telephone access code number immediately to unit
staff.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Placement and duration of telephone call. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The placement and duration of any telephone call is subject to availability of inmate funds. Ordinarily, an inmate
who has sufficient funds is allowed at least three minutes for a telephone call. The Warden may limit the maximum length
of telephone calling based on the situation at that institution (e.g., institution population or usage demand).

(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Warden may allow the placement of collect calls for good cause. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited
to, inmates who are new arrivals to the institution, including new commitments and transfers; inmates confined at
Metropolitan Correctional Centers, Metropolitan Detention Centers, or Federal Detention Centers; pretrial inmates;
inmates in holdover status; inmates who are without funds (see &sect;540.105(b)); and in cases of family emergencies.

Expenses of inmate telephone use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An inmate is responsible for the expenses of inmate telephone use. Such expenses may include a fee for replacement
of an inmate's telephone access code that is used in an institution which has implemented debit billing for inmate
telephone calls. Each inmate is responsible for staying aware of his or her account balance through the automated
process provided by the system. Third party billing and electronic transfer of a call to a third party are prohibited.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Warden shall provide at least one collect call each month for an inmate who is without funds. An inmate without
funds is defined as an inmate who has not had a trust fund account balance of $6.00 for the past 30 days. The Warden may
increase the number of collect calls based upon local institution conditions (e.g., institution population, staff
resources, and usage demand). To prevent abuses of this provision (e.g., inmate shows a pattern of depleting his or
her commissary funds prior to placing collect calls), the Warden may impose restrictions on the provisions of this
paragraph (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Warden shall limit the telephone privileges (collect and debit billed calls) of an inmate who has refused to
participate in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP) as specified in 28 CFR part 545. (Effective date
of this paragraph (&sect;540.105(c)) is delayed until January 3, 1995.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Warden may direct the government to bear the expense of inmate telephone use or allow a call to be made collect
under compelling circumstances such as when an inmate has lost contact with his family or has a family emergency.

(b) *&blank;*&blank;* In developing an inmate's financial plan, the unit team shall exclude from its assessment
$50 a month deposited into the inmate's trust fund account. This $50 exemption shall be calculated after subtracting
from the trust fund account the inmate's IFRP minimum payment schedule for UNICOR or non-UNICOR work assignments,
set forth below in paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. This $50.00 is excluded to allow the inmate the opportunity
to better maintain telephone communication under the Inmate Telephone System (ITS).

Any exception to this provision requires approval of the Warden, and is to be based on compelling circumstances. (Effective
