SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule was issued as amendments to regulations governing Cotton Classification Services for Producers
(7 CFR part 28). The proposal was issued on January 31, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 4257). It proposed the implementation of module averaging, a method by which the accuracy of fiber quality measurements
can be improved. The module averaging procedure would use all the bales from a module or trailer as the testing unit
rather than using a single bale as the test unit. The module averaging procedure has been offered to growers on a voluntary
basis for the past three crop years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Agriculture's Advisory Committee on Cotton Marketing recommended that if no significant problems
were encountered during the 1993 classing season, the module averaging procedure be expanded to include all cotton
classed in 1994 and subsequent crop years. For the 1993 expanded voluntary program, there were 242 gins participating
and the production from these gins totaled 3,053,716 bales. This represented 20 percent of the 1993 cotton crop. No
problems of any significance are known to have developed during the 1993 project. In keeping with the advisory committee's
recommendation, AMS proposed that module averaging be applied to all bales classed effective with the 1994 cotton
crop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments regarding this proposal were accepted from January 31, 1994, through March 2, 1994. Comments were
received from individuals and organizations representing several segments of the cotton industry including producers,
ginners, warehousers, merchants, cooperatives, national and international trade associations, textile manufacturers,
and others. This broad cross section of the cotton industry, together with a significant number of comments (61) indicates
a strong interest in the module averaging concept throughout the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The textile manufacturing segment submitted four comments; one from a national organization representing domestic
textile manufacturers, and three from individual firms. All of these comments expressed support for the proposal.
The national organization representing textile manufacturers favored the implementation of the proposal provided
four conditions were met: (1) That at least two tests per bale be made; (2) that the integrity of the module be maintained
by preventing the intermingling of cotton between module test units; (3) that when the module averaging procedure
is used only those measurements that fall within three standard deviations of the average be included in the module
average; and (4) that for the purposes of review classification, all bales from the module be retested. The remaining
three comments all reiterated the suggestion for the use of three standard deviations as a determination for including
bales in the module average. The Agency is currently, and will continue, studying how best to determine the inclusion
or exclusion of bales from the module average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirteen comments were received from the producer segment, including two from national organizations. One national
organization was in favor of the proposal. The other recommended the delay of mandatory implementation until 1995,
and the application of module averaging to length, strength and micronaire measurements only. The remaining comments,
submitted by regional producer organizations and individual producers, were nearly equally divided among those
favoring the proposal and those supporting the module averaging concept, but suggesting the continuation of the
voluntary program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cotton ginning segment, through national and state organizations, and individual ginners, submitted 14 written
comments. The national organization representing cotton ginners encouraged the comprehensive industry review
of the 1993 and 1994 module averaging results and continuation of the voluntary module averaging program. The remaining
comments expressed general support for the module averaging concept but suggested that module averaging be continued
on a voluntary basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A leading national association representing cotton merchants, shippers and exporters of raw cotton opposed the
mandatory implementation of module averaging while supporting the continuation of the voluntary program. The Agency
is currently responding to a separate request from this organization for statistical data pertaining to module averaged
cotton. This organization maintains that further evaluation of the data is necessary prior to the implementation
of mandatory module averaging. The remaining 22 comments received from the merchant segment also requested that
module averaging be continued on a voluntary basis so that the effects of module averaging on cotton marketing can
be further evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three foreign cotton trade organizations submitted comments. These comments all stated that the international
cotton trade was not yet sufficiently knowledgeable about the module averaging concept to favor its use on anything
more than a voluntary basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the views expressed in comments submitted from the various segments of the cotton industry, the Agency
has determined that it is in the public interest to continue with the module averaging program on a voluntary basis.
Such action will provide the cotton industry more time to evaluate the effects of module averaging on cotton marketing.
Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn effective April 5, 1994.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to clarify and update the voluntary shell egg grading regulations
and standards in response to new technology and current practices in the shell egg industry and to conform to statutory
requirements. The proposed revisions would amend existing regulations to define washed ungraded eggs and clarify
the definition of a quality assurance inspector. The proposal would add age and disability as types of prohibited
discrimination in providing grading services. Additionally, the proposal would clarify the type of facilities
and equipment to be supplied to a grader and the method by which cartons of eggs are to be identified. Further revisions
would update grading room requirements to include mechanized shell egg operations and to require rinse water to be
at least as warm as wash water. In addition, the standards for quality of individual shell eggs for B quality in U.S.
Nest-Run grades would be harmonized with the U.S. Standards for Quality of Individual Shell Eggs for B quality, and
the wholesale shell egg grades and weight classes would be deleted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMS Administrator has determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), because the revisions reflect current industry production and marketing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements that appear in &sect;56.17(b) and &sect;56.37 to be amended by the proposed
rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581&hyph;0128,
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Periodically the Poultry Division of AMS reviews its existing regulations. As a result of a review, it was determined
that several revisions were necessary to make the shell egg standards and regulations for grading shell eggs more
useful and efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grading of shell eggs by the AMS is a voluntary program, provided under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946,
as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and is offered on a fee-for-service basis. The grading program is designed to assist orderly marketing of shell
eggs. Therefore, the standards must keep abreast of new technology and advancements in production and marketing
practices.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reflect these changes, the Agency is proposing to amend the Regulations Governing the Grading of Shell Eggs and
the U.S. Standards, Grades, and Weight Classes for Shell Eggs in 7 CFR part 56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would redefine ``quality assurance inspector'' to exclude from this designation a plant owner, manager,
foreman, or supervisor and to clarify that the quality assurance inspector is authorized to examine product. The
revision is necessary to eliminate the possibility that someone with a financial interest in the product or having
managerial responsibilities would be designated as a quality assurance inspector. The revision also would clarify
that examining or sampling product is a primary responsibility required of a quality assurance inspector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also define the term ``washed ungraded eggs'' to mean shell eggs which have been washed but not subject
to any grading or segregation for quality. This addition is necessary to facilitate the trading, certification,
and identification of shell eggs from processing facilities where shell eggs move continuously from laying house
to processing facilities without being graded. Such shell eggs cannot be classified as nest run eggs because they
have been washed and are not intended for consumer sales because they have not been graded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would update the regulations to comply with current statutory requirements regarding providing grading
services and licensing graders without discrimination due to age or disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facilities and equipment which the applicant furnishes the grader would be revised to include other facilities
and equipment as may otherwise be required. As new equipment has been developed and installed in official plants,
additional items have been required to perform normal grading activities. The proposal would specifically require
the applicant to provide any adequate facilities and equipment necessary to perform grading activities as changes
in technology and production practices dictate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would revise the regulations to comply with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, which requires
nutrition labeling on most foods that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would revise the existing method of identifying cartons to require that each officially identified
carton of shell eggs be lot numbered on either the carton or the consumer package. The current regulations specify
that the cartons shall be lot numbered on the carton or the tape used to seal the carton. The shell egg industry does not
use tape to seal cartons in their current production practices. This revision would update the regulations to reflect
current production practices and in addition provide flexibility to accommodate future changes that the industry
may devise for officially identifying shell eggs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposal would revise the minimum facility and operating requirements for shell egg grading and
packing plants by updating grading room requirements. The current regulations describe hand-candling operations
which are out-of date because almost all shell egg processing is done mechanically. Regulations are needed which
define the grading room requirements of a mechanized shell egg processing operation. The proposed revision will
specifically define the requirements of a mechanized shell egg operation while providing the flexibility to approve
the acceptability of all grading rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shell egg cleaning operations also would be revised to require that the temperature of the water used to spray rinse
shell eggs be at least as warm as the water used to wash the shell eggs. The current regulations require that washed shell
eggs be spray rinsed with warm water. This revision would specify that ``warm'' means at least the temperature of the
water used to wash the shell eggs and would also bring the regulations in line with current washing and sanitizing practices
which help reduce bacterial contamination of shell eggs. If shell eggs are subjected to a sanitizing spray rinse which
is colder than the water used to wash them, the probability of bacterial contamination increases because the cold
water causes the shell contents to contract which allows contaminants to be drawn through the shell of the egg. Additionally,
the revisions would specifically authorize the National Supervisor to approve methods of sanitizing shell eggs
other than the normal spray rinse method. This revision will provide the flexibility to accommodate future changes
in the technology of sanitizing shell eggs and to adapt to new waste management requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to delete U.S. Wholesale Grades and Weight Classes for Shell Eggs. This is necessary because
wholesale grades are difficult to understand and are virtually unused. Almost all shell eggs moving in commerce today
are sold on the basis of the U.S. Consumer Grades, U.S. Nest-Run Grades, company approved specifications, or sold
without certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to revise the existing standards for B quality in U.S. Nest-Run Grades for shell eggs by allowing
shell eggs with pronounced ridges and thin spots to be included in the maximum percentage tolerance permitted for
B quality. The standard for B quality currently defines abnormal in part as exhibiting pronounced ridges and thin
spots. The proposed revision would provide uniformity between the B quality description for U.S. Nest-Run Grades
and the standards for B quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 4, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Energy Efficiency Standards for eight
appliance types (59 FR 10464). As part of the analysis supporting that Notice, the Department prepared an Environmental
Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0819), which was printed within Volume I of the Technical Support Document that was prepared
for that rulemaking proposal. Today's action makes publically available the Finding of No Significant Impact that
had been prepared for that Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. It is printed in its entirety.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, the National Appliance
Energy Conservation Act of 1987, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, prescribes
energy conservation standards for certain major household appliances, and requires the Department of Energy (DOE)
to administer an energy conservation program for these products. Based on an Environmental Assessment (EA), DOE/EA&hyph;0819,
DOE has determined that the proposal of any of the candidate amended energy efficiency standards for the eight appliances
would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Therefore, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is not
required, and the Department is issuing this finding of no significant impact (FONSI).

Description of the Proposed Action:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed action is the establishment of revised energy conservation standards for room air conditioners, water
heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters and fluorescent
lamp ballasts, and to consider standards for televisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental Impacts:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EA evaluates the environmental impacts of a range of new candidate energy conservation standards for eight types
of household appliances. The results are presented for each potential standard level for each of the eight appliance
types. Each potential standard level is an alternative action, and the environmental impacts of each alternative
are compared to what would be expected to happen if no new standards for each product were finalized, i.e., the ``no
action'' alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main environmental concern is emissions from fossil-fueled electricity generation. Most of the design options
for the eight appliances would result in decreased electricity use and, therefore, a reduction of power plant emissions.
The proposed efficiency standards would generally decrease air pollution by decreasing future energy demand. The
greatest decreases in air pollution would be for sulfur oxides, listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or
SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, respectively. Design options for many of the appliances (i.e., gas and oil water heaters, gas pool heaters, direct
heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, and gas ranges and ovens) would also reduce in-home fuel consumption, resulting
in lower in-home emissions from fuel-burning appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the quantity of raw materials used per appliance would remain relatively constant, in most scenarios increased
initial prices from standards are expected to reduce slightly the number of appliances sold, which would result in
small decreases in the total amount of raw materials used. The main effect of this decreased appliance production
would be the SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 decreases from avoided fuel burning at power plants. The environmental contribution from reduced steel production
is not included in the estimates for net SO

, any reduction would possibly be beneficial to the quality of surface water. Since the total amount of particulates
emitted would decrease, it is very likely that fewer particulates would reach the surface water.

 would have other beneficial effects on the environment. The resultant improvement to air quality and the decreased
potential for acid rain formation could help improve the quality of wetlands and fish and wildlife as well as aid in
the preservation of historical and archaeological sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduced in-home fuel consumption of gas or oil would decrease the impact of combustion on indoor air quality. Indoor
air problems are usually due to a combination of factors, including a tight house envelope, insufficient ventilation
for cooking appliances, presence of sources such as cigarette smokers or formaldehyde-containing products, and
radon diffusion from soil. In comparison to the above factors, and because fuel-burning appliances are normally
vented to the outside, the projected changes in home fuel-burning appliance use is expected to have little effect
on indoor air quality.

Determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based upon the EA, DOE has determined that the proposal of any of the candidate amended energy-efficiency standards
for room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens,
pool heaters, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets would not consitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of NEPA. Therefore, an EIS for the proposed action
is not required.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC is proposing to rescind section 304.6 of its regulations, which currently requires all insured banks, with
the exception of insured bankers' banks, to give the FDIC prior notice of planned rapid growth as a result of any ``special
funding plan or arrangement.'' For purposes of this requirement, such a funding plan is an effort to increase the assets
of a bank through the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation
of brokers or affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits); the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside
a bank's normal trade area; or secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rescission would lessen the regulatory burden on banks which are currently required to comply as well
with the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action rule, both of which were designed in
part to address the same risks resulting from rapid growth. The brokered deposit regulation was mandated by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and amended to conform to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The prompt corrective action rule was mandated by FDICIA.
The rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, but was authorized by the FDIC's general regulatory powers.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although rapid growth is not necessarily an indicator of unsafe or unsound banking practices, and many banks have
been able to manage rapid growth safely, rapid growth does present special risks to a bank (and to the FDIC's insurance
fund). Because these risks warrant special monitoring, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring advance notice to the FDIC
of planned rapid growth. That provision of the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR 304.6, known as ``the rapid growth rule,''
states that an insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets
by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC
regional director for supervision in writing at least 30 days before the implementation of the special funding plan
or arrangement. A special funding plan or arrangement is defined as any effort to increase the assets of a bank through
(1) the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or
affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits), (2) the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's
normal trade area (depending upon the circumstances, these may be insured brokered deposits) or (3) secured borrowings,
including repurchase agreements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In regulating rapid growth, the rapid growth rule in part overlaps both the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation, 12
CFR 337.6, and its prompt corrective action regulation, 12 CFR 308.200 ff. and 325.101 ff. Should the rapid growth
rule be rescinded, the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations will be the principal means by which
rapid growth will be regulated. For this reason, in deciding whether to rescind the rapid growth rule, the FDIC examined
the rationale and history behind all three regulations, to see if the FDIC's safety-and-soundness concerns will
be met even if the rapid growth rule is rescinded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rapid growth rule, adopted in 1990, replaced a regulation that called for the reporting of fully insured brokered
deposits and fully insured deposits placed directly by other depository institutions. In the preamble to the proposed
rapid growth rule, the FDIC stated that its intention was to broaden the prior regulation's focus from brokered deposits
to all kinds of rapid growth, including brokered deposits:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a bank may obtain its funding from a variety of sources in addition to brokered deposits, the FDIC believes that
any effort to monitor and control rapid growth in insured banks should not focus solely or even principally on brokered
deposits. Instead, the focus should be on rapid growth 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
as an indication of the need for close monitoring and supervisory oversight.

54 FR 13693, April 5, 1989. The proposed rapid growth rule stated that:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
an insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets by more than
nine percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC regional director
for supervision in writing at least 30 days in advance of the implementation of the special funding plan or arrangement.
For purposes of this requirement, a special funding plan or arrangement is any effort to rapidly increase the assets
of the bank by any means.

at 13695. The final rule changed the nine percent to 7.5 percent, making the rule more stringent in that respect, but
it narrowed the scope of the rule by making the notice necessary only if there was 7.5 percent growth resulting from
one or more of the following activities: (1) The solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from
or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits); (2) the solicitation of fully
insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area (this category would include insured brokered deposits); or
(3) secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. Thus, while it is not the sole aim of the rapid growth rule
to curb the rapid growth that may result from the acceptance of brokered deposits, controlling a bank's acceptance
of brokered deposits is one of the primary aims of that rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, the history of the present brokered deposit regulation
involves two statutes, FIRREA and FDICIA. In 1989, FIRREA amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), prohibiting
an undercapitalized institution from accepting funds obtained, directly or indirectly, by or through any deposit
broker for deposit into one or more deposit accounts except upon specific application to, and waiver of the prohibition
by, the FDIC. Section 224 of FIRREA, adding section 29 to the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831f. In addition to deposits obtained
through the mediation of third-party brokers, the definition of ``brokered deposits'' included deposits on which
an institution offers or has agreed to pay rates of interest that are ``significantly'' higher than the prevailing
rates of interest offered by other depository institutions with the same type of charter in the first institution's
normal market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two years later, the FDI Act was amended again. This time, FDICIA rewrote section 29 of the Act to restrict the acceptance
of brokered deposits by certain institutions on the basis of their capital levels. Section 301 of FDICIA, amending
section 29 of the FDI Act and adding section 29A thereto, 12 U.S.C. 1831f, 1831f-1. According to FDICIA and the brokered
deposit regulation implementing it, 12 CFR 337.6, undercapitalized institutions may not accept brokered deposits
at all, and adequately capitalized institutions must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before they can accept brokered
deposits. Further, FDICIA limits the interest rates which adequately capitalized institutions can pay on brokered
deposits. Well-capitalized insured depository institutions, however, can accept, renew or roll over brokered
deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC, and without being limited in the interest rates they can pay.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these restrictions on brokered deposits, FDICIA also established a comprehensive regulatory scheme
for insured depository institutions based on their capital levels. Section 131 of FDICIA, adding section 38 to the
FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831o. Under the ``prompt corrective action'' provisions of FDICIA, the statute places severe
constraints on what undercapitalized institutions can do, including severe restrictions on asset growth. As explained
in the regulation which implements section 131 of FDICIA, 12 CFR 308.200 ff. and 325.101 ff., and which took effect
on December 19, 1992, as soon as a bank receives notice, or is deemed to have received notice, that it is undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, the bank must restrict the growth of its assets
as set forth in section 38(e)(3) of the FDI Act. That section of the Act states that an undercapitalized insured depository
institution shall not permit its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets
during the preceding calendar quarter unless: (1) The appropriate Federal banking agency has accepted the institution's
capital restoration plan; (2) any increase in total assets is consistent with the plan; and (3) the institution's
ratio of tangible equity to assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable the institution
to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time. 12 U.S.C. 1831o(e)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the above statutes and regulations, the FDIC is considering whether there is a continuing need for the rapid
growth rule. Under the rule, the FDIC, upon being informed by a bank that it is about to undergo rapid growth, can engage
the institution in a dialog as to whether such growth would be prudent and should be pursued. Under the brokered deposit
and prompt corrective action regulations, restrictions on brokered deposits and rapid growth attach automatically
to certain banks having an insufficient capital level. Thus, although the rapid growth rule operates somewhat differently
from the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, the rapid growth rule may no longer be necessary
given the existence of those other two regulations. For this reason, the FDIC is proposing that the rapid growth rule
be rescinded. This action will ease the regulatory burden on those institutions now subject to all three rules. (If
the FDIC rescinds the rapid growth rule, 12 CFR 304.6, it will also rescind the line on the table in 12 CFR 304.7, which
pertains to the Office of Management and Budget's Control Number for the rapid growth rule.)

While the rapid growth rule overlaps the brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action regulation,
this overlap is only partial. For instance, rescinding the rapid growth rule would mean that an insured bank would
no longer have to notify the FDIC before it either solicited fully insured deposits outside its normal trade area,
or when it acquired secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, if one or a combination of both of these
activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month
period. And while a well-capitalized bank planning to accept brokered deposits on a large scale would no longer have
to inform the FDIC of this fact in advance once the rapid growth rule was rescinded, that bank still must report the amount
of brokered money it has accepted after the fact in its quarterly Report of Condition and Income (``call report'').
Also, deposit brokers must continue to register with the FDIC, and, if requested, could be required to provide data
on the extent of a given bank's brokered deposit activities, under the brokered deposit regulation. If the rapid growth
rule were rescinded, some of the rapid growth resulting from rapid growth rule activities would continue to be detected
by the FDIC's Growth Monitoring System (a system administered by the FDIC's Division of Supervision which identifies
rapid growth over a single quarter in assets or loans and long-term securities and any related deterioration in key
performance ratios), some rapid growth would be controlled or prohibited by the brokered deposit rule, and some would
be prohibited by the regulation on prompt corrective action, but a small part of rapid growth might not be controlled
or detected at all. Thus, comment is sought on whether the rescission of the rapid growth rule would create a regulatory
gap that would have harmful effects on banking.

The FDIC's Board of Directors has concluded that the proposed amendment, if adopted, will not impose a significant
economic hardship on small institutions. The proposal does not establish any recordkeeping or reporting requirements
that necessitate the expertise of specialized accountants, lawyers or managers. The proposal would, in fact, reduce
the reporting requirements to which banks are presently subject. Rescinding the rapid growth rule will afford some
insured banks the opportunity to conduct activities previously prohibited unless notice were given in accordance
with the rule (for instance, the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area, or the
acquisition of secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, such that one or a combination of both activities
were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC's Board of Directors therefore certifies pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
605) that the proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA is proposing to repeal its present media or opinion molder policy rule. Under the rule, as proposed, small business
concerns engaged in media activity would be eligible for SBA financial assistance unless they are otherwise ineligible
(such as businesses engaged in illegal activities or in activities that could not be funded by SBA under the Constitution,
and businesses which are not creditworthy). This action is being taken to enable SBA to promote job growth and economic
development by making SBA financial assistance available to a larger number of small business concerns.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
It is timely for the Agency to consider major substantive changes in the media policy rule. Under SBA's present regulatory
policy, no business loan may be made to an applicant engaged in the ``creation, origination, expression, dissemination,
propagation or distribution of ideas, values, thoughts, opinions or similar intellectual property, regardless
of medium, form or content.'' (13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(b) (1993)). There are several express exceptions to this prohibition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This policy was originally adopted by SBA in 1953 under the authority granted by section 4(d) of the Small Business
Act (15 U.S.C. 633(d)) which authorizes the Agency to ``establish general policies (particularly with reference
to the public interest *&blank;*&blank;*), which shall govern the granting and denial of applications for financial
assistance by the Administration.'' The Reconstruction Finance Agency, the predecessor to SBA, had a similar media
policy rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were three basic reasons for the policy: First, the prohibition is based upon SBA's desire to avoid any possible
accusation that the Government is attempting to control editorial freedom by subsidizing media or communication
for political or propaganda purposes. Second, the Agency has generally sought to avoid Government identification
through its business assistance programs with concerns which might publish or produce matters of a religious or controversial
nature. Third, SBA recognizes that the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech and press ought not
to be compromised either by the fear of Government reprisal or by the expectation of Government financial assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, Congress has considered the policy and has not objected to SBA's approach. In H.R. Rep. No. 840, 94th
Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1976), the Subcommittee on SBA Oversight and Minority Enterprise acknowledged that SBA's statutory
duty to assist small business ``must be in balance with supervening First Amendment prohibitions. The Subcommittee
does not believe that the SBA should engage in activities which would necessitate its assumption of a censorship role.
By censorship we mean the ability of SBA to direct a business as to what it can do or cannot do, relative to First Amendment
protected activity, coupled with the power to enforce its will through the use of sanctions. The subcommittee believes
such censorship would exist if SBA were to place in its loan agreements a prohibition against the promulgation of certain
ideas and values, a breach of which would allow the Agency to liquidate the loan.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many individual members of Congress have expressed concern with the substance of SBA's regulations in this area.
Several bills have been introduced to deal with the rule legislatively, although none has been enacted. For example,
S. 2084, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1984), would have abolished the rule except in cases where the financial assistance
would have been used primarily to (1) advance or inhibit religion; (2) threaten the overthrow of organized Government
by unlawful means; or (3) engage in any illegal activity or the dissemination of obscene materials which may be unlawful
in any jurisdiction in which the small concern may operate. S. 2084 also would have required SBA to look at the content
of the publications or communications in making its decision to assist a particular small concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H.R. 1157, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), would have required SBA to hold a hearing, if the business was covered by the
media policy rule, in order to ascertain if the SBA financial assistance would have been (1) adverse or detrimental
to a legitimate public interest, or (2) used primarily to promote or criticize political or religious ideas. This
approach would have led to lengthy hearings on applications for assistance every time the Agency interpreted the
law adversely to an applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA testified on both of these bills and supported a legislative remedy to the problems associated with administration
of the rule. However, no legislation has been forthcoming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In hearings on March 7, 1984, before the House Subcommittee on Export Opportunity and Special Small Business Problems,
which was considering H.R. 1157, an expert in Constitutional Law on the faculty of the George Washington University
Law School testified that the media policy rule was constitutional and was a justifiable approach in light of SBA's
business and financial orientation and limited First Amendment expertise. However, there have been concerns raised
over the years regarding the breadth of the present rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation presently provides a very broad list of ineligible enterprises which includes publishers, producers,
importers, exporters or distributors of all types of communications (such as newspapers, sheet music, posters,
film, tape, theatrical productions, greeting cards, and books), plus transportation concerns limited to the distribution
of such products. Regulatory exceptions have been granted to commercial printing firms, advertising agencies,
technical production facilities (such as a recording studio), and vocational schools. Eligible for assistance
based on administrative interpretations are general merchandise stores which sell books, magazines and newspapers,
and general book, music, record or videotape stores. Not eligible for assistance are specialty book or videotape
stores which sell or rent items in a single or limited subject area. The rationale underlying the distinction between
general and specialty stores has been that a general store covers a broad range of ideas, values and thoughts, rather
than a particular or narrow set of ideas or values. SBA no longer regards this distinction as a proper basis for determining
eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA is well aware that small media concerns often have difficulty in raising capital or borrowing money. The media
policy rule applicable to the financing of business loans has not been applicable to assistance provided by small
business investment companies (SBICs) which are licensed by SBA. Thus, SBICs are permitted to help businesses engaged
in the media. The policy surrounding SBIC assistance to media concerns is similar to the approach taken by the Congress
in funding broadcasting through the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting. SBICs operate within SBA regulations,
but their transactions with small companies are private arrangements which carry no SBA guaranty. Their funding
comes from private, SBA and other nonprivate sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA also has been making physical injury disaster loans to media concerns and academic schools since 1953, based on
humanitarian grounds. The disaster loan program attempts to restore to an injured party that which was lost due to
circumstances beyond its control. No distinction is made for eligibility purposes between media and non-media concerns
for physical disaster loans, but economic injury disaster loans are subject to the limitations of the media policy
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes that the assistance it presently makes available under the exceptions to the media rule and under the
SBIC and disaster programs are not sufficient to assist small businesses in the media industries which are demonstrably
in need of increased aid. Accordingly, SBA is proposing to change its policy so as to make assistance available, under
the 7(a) business, economic injury disaster and development company loan programs, to media concerns which are otherwise
eligible for such assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While SBA is proposing to repeal the present rule primarily in order to make assistance available to a larger universe
of small businesses, it is not unmindful of the implications of a total reversal of the policy. It has considered whether
the policy determinations which where the underpinnings of the former rule should be maintained. After careful review,
SBA is persuaded that repeal is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revision of the present rule which would attempt to differentiate among media businesses on the basis of business
activity likely would be challenged in court. There is a risk that such proposed revision would be found unconstitutional.
Keeping the Government from becoming involved with controversial speech may be a worthy goal, but it arguably puts
the Government in the position of allocating benefits with reference to the content of speech. This type of decision
could be held by courts to be in conflict with the First Amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes that it present regulatory apparatus and administrative practice are sufficient to protect the public
interest. In this regard, the present credit criteria under which applications for such assistance are reviewed
and the prohibition on funding illegal activities should be sufficient to provide the desired level of protection.

SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final form, will not constitute a significant regulatory
action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, since the proposed change is not likely to result in an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more. While the proposed rule is intended to make eligible more media small business
concerns, it is reasonable to assume that SBA will not be requested to process a disproportionate number of additional
media loan applications. For example, in fiscal 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively, SBA guaranteed 202, 199 and 241
section 7(a) loans to eligible bookstores, advertising agencies, video stores and vocational schools. The aggregate
amounts of the SBA guaranteed portions for those three years for such businesses were, respectively, $27.7, $28.7
and $35.2 million.

Further, for purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final form,
is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order. (Catalogue

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland
Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes. This proposal would require a revision to
the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise flight crew members that certain cockpit indications may reveal faulty
anti-collision strobe light units, and to provide procedures for subsequent flight crew action. This proposal would
also require a modification that eliminates the need for the AFM revision. This proposal is prompted by reports that
the function of the proximity switch electronics unit (PSEU) may be adversely effected during operation of the white
anti-collision lights. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure correct operation of the PSEU
and its associated systems.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes.
Transport Canada Aviation advises that three field reports indicate that the electrical power supplies of the white
anti-collision lights may develop a fault which produces greater than normal electrical emissions. The cause of
this fault has been attributed to a capacitor failure in some ``Grimes'' strobe light systems. This electromagnetic
interference can adversely affect the operation of the proximity switch electronics unit (PSEU) and its associated
systems. The following occurrences have resulted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Flashing of the landing gear green locked down advisory lights during cruise;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fluctuation of the cabin pressurization rate needle during cruise;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Retraction and extension of roll and ground spoilers during ground operation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Inoperative nose gear steering subsequent to landing; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Unavailable normal wheel brakes below 35&hyph;40 knots.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Incorrect operation of the PSEU and its associated systems may interfere with or distract the flight crew in carrying
out its regular duties during flight or on the ground, and thus serve to compromise the safe operation of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;33&hyph;33, dated May 31, 1993, that describes
flight crew and maintenance procedures to detect faulty power supply units. The alert service bulletin also describes
procedures for replacement of any faulty ``Grimes'' unit with a new or serviceable ``Grimes'' unit, or installation
of a new ``Whelan'' system (Modification 8/1273).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., has also issued Service Bulletin S/B 8&hyph;33&hyph;19, `Revision A', dated May 31, 1993, that
describes procedures for installation of Modification 8/1273, which entails replacing the existing anti-collision
strobe light system (consisting of anti- collision strobe lights, brackets, and power supplies) at all three locations
with the new, improved ``Whelen'' anti-collision strobe light system. (The ``Whelen'' system includes new dual
strobes, new brackets, and new power supplies.) This new system is considered more durable than the currently installed
anti-collision strobe light system. The ``Whelan'' system also has a back-up strobe light at each position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive
CF&hyph;93&hyph;20, dated August 3, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require revising the Limitations section of the FAA-approved
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise flight crew members that certain cockpit indications during in-flight or
ground operations may reveal faulty anti-collision strobe light units, and to provide procedures for subsequent
flight crew action. This proposal would also require replacement of faulty ``Grimes'' units with new or serviceable
``Grimes'' units or installation of the new ``Whelan'' system (Modification 8/1273). The proposed AD would also
require eventual replacement of the existing anti-collision strobe light system with the ``Whelen'' anti-collision
strobe light system (Modification 8/1273) at all three locations. When accomplished, incorporation of this modification
would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this proposal. Following incorporation of Modification
8/1273, operators would be permitted to remove the proposed changes to the AFM. The actions would be required to be
accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, applicability of the proposed rule would exclude those airplanes on which Modification 8/1273 has
been accomplished previously, since airplanes so modified are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this
proposed AD. The manufacturer has installed Modification 8/1273 on airplanes having serial numbers 215 and subsequent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 74 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts for installation of Modification 8/1273 at all three locations would cost approximately $1,397 per
airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $168,498,
or $2,277 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect cracking in
the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the main landing gear (MLG), and replacement
of cracked subassemblies with new or serviceable subassemblies. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracking
in the subassembly of the MLG. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent damage to and/or failure
of the support structure of the MLG.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes
that are equipped with certain Dowty Aerospace main undercarriage units. The RLD advises that cracking has been found
in the fitting subassemblies of the main landing gear (MLG). In three of these instances, the cracking had penetrated
completely through the fitting subassemblies from the side stay attachment lug to the main bore, which resulted in
loss of damping fluid. In another incident, cracking was found in the web section that is adjacent to the inner attachment
bores of the side stay of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. Investigation into the cause of this cracking revealed
that damage to the anodic film resulted in corrosion of these subassemblies. Cracking in the fitting subassemblies
of the MLG, if not corrected, could result in damage to and/or failure of the support structure of the MLG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin F28/32&hyph;149, dated August 30, 1991, that describes procedures for an eddy
current inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the
MLG. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA)
91&hyph;080, Issue 2, dated February 21, 1992, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Dowty Aerospace Gloucester, which is the manufacturer of the main undercarriage units installed
on these airplanes, has issued Service Bulletin 32&hyph;161R, Revision 2, dated January 7, 1992, that describes
procedures for replacement of any cracked subassembly with a new subassembly, or a serviceable subassembly that
has been identified previously with service bulletin number ``32&hyph;161R'' on its nameplate. The Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, classified this service bulletin
as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 023&hyph;06&hyph;91 in order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these aviation products in the United Kingdom. The Fokker service bulletin references this Dowty Aerospace Gloucester
service bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an eddy current inspection to detect cracking
in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. The actions would be required to be
accomplished in accordance with the Fokker service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would also require replacement of any cracked fittings with new or serviceable fittings in accordance
with the Dowty Aerospace Gloucester service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,340, or $770
per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this
AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend regulations to clarify use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on a wine label. In response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comments from consumers and wine industry members, ATF is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that a wine which has been designated with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal type designation in accordance with 27 CFR 4.23a, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and which derives not less than 75 percent of its volume from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pinot noir grapes or Napa Gamay grapes, may be further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated with the optional term ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the optional designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' appears on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brand label, it shall be in direct conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and appellation of origin, in lettering of substantially the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same size and kind. ATF believes that this clarification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' will be informative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consumers and industry in the marketing and purchasing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such wines.

Section 105(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 U.S.C. 205(e), vests broad authority in the Director, ATF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prescribe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations intended to prevent deception of the consumer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to provide the consumer with adequate information as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identity and quality of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations which implement the provisions of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105(e) as they relate to wine are set forth in title 27, Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Federal Regulations, part 4 (27 CFR part 4). Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.23a provides that the name of a single grape variety may be used as the type designation of a grape wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the wine is labeled with an appellation of origin, and if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not less than 75 percent of the wine is derived from grapes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that variety, the entire 75 percent of which was grown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the labeled appellation of origin area. Section 4.34(b)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that an appellation of origin disclosing the true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin of the wine shall appear in direct conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in lettering substantially as conspicuous as the class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and type designation if a grape type (varietal) designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used under the provisions of section 4.23a.

History of Gamay Beaujolais Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For many years ATF has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted the use of ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on wine labels as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal designation. This resulted from the identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 1940's, of a grape grown in Napa County, California as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Gamay grape native to the Beaujolais region of France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the late 1960's, the University of California at Davis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(UCD) determined that the grape known as Napa Gamay was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
true French Gamay and that the Gamay Beaujolais vine was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually a clone of Pinot noir. Since then, ATF has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted wine produced from both the Napa Gamay and Pinot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noir grape varieties to be labeled as ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Foundation Plant Material Service (FPMS) at UCD (a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service operated in cooperation with UCD which makes virus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free, true type plant material available to the industry) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also identified the Gamay Beaujolais vine as a clonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of the Pinot noir variety. More recently, UCD determined that the grape known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as Napa Gamay is not the Gamay grape of France. Napa Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been positively identified by the FPMS as Valdiguie, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although it is not widely known by this name.

Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1982, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF established the Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee (referred to as the ``Committee'') to conduct an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of the hundreds of grape variety names and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synonyms in use [47 FR 13623, March 31, 1982]. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its charter, the Committee was to advise the Director of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grape varieties and subvarieties which are used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of wine, to recommend appropriate label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designations for these varieties, and to recommend guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for approval of names suggested for new grape varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Their recommendations were restricted to grape names used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing American wines. The Committee's final report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented to the Director in September 1984, contained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee's findings regarding use of the most appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
names for domestic winegrape varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One finding which appeared in the l984 final report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory Committee was that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is not the name of any grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety. However, the report did recommend that the term be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted for use during a five year phase out period, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine made either from the grape called Napa Gamay, or from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Gamay Beaujolais clone of Pinot noir.

Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On the basis of the recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Committee's final report, ATF issued Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 581 on February 4, 1986 (51 FR 4392). This notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed the addition of Subpart J, American Grape Variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Names to Part 4. ATF received 156 written comments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In respect to use of Gamay Beaujolais, Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that it should be permitted as an alternate grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety name for future use only for a period of five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period of its continued use, Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that the actual name of the grape, either Pinot noir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Napa Gamay, should appear on the label in direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the passage of five years, Gamay Beaujolais could no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used as a label designation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposal to phase out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of Gamay Beaujolais proved controversial. Only three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents concurred with ATF's proposal to phase out use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay Beaujolais noting that it is not the name of any grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety. Twenty-seven other respondents objected to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. The consensus among these respondents was that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay Beaujolais is well known to consumers as a light red, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
young, fruity wine and that consumers do not view it as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal wine. Several consumers commented that consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition of Gamay Beaujolais is good; that the wine is popular; that consumers know what they are buying; and that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of the designation would serve no consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose. Winery proprietors cited the large market for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine and argued that elimination of the designation would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a severe economic impact on their business and also on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grape growers.

Notice No. 749 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because the comments on Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varied widely in their approach to the proposals, and because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lengthy period of time had passed since the issuance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice No. 581, ATF decided to open the issue of grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal names to additional public comment. Thus, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 3, 1992, ATF issued Notice No. 749 (57 FR 40380), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking comment on new and revised proposals relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grape variety names. In Notice No. 749, ATF proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa Gamay be considered a synonym for the prime name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valdiguie and requested comments on whether Napa Gamay should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be phased out in the future. A resolution of the Napa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay-Valdiguie issue will be in a forthcoming Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision on grape variety names. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The evidence considered by ATF established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is not a true varietal name, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the two grape varieties which have been called ``Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beaujolais'' in this country are not Gamay grapes. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has concluded that Gamay Beaujolais should not be listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Subpart J of 27 CFR Part 4 as a grape variety name. On the basis of the comments to Notice Nos. 581 and 749 and current
trade and consumer recognition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the name, ATF instead believes that Gamay Beaujolais is generally known as a type of red wine which may be described
as light and fruity. However, ATF believes that many consumers associate the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' with
a wine produced from the Pinot noir or Napa Gamay grape varieties. Therefore, instead of phasing out the use of the designation
``Gamay Beaujolais'' as proposed by Notice No. 581, ATF is proposing to specifically allow the continued use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay Beaujolais under section 4.34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only wines produced from the Pinot noir or Napa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay grape varieties have been labeled as ``Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beaujolais,'' ATF believes that consumers now associate those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two varieties with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, ATF believes that as part of its effort to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardize the use of American varietal names, it should no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer allow the unqualified use of the designation ``Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beaujolais'' to refer to two separate grape varieties, neither 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which is a true Gamay grape. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, existing regulations provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a wine is not entitled to a varietal type designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless 75 percent of its volume is derived from grapes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that variety. Accordingly, ATF is proposing to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' only where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine derives not less than 75 percent of its volume from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pinot noir grapes or Napa Gamay grapes. Wine which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' must also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state on the label a varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay) and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellation of origin. Furthermore, the proposed amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 4.34 specifies that the optional designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Gamay Beaujolais'' must appear in direct conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal type designation and the appellation of origin, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that the proposed amendment strikes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance between the views of the opposing commenters on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue. On the one hand, various consumers and winery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietors have commented that consumer recognition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is good, and that winery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietors should not be forced to abandon its use. On the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hand, it has been pointed out that ``Gamay Beaujolais'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not an accurate varietal designation, and the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the varietal grape regulations is to ensure that the consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not misled as to the actual grape varieties used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that allowing the use of the optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' in direct conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as an appellation of origin reflecting the true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin of the grapes, will not be confusing or misleading to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers. The proposed amendment will authorize labels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which clearly inform the consumer about the actual grape variety used to make the wine, and the origin of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the grapes, while still allowing winery proprietors to use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label designation which has gained widespread consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition in this country.

It is hereby certified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal will not have a significant economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a substantial number of small entities. This notice requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on a proposal to authorize the optional use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on a wine label. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of this designation is purely optional, this notice does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not propose any new labeling, reporting, or recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on winery proprietors. Therefore, the proposal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required because the proposal, if promulgated as a final

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule provides for the collection and establishment of a fee to cover the cost of incarceration of inmates
committed to the custody of the Attorney General, and for the further administration of this procedure by the Director,
Bureau of Prisons. This rule is promulgated to implement newly enacted statutory authority on recovering the costs
of incarceration. The rule also is intended to help ensure the continued efficient operation of federal correctional
institutions, including the provision of beneficial programming for inmates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 28, 1993, the Department of Justice published a proposed rule, to be codified at 28 CFR part 505, establishing
procedures for the assessment and collection of a fee to cover the costs of incarceration for federal inmates. (58
FR 34541) In response to public comment and for reasons of administrative management, the Department is publishing
those provisions relating to statutory authority, applicability, and establishment of the fee again for notice
and comment. Further provisions relating to the determination of the average cost of incarceration have been added
to the proposed rule. As an administrative measure, this rule delegates authority to the Director, Bureau of Prisons
(Bureau), to promulgate regulations for collecting the costs of incarceration for inmates committed to the custody
of the Attorney General and to collect such fees. The provisions in the Bureau of Prisons regulations (for example,
procedures for exemption, waiver, or proration of fee assessment, calculation of assessment, and payment and appeal
procedures) will be based upon the previously published proposed rule. Response to public comment on the previously
published proposed rule relating to statutory authority, applicability, establishment of fee, the determination
of the average cost, and administrative procedure is summarized below. Response to public comment relating to other
provisions of the previously published proposed rule will be contained in the commentary for the separate Bureau
of Prisons rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule were received from seven individuals (a federal employee, a law professor, and five
federal inmates). An additional comment was received later from one of the original commenters purporting to contain
the comments of two additional federal inmates. One commenter was in favor of the proposed rule, responding that criminal
defendants should be required not only to pay the costs of their incarceration, but also to bear the burden of the social
and economic costs of their crimes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has carefully reviewed the public comments received concerning the proposed rule and has determined
that a revised rule should be published for comment.

Attorney General's Certification and Rule Indexing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters contested the validity of the rule on procedural grounds. One commenter disagreed with the Attorney
General's certification pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. This commenter argues that the rule will have a significant financial impact
on various inmates and their families owning joint property or filing joint tax returns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's certification pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12, is
appropriate in this case. Under the RFA, neither an inmate or the inmate's family satisfies the definition of a ``small
entity,'' which is defined by the Act as a ``small business,'' ``small organization,'' or ``small governmental jurisdiction''.
5 U.S.C. 601(6). Further discussion of the agency provisions for the amelioration of the potential hardships faced
by certain inmates and their families due to the imposition of a fee for costs of incarceration will be contained in
the commentary for the final rule to be issued by the Bureau of Prisons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second procedural comment received made the proposition that because the proposed rule was indexed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under ``justice'' rather than ``prisons,'' notice of the proposed rule may have been improper. However, this choice
of indexing was due to the fact that the Bureau of Prisons is within the Department of Justice and under the oversight
authority of the Attorney General. Likewise, the rule was originating from the Attorney General and the Department
of Justice. Thus, the rule was properly indexed under ``justice'' rather than ``prisons'' and no notice provisions
of the Administrative Procedure Act were violated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to avoid any further confusion on this issue, however, the Department has decided to issue its regulations
on costs of incarceration as two separate rules. The first rule, proposed for codification at 28 CFR 0.96c, provides
the authority for establishing and collecting a fee for the costs of one year of incarceration. This rule also specifies
the calculation used to determine the average cost of incarceration. In addition, the rule designates the Director
of the Bureau of Prisons as being responsible for the review of the fee, for its calculation in accordance with the formula
set forth in &sect;0.96c(b), and for the publication of each year's fee (or revised fee) as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule also delegates to the Director the authority to promulgate regulations concerning the collection of the
fee, to be codified as a second rule at 28 CFR part 505. As previously proposed, the Director would have been required
both to public the current fee as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and to amend the fee in the regulation. This requirement has been modified in the interest of reducing unnecessary
regulatory publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Average Cost of Incarceration Figure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to comments concerning the substantive provisions of the proposed rule, three commenters disagreed
with the figure stated in proposed &sect;505.2(b) representing the average cost of incarceration. Two commenters
asserted that the average cost figure is not a fair calculation basis for those inmates placed in or transferred to
minimum-security_and thus lower cost_institutions within the first year. One commenter stated that the figure
was irrational, believing that the assessment would reduce inmates to the poverty level. Finally, one commenter
contended that the Bureau of Prisons should not determine the average cost of incarceration figure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these contentions, the Attorney General believes that this figure is a reasonable interpretation of the
implementing statute. The plain language of section 111 of Public Law 102&hyph;395 orders the Attorney General to
``establish and collect a fee to cover the costs of confinement,'' with such fee being ``equivalent to the average
cost of one year of incarcertation.'' Public Law 102&hyph;395, section 111(a) (1), (2), 106 Stat. 1828, 1842 (1992).
Although at first glance it may seem fair to assess each fee based upon each individual inmate's cost of incarceration,
this figure would not represent the ``average cost'' to the United States to confine every prisoner. Nor would basing
the fee upon each inmate's initially designated institution be a fair assessment. While an inmate initially could
be designated to a lower cost facility, within the first year he or she might be redesignated to a higher security/administrative,
and higher cost, institution. Thus, the figure merely represents the average cost to the Bureau of Prisons to confine
any prisoner and, accordingly, is a reasonable choice for the Attorney General to make in order to comply with the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to clarify the process and address these concerns, the Department is including in the proposed rule the formula
used to calculate the average cost of one year of incarceration (see &sect;0.96c(b)). This calculation is intended
to provide a figure reflective of the actual costs expended to maintain inmates at Bureau facilities. The fee is calculated
by dividing the expenses incurred at the Central, Regional, and institution level in such areas as salaries, supplies,
travel, and equipment for the care and custody of inmates (e.g., security, programming, maintenance and general
administration), excluding activation costs, by the number of inmate days, and by then multiplying the quotient
by 365. The number of inmate days is calculated by adding, cumulatively, the number of inmates in custody at a given
time each day for the one year period. Activation costs are those expenses incurred by the Bureau in the construction
of new facilities and in their operation before staff assume control of the facility for the arrival of inmates.

Costs of Incarceration Fee vs. Costs of Imprisonment Fine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters pointed out the correlation between this fee assessment and the costs of imprisonment fine imposed
by the sentencing judge pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (USSG) section 5E1.2(i). U.S.S.G. 5E1.2(i).
One commenter believed that the fee assessment in the proposed rule was the responsibility of the sentencing judge,
the other commenter questioned whether proposed rule &sect;505.2(c) vitiates the application of U.S.S.G. &sect;5E1.2(i).
A third commenter noted that the Third Circuit has held that the absence of an authorizing statute in the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 renders &sect;5E1.2(i) invalid. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the two provisions are analogous in their end result, they are not analogous in origin or intent. The amount assessed
under U.S.S.G. &sect;5E1.2(i) is a fine, pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, and is meant to be punitive
in nature as part of an inmate's overall sentence. In contrast, the cost assessed under the proposed rule is a fee, pursuant
to the plain language of a federal statute, and is meant to recoup the administrative costs of confinement and improve
institutional programs. Furthermore, inmates will be assessed only one amount for their costs of confinement. They
will either be assessed a fine under &sect;5E1.2, or a fee under the proposed rule if the sentencing judge did not assess
or waive the fine under &sect;5E1.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters disagreed with the fact that under the proposed rule &sect;505.1, revocation of parole or supervised
release is treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may be imposed. However, this interpretation
is reasonable because in each instance, the offender's conduct results in a distinct incarceration period and an
additional expense to the Attorney General for the cost of the confinement.

 964 F.2d 853 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 635 (1992). However, that case, involving a Missouri statute concerning
the recoupment of costs-of-confinement, was decided narrowly upon Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and federal
law preemption grounds; it did not involve the constitutionality of Missouri's entire cost-of-confinement program,
or such programs in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The rule is a matter of internal department management. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order
12866.

(a) The Attorney General is authorized to establish and collect a fee to cover the cost of one year of incarceration.
These provisions apply to any person who is convicted in a United States District Court and committed to the custody
of the Attorney General, and who begins service of sentence on or after May 5, 1994. For the purposes of this subpart,
revocation of parole or supervised release shall be treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may
be imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The fee to cover the costs of incarceration shall be calculated by dividing the number representing the obligation
encountered in Bureau of Prisons facilities (excluding activation costs) by the number of inmate-days incurred
for the year, and by then multiplying the quotient by 365. The resulting figure represents the average cost to the Bureau
for confining an inmate for one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons is delegated the authority to collect the fee to cover the cost of incarceration
from inmates committed to the custody of the Attorney General and to promulgate all regulations concerning the collection
of the fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 NMFS has previously announced scoping meetings for Atlantic billfish. The purpose of the scoping meetings is to receive
comments concerning the Atlantic billfish fishery from fishery participants and other members of the public regarding:
A definition of overfishing; reducing fishing mortality; reporting requirements; and other issues. NMFS is also
soliciting written comments on issues of concern in this fishery. NMFS requests input at any time during the scoping
process, by mail or by fax. An issues/options statement was prepared for the initial hearing and revised, based on
written and oral comments, for subsequent hearings. This notice announces the first of several additional scoping
meetings and extends the comment period for the billfish scoping meetings.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By this notice, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposes to adopt standards addressing
indoor air quality in indoor work environments. The basis for this proposed action is a preliminary determination
that employees working in indoor work environments face a significant risk of material impairment to their health
due to poor indoor air quality, and that compliance with the provisions proposed in this notice will substantially
reduce that risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the standard are proposed to apply to all indoor ``nonindustrial work environments.'' In addition,
all worksites, both industrial and nonindustrial within OSHA's jurisdiction are covered with respect to the proposed
provisions addressing control of environmental tobacco smoke. The proposal would require affected employers to
develop a written indoor air quality compliance plan and implement that plan through actions such as inspection and
maintenance of building systems which influence indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions under the standard also propose to require employers to implement controls for specific contaminants
and their sources such as outdoor air contaminants, microbial contamination, maintenance and cleaning chemicals,
pesticides, and other hazardous chemicals within indoor work environments. Designated smoking areas which are
to be separate, enclosed rooms exhausted directly to the outside are proposed to be required in buildings where the
smoking of tobacco products is not prohibited. Specific provisions are also proposed to limit the degradation of
indoor air quality during the performance of renovation, remodeling and similar activities. Provisions for information
and training of building system maintenance and operation workers and other employees within the facility are also
included in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, proposed provisions in this notice address the establishment, retention, availability, and transfer
of records such as inspection and maintenance records, records of written compliance programs, and employee complaints
of building-related illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency invites the submission of written data, views and comments on all regulatory provisions proposed in this
notice, and on all relevant issues pertinent to those provisions. OSHA is also scheduling an informal public hearing
where persons may orally submit their views. It is noted here that subsequent

A. Events Leading to This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern about the health hazards posed by occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) prompted three
public interest groups to petition the Agency in May 1987 for an Emergency Temporary Standard under section 6(c) of
the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(c). The American Public Health Association and Public
Citizen submitted a joint petition; Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) also submitted a petition. The petitions requested
the prohibition of smoking in most indoor workplaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA determined, that available data with respect to exposures were insufficient to demonstrate the existence of
a ``grave danger,'' within the meaning of section 6(c) of the OSH Act, from workplace exposure to ETS. OSHA denied the
petitions in September 1989 but continued to investigate regulatory options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1989 ASH filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of OSHA's
denial of its petition for an Emergency Temporary Standard. The court denied ASH's petition for review in May 1991,
finding that OSHA has reasonably determined that it could not sufficiently quantify the workplace risk associated
with tobacco smoke to justify an Emergency Temporary Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA issued on September 20, 1991, a Request for Information (RFI) (56 FR 47892) on indoor air quality problems, in
order to obtain information necessary to determine whether it would be appropriate and feasible to pursue regulatory
action concerning Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). Issues on which comments were requested in the RFI included health effects
attributable to poor IAQ, ventilation systems performance, exposure assessment, and abatement methods. Information
concerning specific contaminants such as ETS and bioaerosols was also requested.

In March 1992, the AFL&hyph;CIO petitioned OSHA to promulgate an overall IAQ standard. OSHA responded in May 1992
that such a standard was under consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the RFI, over 1,200 comments were submitted by interested persons, groups, unions, and industries.
Issues of particular concern identified in the comments, in addition to health effects considerations, include
the lack of ventilation performance standards; the lack of worker training on the operation and maintenance of Heating
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems; the lack of pollutant source control; and the lack of available
technical guidance on IAQ issues and control techniques.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the comments that specifically addressed the question of whether OSHA should regulate IAQ, a majority (75%) indicate
support for regulation. Of those that commented on the need for regulation, approximately 21% were explicitly in
favor of a regulation on ETS, more than 41% were in favor of an overall IAQ regulation, and approximately 13% were in
favor of a combined IAQ regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous comments focused on the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke and of general indoor air pollution. The
health effects of concern relevant to both tobacco smoke and indoor air pollutants ranged from the acute irritant
effects to cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments submitted in response to the RFI indicated wide support for a regulatory approach that would focus on the
design, operation and maintenance of building ventilation systems, source reduction methodology, and worker information
and training programs. Commenters also recommended that provisions should require that employers receive training
about the regulation and the need for compliance, and that their training regarding building HVAC maintenance and
operation be tailored to the level of complexity of the HVAC system and their personal degree of involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters particularly felt that regulation of IAQ was necessary to eliminate exposures to ETS in the workplace.
Commenters urged the Agency to either ban smoking completely from the workplace or allow smoking only in separately
ventilated, designated smoking areas that were separate from work areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that data submitted to the record, and other evidence, support the conclusion that air contaminants
and other air quality factors can act to present a significant risk of material impairment to employees working in
indoor environments. Adverse health effects associated with poor IAQ may include sensory irritation, respiratory
allergies, asthma, nosocomial infections, humidifier fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Legionnaires' disease,
and the signs and symptoms characteristic of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon monoxide,
formaldehyde, pesticides, endotoxins, or mycotoxins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that available data support proposing regulation of IAQ, including exposure to ETS. Further
stimulus for this determination was provided by conclusions reached in a report published in December, 1992 by the
Environmental Protection Agency, addressing hazards associated with exposure to ETS. In that study, Respiratory
Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders [Ex. 4&hyph;311], EPA concluded that exposure
to ETS presents an excess risk of induction of cancer in humans. OSHA has submitted this proposed standard to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency which is reviewing it in detail for purposes of submitting detailed comments to
the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons noted above, and discussed in the following sections, OSHA is proposing to address indoor air quality
problems, including exposure to ETS, as set forth in this notice.

Indoor air quality problems can occur in all types and ages of buildings; in newly constructed buildings, in renovated
or remodeled buildings, and in old buildings. Problems in new, clean buildings are rarely, if ever, related to microbial
growth, since the physical structures are new [Ex. 3&hyph;61]. Older buildings that have not been adequately maintained
and operated may have problems with bioaerosols if parts of the building have been allowed to become reservoirs for
microbial growth. Also, if inadequate outside air is provided, regardless of the age of the building, chemical and
biological contaminants will build up to levels that can cause health effects in some workers. In addition, other
physical factors such as lack of windows, noise, and inadequate lighting, and ergonomic factors involving uncomfortable
furniture and intensive use of video display units, etc., will cause discomfort in occupants that may be inaccurately
attributed to air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Some information contained in the docket indicates that these chronic health complaints are psychological, however,
OSHA believes that chronic health complaints related to poor indoor air quality are unlikely to be due to mass psychogenic
illness, even though a psychological overlay is common. It is true that poor management, boring work, poor lighting
conditions, temperature variations, poor ergonomic design, and noise may all lower the threshold for complaint.
Nevertheless, air quality complaints usually have some basis, although they are often difficult to assess with specificity
[Exs. 3&hyph;61C, 4&hyph;144]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Indoor air quality problems are generally classified as Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) or Building-related Illness
(BRI). However, a very important constituent of poor indoor air quality is ETS because of the serious health effects
that result from exposure. The following discussion will first identify the health effects associated with SBS and
BRI. A discussion of the health effects associated with exposure to ETS will follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is important to note that OSHA considers these health effects to be material impairments of health when the worker
is clinically diagnosed with a condition that is either caused or aggravated by poor indoor air quality in the workplace.
For example, in the formaldehyde standard (29 CFR 1910.1048) [Ex. 4&hyph;107] OSHA determined that a physician's
diagnosis of irritation met the requirement of material impairment of health. In addition, OSHA considers all the
other health effects discussed, which are more clinically severe than irritation, to be material impairments of
health as well.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Typically, health effects caused by poor indoor air quality have been categorized as SBS or BRI. In 1983, the World
Health Organization published a list of eight non-inclusive symptoms that characterize Sick Building Syndrome
[Ex. 4&hyph;325]. These include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat; dry mucous membranes and skin; erythema;
mental fatigue and headache; respiratory infections and cough; hoarseness of voice and wheezing; hypersensitivity
reactions; and nausea and dizziness. Generally, these conditions are not easily traced to a specific substance,
but are perceived as resulting from some unidentified contaminant or combination of contaminants. Symptoms are
relieved when the employee leaves the building and may be reduced or eliminated by modifying the ventilation system.
Comments to the docket indicate that such symptoms have been observed in and reported by workers [Exs. 3&hyph;446,
4&hyph;87]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In some instances, outbreaks of SBS are identified with specific pollutant exposures, but in general only general
etiologic factors related to building design, operation and maintenance can be identified [Ex. 4&hyph;274]. In
1987, Woods et al. [Ex. 3&hyph;745] conducted a stratified random telephone survey of 600 U.S. office workers across
the national. Twenty four percent reported that they were dissatisfied with the air quality at the office; while 20%
perceived their performance to be hampered by poor indoor air quality. Women were nearly twice as likely to report
a productivity effect of poor indoor air quality than men (28% versus 15%). Based on this, Woods et al. [Ex. 3&hyph;745]
hypothesized that 20% of U.S. office workers are exposed to indoor conditions which manifest as SBS. In fact, complaints
about SBS have become so numerous that 37 out of 53 states and territories have designated a building complaints investigation
contact person [Ex. 4&hyph;310].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Breysse [Ex. 4&hyph;32] reported on symptoms associated with new carpeting in a state office building, in order of
prevalence: headache, eye and throat irritation, nausea, dizziness, eye tearing, chest tightness, diarrhea, cough,
muscle aches, burning nose, fatigue, dark urine, and rashes. Twenty out of 35 persons were affected. Air sampling
was conducted before and after carpet removal; a similar range of aliphatic hydrocarbons was found after removal,
but in much lower concentrations. Many individuals who believe the building they work in is implicated in SBS, have
described similar effects. Symptoms usually include one or more of the following: mucous membrane (eye, nose, or
throat) irritation, dry skin, headache, nausea, fatigue, and lethargy [Ex. 4&hyph;293]. These symptoms are generally
believed to result from indoor air pollution. There is no secondary spread of symptoms to others outside the building
who are exposed to the occupants (unlike the situation faced by many chemical and asbestos workers). Anderson [Ex.
4&hyph;10] suggested the possible causes for SBS as related to psychosocial, chemical, physical, or biological
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Anderson [Ex. 4&hyph;10] distinguished SBS symptoms as different from mass psychogenic illness; although in general
the causes of SBS are unknown, he suggested that most SBS symptoms could be explained by stimulation of sensory nerve
fibers in the upper airways and the face (referred to as common chemical sense). Because these fibers can respond in
only one way, SBS cases largely have the same symptoms irrespective of the cause [Ex. 4&hyph;10]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is now known that there is a variety of important health effects from indoor air pollution. In addition to the indoor
environmental disease caused by infectious agents, carcinogens or toxins; the indoor environment may create conditions
that can produce skin and mucosal allergy and hyperactivity reactions, sensory effects (odors and irritations),
airways effects (from both acute and chronic exposures), neuropsychological effects, and psychosocial effects,
especially due to the lack of social support [Ex. 4&hyph;200]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Indoor air pollution may be caused by physical, chemical, or microbiological agents, and is aggravated by poor ventilation.
The causation of SBS by indoor air pollution was first objectively demonstrated in 1984 in a study of 62 Danish subjects
suffering from ``indoor climate symptoms'' [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. These subjects reported primarily eye and upper respiratory
irritation, but were otherwise healthy individuals, and did not suffer from asthma, allergy, or bronchitis. The
subjects were exposed to a mixture of 22 volatile organic chemicals commonly found in the indoor environment at concentrations
of 0, 5, and 25 mg/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These concentrations corresponded respectively to ``clean'' air, average polluted air in Danish houses, and maximum
polluted air in Danish houses. After exposure, the Digit Span test was administered. The Digit Span test consists
of the subject being allowed to view a series of random digits for a short period of time; the numbers are then covered
up and the subject asked to repeat the sequence backwards. This test is reported to be sensitive to situational anxiety
and alertness, and therefore a measure of stress and ability to concentrate. Bach et al. found significant declines
in performance on the digit span test following exposure to these low levels of volatile organic chemicals, demonstrating
objectively the existence of SBS [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Molhave et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;228], in reporting on the same 62 subjects, found that subjects exposed for 23/4 hrs did
not adapt, and that the subjects reacted to irritation of the mucous membranes and not to odor intensity. The exposure
was doubled-blind, and neither the subjects nor the testers knew the exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although these problems have been demonstrated to be real, they may affect only a small percentage of building occupants.
Also, there are various degrees of problems which may occur. Some individuals who experience relatively mild and
treatable symptoms such as headache, may be able to cope with the sick building environment for extended periods,
although suffering from increased stress. Other individuals, more seriously affected, may find symptoms so severe
that they may be unable to be in the building for extended periods, or at all. Still others may become temporarily or
permanently disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It has been suggested that SBS may not be one syndrome but a number of sub-syndromes [Ex. 4&hyph;170]. This hypothesis
suggests that the symptoms particularly associated with chemical exposure include fatigue; headache; dry and irritated
eyes, nose, and throat; and sometimes include nausea and dizziness. Those symptoms most related to microbial exposures
would result in itchy, congested, or runny nose; itchy watery eyes; and sometimes include wheezing, tight chest,
or flu-like symptoms. The overlapping symptoms in each case are eye, nose, and throat irritation, perhaps making
the two sub-syndromes, chemical and microbial, difficult to distinguish. Jones concludes that there is a need for
a treatment protocol as well as a diagnostic protocol, which, in addition to describing corrective actions available
in response to different diagnostic findings, would also provide guidelines for the design and implementation of
follow-up studies of buildings and individuals in order to assess treatment effectiveness [Ex. 3&hyph;170].

 Randolph and Moss [Ex. 4&hyph;258] have written about a number of problems ascribed to indoor air pollution in the
chemically sensitive patient. These problems include irritability from natural gas fumes, allergy to dust from
forced air ventilation systems, intoxication and even hallucination from paint fumes. Randolph describes chemical
sensitivity to dry cleaning chemicals, and rug shampoo, and implicates moldy carpets in producing allergenic substances.
He also describes joint pain, malaise, and fatigue due to pesticide exposure; and skin rashes from exposure to plasticizers.
Randolph further describes intolerance to highly scented products such as deodorant soaps, toilet deodorants,
and disinfectants, especially pine-scented ones. Other patients have reported reacting to strong perfumes and
other cosmetics. So-called air fresheners often prove to be particularly troublesome. He also describes that some
patients are sensitive to the odors from hot plastic-coated wires in electronic equipment.

 There is little data on the perceptions of victims of SBS. Shapiro [Ex. 4&hyph;282] has complied a summary of 16 case-histories
of SBS in the victims' own words. It is useful to review these for insight into the problems from the victims' point of
view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One episode that Shapiro [Ex. 4&hyph;282] reported on was in a building occupied by a government agency. As a result
of problems related to carpeting and other suspected causes, five workers were reported to have left the agency, 11
were relocated to alternative workspace or worked at home, and 100 reported to the agency's medical officer that they
had SBS related problems. The range of self-reported symptoms included a variety of moderate and acute respiratory
problems; headache; sore throat; burning of the eyes, lungs, and skin; rashes; fatigue; laryngitis; clumsiness;
disorientation; loss of balance; nausea; numbness in extremities and face; and difficulty with mental tasks.

 The patient's reported that the diagnoses of the occupational health physicians they visited included upper and
lower respiratory irritation, intoxication-type syndrome, occupational asthma, and chronic hypersensitivity
pneumonitis.

The central nervous system effects reported by many do not lend themselves to ready diagnosis [Ex. 4&hyph;282]. Some
of the lesser affected individuals either saw no physician at all or saw a family doctor or allergist who was not familiar
with occupational or environmental health [Ex. 4&hyph;282]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Force Procedural Guide [Ex. 4&hyph;199] on dealing with SBS takes a practical view: ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;in
most cases the sick building syndrome does not have a clearly understood etiology and many of the SBS studies and investigations
were inconclusive. The significance of exposure that [what chemical or physical agent concentrations cause symptoms]
can be pathogenic remains unanswered, but the realities of worker complaints and discomfort are valid reasons to
seriously address this problem.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, SBS is not a well-defined disease with well-defined causes. It appears to be a reaction, at least in part
due to stimulation of the common chemical sense, to a variety of chemical, physical or biological stimuli. Its victims
display all or some of a pattern of irritation of the mucous membranes, and the worst affected individuals have neurological
symptoms as well.

B. Building-Related Illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Building-related illness (BRI) describes specific medical conditions of known etiology which can often be documented
by physical signs and laboratory findings. Such illnesses include sensory irritation when caused by known agents,
respiratory allergies, nosocomial infections, humidifier fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Legionnaires'
disease, and the symptoms and signs characteristic of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon
monoxide, formaldehyde, pesticides, endotoxins, or mycotoxins [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;144]. Some of these conditions
are caused by exposure to bioaerosols containing whole or parts of viruses, fungi, bacteria, or protozoans. These
illnesses are often potentially severe and, in contrast to SBS complaints, are often traceable to a specific contaminant
source, such as mold infestation and/or microbial growth in cooling towers, air handling systems, and water-damaged
furnishings. Symptoms may or may not disappear when the employee leaves the building. Susceptibility is influenced
by host factors, such as age and immune system status. Mitigation of building-related illnesses requires identification
and removal of the source, especially in cases involving hypersensitivity responses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments submitted to the docket in response to the RFI and contained in the literature indicate that specific substances
or classes of substances have been implicated as contributing to poor indoor air quality problems. These substances,
either alone or in synergy, have produced health effects that OSHA believes can be considered material impairment
[Ex. 4&hyph;124]. In most cases, people likely to be at risk have specific susceptibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
But such susceptibility is common and adverse effects can arise suddenly following exposure. The relevant effects
can be categorized into six categories: irritation, pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous system, reproductive,
and cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Common chemical sense or irritation perception is mediated through receptors found not only throughout the nasal,
pharyngeal, and laryngeal areas of the respiratory system but also on the surface of the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva
and cornea [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. It is partially through the stimulation of these receptors that exposed persons perceive
irritation. Many comments to the docket, from citizens, researchers, and indoor air consultants, raised the issue
about the irritating effects related to known indoor air contaminants. The air contaminants of concern include formaldehyde
[Exs. 3&hyph;14, 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440a, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;575, 4&hyph;125, 4&hyph;144,
4&hyph;214], volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500, 4&hyph;145, 4&hyph;243,
4&hyph;320], ozone [Exs. 3&hyph;14, 4&hyph;42, 4&hyph;134, 4&hyph;236, 4&hyph;237], carpet-associated chemicals
[Exs. 3&hyph;25, 3&hyph;444D, 3&hyph;576, 4&hyph;144, 4&hyph;214], vehicle exhausts [Exs. 3&hyph;6, 3&hyph;63,
3&hyph;206, 3&hyph;238, 3&hyph;360, 3&hyph;437, 3&hyph;444D, 3&hyph;631, 3&hyph;659], combustion gases [Ex.
3&hyph;32], particulates [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], man-made mineral fibers (fiberglass, glasswool
and rockwool) [Ex. 4&hyph;33], and pesticides [Ex. 3&hyph;446]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The irritation effects present as sensory irritation of the skin and upper airways, irritation of eye, nose and throat,
dry mucous membranes, erythema, headache, and abnormal taste [Ex. 3&hyph;14, 4&hyph;33]. The pulmonary effects
include upper and lower respiratory tract effects such as rapid breathing, fatigue, increased infection rate, broncho-constriction,
pulmonary edema, asthma, allergies and flu-like symptoms. Acute exposure to low level of air contaminants results
in primarily reversible effects, while chronic exposure may result in pulmonary fibrosis that can result in irreversible
damage [Exs. 3&hyph;14, 4&hyph;33]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These health effects were associated, as reported in many comments to the docket, with specific contaminants, including
asbestos [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500], combustion gases [Exs. 3&hyph;14, 3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;440A,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], formaldehyde [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A, 4&hyph;124], ozone
[Exs. 4&hyph;42, 4&hyph;237], VOCs [Ex. 3&hyph;32], vehicular exhaust [Ex. 3&hyph;63], and particulates [Exs.
3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals with underlying pulmonary disease, such as asthma, are more susceptible than others to acute exposure
to these indoor air contaminants and experience coughing and wheezing at low levels of exposure. Synergism may occur
between chemical contaminants, such as ozone and VOCs, in aggravating asthma [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. These affected individuals
may also be at increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the synergistic effect between chemical and microbial
contaminants [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cardiovascular effects have also been associated with poor indoor air quality. These effects are presented as headache,
fatigue, dizziness, aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease, and damage to the heart. These effects are
associated with exposure to combustion gases such as carbon monoxide [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;440A], VOCs [Ex. 3&hyph;500],
and particulates [Ex. 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nervous system effects have also been produced due to exposure to poor indoor air quality. These effects include headache,
blurred vision, fatigue, malaise with nausea, ringing in the ears, impaired judgement, and polyneuritis. These
effects are associated with exposure to carbon dioxide [Ex. 3&hyph;14], carbon monoxide [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], formaldehyde [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], and VOCs [Exs. 3&hyph;32,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relevant reproductive effects include menstrual irregularities and birth defects and are associated with exposure
to formaldehyde [Exs. 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500] and VOCs [Exs. 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The occurrence of cancer has also been attributed to exposures associated with poor indoor air quality. In particular,
cancer of the lung, including mesothelioma, esophagus, stomach, and colon have been associated with exposure to
asbestos [Exs. 3&hyph;6, 3&hyph;14, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500], radon [Exs. 3&hyph;35,
3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500], vehicular exhausts [Exs. 3&hyph;84, 3&hyph;206, 3&hyph;360H],
combustion gases [Ex. 3&hyph;500], VOCs [Exs. 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500, 4&hyph;294], and particulates [Ex. 3&hyph;500].

2. Microbial Contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Building-related illnesses can result in serious illness and death. Indoor transmission of disease caused by obligate
pathogens (microbes that require a living host) is common in indoor environments, especially those that are overcrowded
and inadequately ventilated [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Diseases in this category include influenza, rhinovirus or colds,
and measles. Indoor transmission of disease caused by opportunistic microorganisms usually affects compromised
individuals, those with existing conditions that make them more susceptible to infection, such as pulmonary disease
or immunodeficiency. Legionnaires' disease, pulmonary tract infections, and humidifier fever are diseases that
fall into this category. Diseases that affect the immune system include allergic reactions, as seen in antibody-mediated
responses (asthma and rhinitis) and interstitial lung disease, as seen in cell-mediated reactions (hypersensitivity
pneumonitis) [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. All of these diseases produce substantial amounts of illness each year [Exs. 4&hyph;33,
4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;214].

In the U.S., Legionnaires' disease is considered to be a fairly common, serious form of pneumonia. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bacterium is one of the top three bacterial agents in the U.S. which causes sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.
Because of the difficulty in clinically distinguishing this disease from other forms of pneumonia, many cases go
unreported. Although approximately 1,000 cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention annually,
it has been estimated that over 25,000 cases of the illness actually occur. This disease burden is estimated to result
in over 5,000 to 7,000 deaths per year [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. Brooks et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;33] reported that as many as 116,000
cases occur each year. Of these cases, it is estimated that between 35,000 and 40,000 die. The attack rate for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. pneumophila 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ranges from 0.1 to 5%. The case fatality rate ranges from 15 to 20% [Ex. 4&hyph;214]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two serious allergic or hypersensitivity diseases are asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic
alveolitis). An estimated 3% of the U.S. population suffers from asthma (approximately 9,000,000 people) [Ex. 4&hyph;41].
These individuals may be more susceptible to bioaerosol contamination or chemical contamination of the indoor environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is triggered by recurrent exposure to microbials, fumes, vapors, and dusts [Ex. 4&hyph;33].
The lung interstitium, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli react in an inflammatory process that can organize into
granulomas and progress to fibrosis. The symptoms of acute episodes of this disease are malaise, fever, chills, cough
and dyspnea. The symptoms of chronic episodes are serious respiratory symptoms such as progressive dyspnea. Chronic
disease can lead to irreversible pulmonary structural and functional changes [Ex. 4&hyph;33].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 15% (20,250) of 135,000 hospital admissions per year that last an average of more than eight days are
due to allergic disease [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. Burge and Hodgson estimate that these hospitalizations cost five million
work days per year. The prevalence of symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an interstitial lung
disease caused by organic dusts or by aerosols has been examined in subpopulations at well-defined, increased risk,
such as farmers (0.1&hyph;32%) or pigeon breeders (0.1&hyph;21%) [Exs. 4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;214]. The only unbiased
source of complaint rates in unselected office workers are control buildings used in the study of hypersensitivity
pneumonitis in the U.S. Arnow et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;15] reported complaints consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis
in 1.2 percent and Gamble et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;116] in 4 percent of these populations. Since no clinical data are available,
it is not known how these complaints are related to actual disease, and it is unknown whether these complaints are associated
with lost work time, doctor visits or hospital admissions [Ex. 4&hyph;41].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Humidifier fever, a less serious variant of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also is caused by exposure to microorganisms
contained in an aerosol. Attack rates in building epidemics have been as high as 75%, whereas complaint rates are usually
2&hyph;3% in nonepidemic situations [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. Because of the similarity of the individual symptoms to other
diseases (fever, headache, polyuria, weight loss and joint pain), it is often difficult to separate actual disease
from complaints related to the common cold in nonepidemic situations [Exs. 4&hyph;33, 4&hyph;41]. While rare, a
workplace epidemic of humidifier fever can virtually shut down an entire building, and only removal of the contamination
will end the epidemic [Exs. 4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;144, 4&hyph;214].

Microbial contamination of building structures, furnishings, and HVAC system components contribute to poor indoor
air quality problems, especially those related to building-related illnesses. OSHA believes that consequent health
effects constitute material impairment of health [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;41]. These can be categorized as irritation,
pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous system, reproductive, and cancer effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irritation effects, either from the physical presence of bioaerosols or from exposure to VOCs released by biologicals,
have been demonstrated in susceptible workers [Ex. 3&hyph;32]. In addition, water leakage on furnishings or within
building components can result in the proliferation of microorganisms that can release acutely irritating substances
into the air. Typically, where microorganisms are allowed to grow, a moldy smell develops. This moldy smell is often
associated with microbial contamination and is a result of VOCs released during microbial growth on environmental
substrates [Ex. 4&hyph;41].

Pulmonary effects which have been associated with exposure to bioaerosols include rhinitis, asthma, allergies,
hypersensitivity diseases, humidifier fever, spread of infections including colds, viruses, and tuberculosis,
and the occurrence of Legionnaire's disease [Exs. 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;61B, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500, 4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;144, 4&hyph;214]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building-related asthma has also recently been documented in office workers [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;43] and some
case reports show it to be associated specifically with humidifier use. Biocides used in humidification systems
are suspected causes of office-associated asthma [Ex. 4&hyph;103].

Cardiovascular effects manifested as chest pain, and nervous system effects manifested as headache, blurred vision,
and impaired judgment, have occurred in susceptible people following exposure to bioaerosols [Exs. 3&hyph;32,
3&hyph;446]. It has been suggested that these effects may be caused by VOCs released by the microbiologicals, or they
may be a complication of related pulmonary effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of cancer in susceptible people is possible following exposure to certain types of toxigenic fungi
and mycotoxins. However, the probability of such exposures occurring in workplaces covered by this standard is probably
limited. Mycotoxins (toxins produced as secondary metabolites by many fungi) are among the most carcinogenic of
known substances, and are also acutely toxic. The American Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists
wrote ``[t]he toxigenic fungi are common contaminants of stored grain and other food products and have caused well-described
outbreaks of acute systemic toxicosis as well as specific organ carcinogenesis when such food is consumed *&blank;*&blank;*
It appears clear that massive contamination with a highly toxigenic fungus strain of a site in which aerial dispersion
of metabolic products occurred would be necessary to induce acute symptoms. However, considering the carcinogenicity
of many fungal toxins, an examination of the risks of chronic inhalation exposure appears justified'' [Ex. 3&hyph;61].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, most of the health effects associated with SBS and BRI occur in indoor environments were concentrations
of pollutants are much less than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs) (29 CFR 1910.1000) [Ex. 4&hyph;3]. It
is important to point out that the PELs are chemical-specific standards that are not only based on health effects but
also on technological feasibility, cost restraints and a ``healthy'' worker exposed for a 40-hour work week. In the
industrial workplace, hazards are minimized by the use of administrative and engineering controls and the use of
personal protective equipment. The nonindustrial environment, however, does not have these controls. Ventilation
systems are designed only to remove occupant-generated contaminants, such as carbon dioxide and odors. These types
of systems were not designed to dilute multiple point sources of contaminants that are typically found in nonindustrial
workplaces (see section III). Unless adequate ventilation and source controls are utilized and adequately maintained,
many of the chemical contaminants can concentrate to levels that induce symptoms. The possibility exists that synergistic
effects occur. These effects occur not only between substances to enhance their toxicity but also by lowering the
resistance to lung infection in susceptible persons.

ETS is composed of exhaled mainstream and sidestream smoke. The chemical composition and exposure sources of ETS
are described in the Exposure section of this preamble (see Section III). The pharmacokinetics of ETS have been widely
studied and are described in the following section.

A wide spectrum of health effects have been associated with exposure to ETS. These effects include mucous membrane
irritation, decrease in respiratory system performance, adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, reproductive
effects, and cancer. The following section also presents more detailed information on these health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether a chemical elicits toxicity or not depends not only on its inherent potency and site specificity but also on
how the human system can metabolize and excrete that particular chemical. To produce health effects, the constituents
of ETS must be absorbed and must be present in appropriate concentration at the sites of action. After absorption,
some of these contaminants are metabolized to less toxic metabolites while some carcinogens are activated by metabolism
in the body. Available biomarkers of ETS, such as nicotine, clearly show that nonsmoker exposure is of sufficient
magnitude to be absorbed and to result in measurable levels of these biomarkers. There is sufficient evidence in the
literature to indicate that several components of sidestream smoke are rapidly absorbed and widely distributed
within the body. However, the extent of absorption, distribution, retention and metabolism of these contaminants
in the body depends upon various physiological and pharmacokinetic parameters that are influenced by gender, race,
age and smoking habits of the exposed individuals. These parameters and others may result in differences in susceptibility
among exposed subpopulations. Nicotine is one of the most widely studied constituents of tobacco smoke. There have
been numerous studies on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine in both animals and man.

(a) Absorption and distribution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Absorption and distribution of tobacco smoke constituents are usually measured by using surrogate markers. A correlation
between nicotine absorption and exposure to tobacco smoke has between demonstrated, thus making nicotine an appropriate
marker for tobacco smoke in pharmacokinetic studies. The steady state volume of distribution for nicotine is large
indicating that it is widely distributed within the body [Ex. 4&hyph;185]. Nicotine has been shown to bind with plasma
proteins which may interfere with elimination and thereby prolong retention in the body. The studies in the docket
clearly indicate that nicotine and other constituents of tobacco smoke are readily absorbed and distributed throughout
the body thereby increasing the potential of producing adverse effects at more then one target site.

(b) Metabolism. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nicotine is rapidly eliminated, primarily via metabolism and urinary excretion. The investigation of metabolism

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has resulted in the identification of more than 20 metabolic products in the plasma and urine of humans and animals.
The principle metabolic pathways of nicotine appear to involve oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to yield nicotine-1
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-N-oxide and cotinine, the latter being the major metabolite and the precursor of many of the metabolic products
of nicotine. Some of the metabolites detected in the urine of rats after intravenous administration in a study by Kyerematen
et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;185] are listed in Table II&hyph;1. In humans, cotinine is the major degradation product of nicotine
metabolism and has a serum half-life of about 17 hours compared to two hours for the parent compound, nicotine [Exs.
4&hyph;27, 4&hyph;253]. Trans-3
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-hydroxycotinine in the free form constitutes the largest single metabolite in smokers' urine accounting
for 35&hyph;40% of the urinary nicotine metabolite [Exs. 4&hyph;48, 4&hyph;241]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smokers and nonsmokers differ in their metabolism of nicotine and cotinine [Exs. 4&hyph;133, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;279].
The half-life values for urinary elimination of nicotine and cotinine were found to be significantly shorter in smokers
than nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;186]. Plasma nicotine clearance was faster in smokers than in nonsmokers in this study.
More rapid elimination of nicotine and cotinine has been attributed to the inductive effects of chronic cigarette
smoking on the hepatic metabolism of many xenobiotic agents. However, Benowitz et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;29] were unable
to confirm published research suggesting that smokers metabolize nicotine and cotinine more rapidly than nonsmokers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Variations in nicotine metabolism occur among individuals. Variations also occur due to differences in gender and
race [Exs. 4&hyph;26, 4&hyph;186, 4&hyph;314]. It has also been suggested that the metabolism of nicotine between
smokers and nonsmokers may differ. Male smokers have been shown to metabolize nicotine faster than do female smokers
after intravenous infusion of nicotine and active smoking. However, this difference was not observed by Benowitz
and Jacob [Ex. 4&hyph;23] during a study of daily intake of nicotine in smokers versus nonsmokers. The metabolism
of nicotine has also been studied in animals. Male rats (4 strains) were shown to metabolize nicotine faster than did
females [Ex. 4&hyph;185].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the potential effect of nicotine, and other ETS constituents in the body, is governed by interactions
between several physiological and pharmacokinetics parameters. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interactions may lead to longer retention of toxic constituents, thus prolonging the effects on the target organs
resulting in tissue injury.

Exposure to ETS is capable of inducing eye and upper respiratory tract irritation. Common chemical sense or irritation
perception is mediated through receptors in the fifth, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves. These receptors are found
throughout the nasal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal areas of the respiratory system and also on the surface of the eyes
[Ex. 4&hyph;239]. It is partially through the stimulation of these receptors that exposed persons perceive irritation.

The ability of tobacco smoke to elicit irritation may be enhanced by low relative humidity and varies according to
concentration [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. Irritating components of ETS are contained in both the vapor phase and the particulate
phase (see Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7). These effects have been studied in both experimental (e.g., animals
studies; clinical and chamber studies on humans) and field (e.g., surveys and epidemiological studies) studies.
The NRC report [Ex. 4&hyph;239] summarized these studies and concluded that even though the specific components
of ETS that cause irritation were not identified, the overall effects were eye and throat irritation and immunological
responses. Weber [Ex. 4&hyph;317] reported the results of a field study that included 44 workrooms where smoking
was taking place. Eye irritation was reported by 52 out of 167 workers. Nonsmokers reacted more than smokers to the
ETS; 36 of the 52 workers who reported eye irritation at work were nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;317]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asano et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;18] reported significant eye irritation, as measured by blinking rates, in both healthy
smoking and nonsmoking adults following exposure to ETS. Nonsmokers reported more eye irritation than smokers did.
Effects such as eye irritation and nasal stuffiness were reported to OSHA in comments to the docket [Exs. 3&hyph;38,
3&hyph;58, 3&hyph;59, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;438D, 3&hyph;440A].

3. Pulmonary Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Much of the literature relevant to the association between non-cancerous health effects and ETS has focused on children.
Because children are undergoing development and maturation, they are not physiologically equivalent to adults
exposed to the same conditions. Therefore, findings in studies conducted with respect to ETS and children may not
be directly applicable to adults. However, a number of studies have investigated the relationship between ETS and
pulmonary health effects in adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies which are restricted to adults vary by numerous factors, such as the population studied, the measures used
to estimate exposure to ETS, and the physiologic and health outcomes examined. The studies also varied in the consideration
of potential confounders. A number of studies have found relationships between ETS exposure and pulmonary health
effects. These studies have: (1) used pulmonary function tests, which may be more sensitive than methods used in other
studies, to detect physiological changes occurring in the small airways of the lungs (e.g., forced mid-expiratory
flow rate (FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
25&hyph;75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and forced end-expiratory flow rate (FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
75&hyph;85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)); (2) studied older populations with a longer history of exposure to ETS; (3) stratified the level of ETS exposure
with significant findings more likely to occur in persons with higher exposures; and (4) more frequently found significant
changes in lung function in men, although adverse pulmonary effects to ETS have also been shown in women. The following
discussion summarizes the results of these studies [Exs. 4&hyph;18, 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;62, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;173,
4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;180, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;278, 4&hyph;295, 4&hyph;321].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Asano et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;18] demonstrated the acute physiologic changes which occur as a result of exposure to ETS.
Nonsmokers had more pronounced changes in eye blinking rates (a measure of eye irritation), expired carbon monoxide,
increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies of ETS and chronic health effects in adults differ by how they define ``never smokers'', ``exsmokers'', and
how other various levels of ETS exposure are defined, either in nominal, ordinal or interval scales; and whether or
not they take into account exposure both in the workplace and at home. The potential for misclassification bias occurs
when ``nonsmokers'' are loosely defined and used as the comparative group to passive smokers. Several studies considered
the confounding impact of environmental air pollution [Ex. 4&hyph;278], indoor cooking fuels [Exs. 4&hyph;37,
4&hyph;62] or occupational exposures to dusts and fumes [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210,
4&hyph;321]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been fewer longitudinal studies [Exs. 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;278, 4&hyph;295] as compared to the majority
which have been cross-sectional studies. The duration of exposure, which is critical to producing a measurable health
effect, was quantified by number of years directly in several studies [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;173,
4&hyph;295, 4&hyph;321], or indirectly by the age of the population under study [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210].
In those studies which had carefully assessed for level of exposure and had specified a duration of at least 10 years,
significant pulmonary function decrements were noted in both men and women [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;148, 4 176, 4&hyph;321].
Overall, changes in pulmonary indices are more likely to occur in men than in women, however, several studies have
documented statistically significant physiological changes in pulmonary function occurring in women [Exs. 4&hyph;37,
4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;321]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Understanding the significance of findings is complicated because studies used a variety of measures from spirometry.
Although most studies evaluated FVC (forced vital capacity) and FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (forced expiratory volume in one second), fewer studies have measured FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
25&hyph;75 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
75&hyph;85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;180, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;321]. These later measures have been suggested
as being more sensitive to detecting changes in the small airways where effects of ETS are most likely to occur [Exs.
4&hyph;46, 4&hyph;216, 4&hyph;230, 4&hyph;231]. However, there is no clear consensus in the medical literature
as to the routine clinical use of FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
25&hyph;75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
75&hyph;85,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or their diagnostic value in independently detecting small airway disease [Ex. 4&hyph;8]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates of the decrement in FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 due to ETS exposure in passive smokers as compared to never smokers, ranges from 80 milliliters (ml) [Ex. 4&hyph;148]
to 190 ml [Ex. 4&hyph;37]. When this decrement is expressed as a percent of FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it has been estimated to be 5.7% in males, or 7.3% when these same subjects were matched for age [Ex. 4&hyph;210]. As
a means of comparison, the average loss in lung volume per year due to aging alone is estimated to be 25 to 30 ml [Ex. 4&hyph;329].
The American Thoracic Society [Ex. 4&hyph;8] specifies that spirometry equipment have a level of accuracy within
50 ml. Since pulmonary function maneuvers are very effort dependent, intra-individual variation between the three
best efforts should be within 5% to be acceptable. The importance of these spirometry criteria is emphasized by the
fact that the FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may result in being 100 to 200 ml lower than when a maximal effort is given by the subject. Furthermore, a decrease of
15% must be achieved before certain pulmonary indices are considered outside of normal limits. Given this perspective,
although changes in pulmonary function tests may truly occur as a result of exposure to ETS over a number of years, the
actual clinical impact may not be apparent in the healthy, young individual. Older individuals and those with preexisting
pulmonary disease are more susceptible to the pulmonary effects of exposure to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outside of respiratory changes being documented through pulmonary function testing, other symptoms have been found
to be significantly associated with ETS exposure. Hole et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;148] found a significant increase in the
prevalence of infected sputum, persistent sputum, dyspnea and hypersecretion in passive smokers as compared to
controls. Furthermore, rates increased as those exposed were stratified by level of exposure to passive smoke from
low to high. Kauffmann et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;178] noted a significant increased risk for dyspnea in American (Odds Ratio
(OR)=1.42) and French women (OR=1.43), and an increased risk for wheeze in American women (OR=1.36). Schwartz and
Zeger [Ex. 4&hyph;278] found an increased risk for phlegm or sputum in a 3-year longitudinal study (OR=1.41). This
risk was raised to 1.76 when asthmatics, who may be medicated, were excluded from the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As small airway disease progresses to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (also referred to as chronic
obstructive lung disease (COLD)), the impact of ETS becomes more detectable. Kalandidi et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;173] reported
an adjusted odds ratio of 2.5 (90% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.3 to 5.0) for Greek women never smokers exposed to their
husbands' tobacco smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there is a clear trend, and in several studies a statistically significant finding of a demonstrated decrease
in pulmonary function indices, or an increase in respiratory symptoms in passive smokers, the impairment nonsmokers
suffer by the exposure may not be immediately obvious. It is important to note that these findings have been demonstrated
in otherwise healthy individuals. Based upon the finding of White and Froeb [Ex. 4&hyph;321], Fielding and Phenow
[Ex. 4&hyph;102] have described such changes as being equivalent to those found in light smokers, who smoke from 1
to 10 cigarettes per day. Where a decrease of 100 to 200 ml of FVC or FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be clinically insignificant in healthy persons, such a change may be significant for workers with already impaired
pulmonary function [Exs. 3&hyph;438D, 3&hyph;440A, 4&hyph;76, 4&hyph;182]. These changes may be the pivotal point
at which a worker becomes unable to continue to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Cellular effects on the pulmonary tissue have also been observed in animals exposed to ETS during experimental studies.
Several studies reviewed by OSHA have demonstrated that chronic cigarette smoke exposure produces an accumulation
of alveolar macrophages (AM) (the presence of AM indicates a body's response to environmental insults), within the
respiratory bronchioles of many animals species. This effect is similar to that seen in human smokers [Exs. 4&hyph;31,
4&hyph;58, 4&hyph;109, 4&hyph;110, 4&hyph;140, 4&hyph;147, 4&hyph;150, 4&hyph;179, 4&hyph;212, 4&hyph;249].
Increased elastase secretion by alveolar macrophages from mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke has also
been observed [Ex. 4&hyph;322]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) is also an indication of the body's response to environmental
insults. PMNs were found in the alveolar septum of cigarette smoke-exposed hamsters, similar to the PMNs observed
in the lungs of human smokers [Ex. 4&hyph;204]. In contrast to the focal nature of the alveolar macrophages accumulation,
the accumulation of PMN is diffuse. Studies of PMN leukocyte function have not been systematically evaluated in smoke-exposed
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other studies also show effects of ETS exposure at the cellular level. For example, young lambs exposed to ETS for one
month did not develop detectable pulmonary system effects or alteration in lung mechanics or airway responsiveness.
However, the lambs did develop inflammation of pulmonary cells [Ex. 4&hyph;290]. A cytotoxic effect of tobacco smoke
was also demonstrated by decreased intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in guinea pig alveolar macrophages
and lowered cell bacteriocidal activity in a study by Firlik [Ex. 4&hyph;104]).

Exposure to tobacco smoke has been shown to increase the permeability of the respiratory epithelial membrane to macromolecules.
Burns et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;45] have shown that exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran
(FITC&hyph;D, molecular weight 10,000) increased the amount of intact FITC&hyph;D that crossed the respiratory
epithelium into the vascular space. Transmission electron-microscopic studies showed that the FITC&hyph;D diffused
across damaged type I pneumocyte membranes and cytoplasm to reach the basal lamina and entered the alveolar capillaries
through the endothelial junction. Damage to alveolar epithelium was more frequent for the smoke-exposed animals
than the room air-exposed animals.

Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) participates in the activation of various carcinogens, such as benzo(a)pyrene.
This is one of the many carcinogens found in ETS. Both mainstream and sidestream smoke are capable of inducing pulmonary
AHH activity. Gairola [Ex. 114] has demonstrated the induction of pulmonary AHH activity in Sprague-Dawley rats
and male C57BL mice after exposure to either mainstream or sidestream smoke from University of Kentucky Reference
cigarettes (2R1) for seven days per week for 16 weeks. However, no such induction was noted in Hartley guinea-pigs
under similar conditions, indicating a species difference. The mainstream and the sidestream smoke were equally
effective in inducing the AHH activity.

There is consistent evidence that decrements in pulmonary function and increases in respiratory symptoms occur
in current smokers and in exsmokers. However, in passive smokers these health effects are not as easily demonstrated.
The Environmental Protection Agency's December 1992 report, Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung
Cancer and Other Disorders [Ex. 4&hyph;311], reviewed an abundance of evidence showing persistent physiologic
changes in children's respiratory function and related health effects as a result of exposure to ETS. Studies evaluating
these same effects are not as plentiful in adults. However, the EPA concluded, ``recent evidence suggests that passive
smoking has subtle but statistically significant effects on the respiratory health of adults'' [Ex. 4&hyph;311].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The weight of the evidence shows that exposure to ETS results in decreases in pulmonary function indices and increases
in respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy men and women who are exposed to ETS for periods of 10 or more years. The
risk of developing COPD appears to be increased in passive smokers with lifelong exposures to ETS. Whether these changes
impact upon respiratory function to a degree that impairment occurs may be dependent upon the individual's pulmonary
status and overall health condition.

4. Cardiovascular Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A developing body of research indicates that the cardiovascular effects of ETS exposure on the health of nonsmokers
include acute effects, such as exacerbation of angina, as well as chronic effects, such as atherosclerosis [Exs.
4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;291, 4&hyph;330]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cardiovascular diseases [Exs. 4&hyph;91, 4&hyph;136] such as myocardial infarction [Ex. 4&hyph;12], sudden death,
and arterial thrombosis occur more frequently in cigarette smokers as opposed to nonsmokers [Exs. 4&hyph;86, 4&hyph;233].
The same chemicals which produce these effects in active smokers are present in ETS. These include nicotine, carbon
monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tobacco glycoproteins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion on cardiovascular effects covers thrombus formation, vascular wall injury and the possible
mechanisms of these effects in nonsmokers. Discussion of the acute and chronic health effects follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Thrombus Formation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Blood clots in the coronary arteries are an important component of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). An additional
component of the acute MI is the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the walls of the coronary arteries. Platelets
are involved in both the acute formation of blood clots and the chronic formation of atherosclerotic plaques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is evidence that ETS exposure can cause platelets to become more easily activated thus predisposing the platelets
to become involved in forming clots and atherosclerotic plaques. For example, evidence exists that demonstrates
that the platelets of nonsmokers exposed to ETS are more easily activated [Exs. 4&hyph;40, 4&hyph;80]. The study
by Burghuber [Exs. 4&hyph;40] demonstrates that the platelet activating capabilities of ETS are more prominent
in nonsmokers than in smokers. The results of this study suggest that nonsmokers are at a greater risk of blood clot
formation secondary to ETS exposure than smokers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acute ETS exposure also results in an increased platelet aggregation, which is an initial stage of the development
of coronary thrombosis or vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction can lead to the development of coronary atherosclerosis
after chronic exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;111, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;272]. Environmental smoke exposure also can increase
platelet-activating factor (PAF), platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinogen concentration which
provides a marker of its effect on coronary heart disease [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;157, 4&hyph;224].

(b) Vascular Wall Injury. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Atherosclerotic plaque formation is a complicated chronic process that can lead to constriction of the lumen of the
blood vessels, resulting in reduced blood supply to the myocardial tissues. It is thought that an essential step in
plaque formation is injury to the endothelial lining of the arterial wall. ETS has been implicated in causing injury
to the endothelial cells which line the arterial walls. This was demonstrated in the study by Davis et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;80]
which identified an increase in the number of endothelial cell carcasses in the circulation of healthy people after
being exposed to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ETS has also been implicated in stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and in altering blood lipids. Each of
these can contribute to plaque formation which leads to an increased susceptibility to heart attacks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(c) Possible Mechanisms of Effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At least three mechanisms are described in the literature by which ETS may place stress on the heart by increasing myocardial
oxygen demand, decreasing myocardial oxygen supply or interfering with the cell's ability to utilize oxygen for
energy production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One mechanism by which ETS may reduce oxygen supply is through the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin
is formed when a person is exposed to carbon monoxide, a component of ETS. The carbon monoxide effectively competes
with oxygen for the heme group of the hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell (RBC). In fact, carbon monoxide has a
much greater affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen and binds very strongly with hemoglobin making it unavailable
for the transport of oxygen. The heart muscle (myocardium) can experience injury at the cellular level when the oxygen
demanded by the heart muscle exceeds the oxygen supplied by the blood. Therefore, the formation of carboxyhemoglobin
can decrease the ability of the blood to deliver oxygen to the myocardium and can cause injury to the heart if myocardial
oxygen demand exceeds supply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of studies have suggested that ETS exposure adversely affects the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship;
this would predispose the heart to develop ischemia or exacerbate preexisting ischemia. Direct or indirect exposure
to tobacco smoke has been shown to increase the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen demand [Exs. 4&hyph;13,
4&hyph;242] at the same time that it potentially reduces both myocardial oxygen supply and delivery by enhancing
the development of coronary atherosclerosis [Exs. 4&hyph;242, 4&hyph;323], causing coronary vasoconstriction
[Exs. 4&hyph;323, 4&hyph;324] and reducing the oxygen carrying capacity of blood through increased carboxyhemoglobin
levels [Ex. 4&hyph;13]. As a result, fewer red blood cells are available to transport oxygen to the body, and to the
heart muscle itself. To compensate for this reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, the heart must work harder,
for example, by increasing the heart rate. This is an example of one mechanism by which ETS may place even further stress
on the heart by increasing myocardial oxygen demand, precisely at a time when the oxygen delivery capabilities of
the blood are reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second mechanism by which ETS may increase myocardial oxygen demand is via the direct effect of nicotine. The nicotine
in ETS may cause an increased resting heart rate and blood pressure in exposed individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One study examined the effects of ETS on healthy individuals during exercise, and found that healthy individuals
experienced fatigue at lower work levels when exercising in the presence of ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;123]. The authors concluded
that ETS exposure interfered with the heart muscle cells' ability to utilize oxygen for energy production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, ETS exposure may have an adverse impact on myocardial metabolism and expose the heart muscle to an increased
susceptibility to injury. These mechanisms of cardiac stress and potential injury to the heart are in agreement with
accepted theories of cardiac injury.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(d) Acute Heart Effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An acute effect of exposure to ETS is the aggravation of existing heart conditions, such as angina. The National Research
Council (1986) reported, based on the effects of studies by Anderson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;9] and Aronow et al. [Exs. 4&hyph;14,
4&hyph;16, 4&hyph;17], that angina patients are especially sensitive at carboxyhemoglobin levels between 2 and
4%. Guerin et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;129] report that physiologically adverse effects occur in humans at 2.5% carboxyhemoglobin
blood content. Cumulative carbon monoxide levels, due to ETS that result in such an effect are not uncommon in work
environments [Ex. 4&hyph;129]. Acute exposure to ETS has been reported to increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure,
and increase carboxyhemoglobin levels in both angina patients [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 4&hyph;222] and in healthy subjects
[Exs. 4&hyph;18, 4&hyph;217]. Acute exposure has also been associated with slight changes in blood components thought
to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as endothelial cell count, platelet aggregate ratio,
and platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin [Exs. 4&hyph;40, 4&hyph;80]. Many effects of ETS exposure, such as ischemia,
may be additionally aggravated by simultaneous exposure to other compounds, such as solvents [Exs. 3&hyph;446,
4&hyph;99].

(e) Chronic Heart Effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The occurrence of coronary heart disease in ETS-exposed nonsmokers has been studied by various epidemiological
researchers [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;120, 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;139, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;154,
4&hyph;191, 4&hyph;277, 4&hyph;295]. Small, but statistically significant (at p &gt; 0.05), increases in coronary
heart disease mortality [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;139, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;277] indicate a modest impact
of long-term ETS tobacco smoke exposure on the cardiovascular health of nonsmokers. The relative risks calculated
in these studies ranged from 1.3 to 2.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of ETS exposure to induce coronary heart disease has also been studied in animals. Zhu et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;330]
exposed rats to ETS and showed a dose-related increase in myocardial infarct size and a decrease in bleeding time.
But there were no significant differences in serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein and cholesterol. This
study showed that air nicotine, carbon monoxide, and total particulate concentrations increased with ETS exposure,
and this increased exposure led to a continuous increase in plasma carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine levels
in ETS-exposed rats. There was a positive relationship between the infarct size and air nicotine, carbon monoxide,
total particulate concentrations and plasma carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine levels. The average concentrations
of air nicotine, carbon monoxide and particulates, according to the authors, were 30-fold, 3-fold and 10- fold higher,
respectively, than in a heavy smoking environment. The duration of exposure, however, was short compared to even
a rat's lifetime. Infarct size nearly doubled following only 180 hours of ETS exposure distributed over a six week
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the same study, the effect of ETS exposure on platelet function and aortic and pulmonary artery atherosclerosis
in New Zealand male rabbits was demonstrated. The increase of atherosclerosis after exposure to ETS was shown to be
independent of changes in serum lipids and exhibited a dose-response relationship in this study. Average air nicotine,
carbon monoxide and total particulate concentrations were 1,040 &mu;g/m3, 60.2 ppm and 32.8 mg/m3 for high dose group
and 30 &mu;g/m3, 18.8 ppm and 4.0 mg/m3 for low dose group and &lt;1 &mu;g/m3, 3.1 ppm and 0.13 mg/m3 for the control group.
Atherosclerosis in this study was significantly increased in the high dose group.

Olsen [Ex. 245] exposed rats daily to smoke from University of Kentucky 2R1 Reference cigarettes for 10 minutes, 7
times a week for 4, 8 or 20 weeks. Sidestream (SS) smoke was collected by a moving column of air spiked every minute with
a puff of fresh mainstream (MS) smoke. Rats were exposed to this SS smoke collected in a 2 L/min air flow using a glass
container placed over a burning cigarette. A fraction of this air flow containing SS smoke was diluted with fresh room
air and continuously diverted to the rats as follows: 50%, 25% and 10% SS smoke. Carboxyhemoglobin content for each
treatment group was determined immediately after the last smoke exposure and percent carboxyhemoglobin for each
group was found to be: 4 week exposure-mainstream=7.2

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Research has shown that passive exposure to tobacco smoke damages endothelial cells and increases the number of circulating
anuclear carcasses of endothelial cells [Ex. 4&hyph;80]. ETS appears to alter cardiac cellular metabolism in such
a way that renders the myocyte less capable of producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Reduced oxidative phosphorylation
in cardiac mitochondrial fractions taken from rabbits exposed to ETS has been demonstrated [Ex. 4&hyph;130]. Studies
have indicated that the reduction in mitochondrial respiration secondary to ETS exposure is likely due to decreased
cytochrome oxidase activity [Exs. 4&hyph;130, 4&hyph;131]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nicotine, a component of tobacco smoke, has been shown in in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vitro 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
studies, to inhibit the release of prostacyclin, through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, from the rings of rabbit
or rat aorta. Nicotine could also affect platelets by releasing catecholamines which lead to increased thromboxane
A2 [Ex. 4&hyph;25]. Passive smoke also increases blood viscosity and hematocrit due to relative hypoxia induced
by chronic carbon monoxide exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;25]. Nicotine, contained in cigarette smoke can lead to catecholamine
release, which enhances platelet adhesiveness and decreases the ventricular fibrillation threshold. This threshold
is also affected by carbon monoxide levels [Exs. 4&hyph;25, 4&hyph;196]. Cigarette smoke also increases the lipolysis
that increases levels of plasma free fatty acids, which result in enhanced synthesis of LDL [Ex. 4&hyph;234]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, there are multiple pathways by which ETS may damage the heart. ETS exposure has been demonstrated to
both increase myocardial oxygen demand and decrease myocardial oxygen supply. If oxygen demand exceeds supply for
a long enough period of time, then myocardial cell injury or even cell death can occur. In addition, ETS exposure may
cause platelets to become less sensitive to the anti-clotting regulatory substances in the blood and therefore increase
the tendency of the blood to clot. An increased tendency for the blood to clot may lead to an increased susceptibility
to heart attacks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ETS exposure may also contribute to the chronic formation of arterial wall plaques which are implicated in the event
of an acute myocardial infarction. The two mechanisms described by which ETS exposure may stimulate plaque formation
are endothelial cell injury and increased platelet activation. Different people will have different abilities
to deal with the increased stress on the heart and the increased tendency of the blood to clot as a result of ETS exposure.
For example, a young, otherwise healthy individual may be able to tolerate short-term ETS exposure without apparent
difficulty, although asymptomatic arterial wall injury may occur which can contribute to cardiac injury in the future.
However, an older person with pre-existing coronary artery disease and therefore minimum cardiac reserve may not
be able to tolerate short-term ETS exposure, due to the increased stress on the heart.

5. Reproductive Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data on the reproductive effects due to the exposure of nonsmoking pregnant women to ETS has been presented in many
studies [Exs. 3&hyph;438, 4&hyph;92, 4&hyph;132, 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;208, 4&hyph;273, 4&hyph;285, 4&hyph;287,
4&hyph;299]. This is important since many nonsmoking women continue to work throughout their pregnancies. Pregnant
women working in indoor environments without tobacco smoking restrictions, as in restaurants, comprise one of the
most heavily ETS-exposed groups [Exs. 4&hyph;151, 4&hyph;287]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low birthweight has also been shown to be associated with paternal smoking, implying passive exposure to tobacco
smoke by the nonsmoking mother [Exs. 4&hyph;92, 4&hyph;273]. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke is estimated to double
the risk of low birthweight in a full-term baby [Ex. 4&hyph;208]. Nonsmoking pregnant women who are exposed to ETS
have been reported to deliver neonates that range 24 to 120 grams lighter in weight than those babies delivered by nonexposed
pregnant women [Exs. 4&hyph;132, 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;208, 4&hyph;273]. This relationship between passive smoking
and low birthweight remains statistically significant even after accounting for mother's age, parity, social class,
sex of baby, and alcohol consumption. This effect is more apparent in neonates born to actively smoking women who deliver
babies that weigh, on average, 200 grams less than those of nonsmoking women [Ex. 4&hyph;101]. The reduction in birthweight
is clinically significant at the low end of the birthweight distribution. These infants have higher perinatal mortality
[Ex. 4&hyph;239]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other reproductive effects that have been ascribed to maternal ETS exposure include miscarriage, an increase in
congenital abnormalities [Exs. 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;299], and numerous other physiological effects [Ex. 4&hyph;297].
It was reported that these effects may be part of a general immunosuppressive condition associated with the occurrence
of low birthweight [Ex. 4&hyph;299]. This effect may predispose the baby to respiratory tract infections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects of environmental smoke exposure on the fetus may have long-term sequelae into childhood and adulthood
[Exs. 4&hyph;53, 4&hyph;181, 4&hyph;213, 4&hyph;225, 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;51, 4&hyph;297]. There is limited evidence
which suggests that growth retardation observed in the fetus is reflected in the growing child as reductions in lung
development [3&hyph;438]. This is especially relevant if that child continues to be exposed to ETS throughout childhood
and into adulthood [Exs. 4&hyph;177, 4&hyph;297]. Prenatal exposure to ETS and exposure to ETS as a child may also
increase an individual's cancer risk, perhaps by a factor of two (2) [Exs. 4&hyph;65, 4&hyph;164, 4&hyph;252]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experimental research on the adverse reproductive effects associated with ETS exposure in animals is limited. However,
one study [Ex. 4&hyph;6] demonstrated such effects. Sciatic nerve tissue taken from the offspring of ETS-exposed
female mice revealed definite toxic effects on the neonatal tissue [Ex. 4&hyph;6]. Pregnant female mice (C57BL/KsJ)
were exposed to low-tar cigarette smoke in a special smoking chamber. Cigarette smoke was blown into the chamber for
4 minutes, 5 times daily, except on weekends when this was done 3 times daily. At 18 days of gestation, blood samples
were taken and carbon monoxide levels were measured. Ultrastructural abnormalities of fetal tissue revealed swollen
mitochondria with distorted cristae, some indication of deformed mitochondria, darkened nuclei with condensations
of nuclear material, lamellar bodies, granules and myelin bodies similar to those found in human toxicity studies.
The blood samples from pregnant mice revealed a mean carbon monoxide saturation in the hemoglobin of 9% which is equivalent
to that found in humans who actively smoke 10&hyph;20 cigarettes per day.

Concern over the carcinogenic effects of ETS was expressed in many comments submitted to the docket, such as Exs. 3&hyph;32,
3&hyph;35, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;207, 3&hyph;438, 3&hyph;440A, and 3&hyph;449. The results of epidemiological and
experimental studies indicate that exposure to ETS is causally associated with cancer of the lung in chronically-exposed
nonsmokers. A discussion of this evidence follows.

(a) Evidence of Association._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of epidemiological studies taken in the aggregate suggest that nonsmoker exposure to ETS is causally-related
to the development of lung cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of specificity of effect is provided by active smoking studies that report a causal association with lung
cancer [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. It was therefore logical to examine nonsmokers with passive exposure to tobacco smoke,
since the chemicals found in passive smoke are qualitatively similar to those in mainstream smoke. Active smoking
induces all four major histological types of human lung cancer_squamous-cell carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas,
large-cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. The results of lung cancer studies that examined
the variation in tumor cell type induced by ETS exposure indicate that mostly adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas
are produced by ETS exposure. Some studies have reported an excess of adenocarcinomas, while others have reported
excesses in squamous cell and small-cell carcinomas. From this information, it is apparent that similar tumor cell
types are induced by ETS exposure as are induced by active smoking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unequivocal causal association between active tobacco smoking and lung cancer in humans, as well as the corroborative
evidence of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke provided by animal bioassays and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
studies and the chemical similarity between mainstream smoke and ETS, clearly establish the plausibility that ETS
is also a human lung carcinogen (Table II&hyph;2). In addition, biomarker studies verify that ETS exposure results
in detectable uptake of tobacco constituents by nonsmokers [Exs. 4&hyph;50, 4&hyph;311].

(b) Epidemiological and Experimental Studies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There are at least 32 epidemiological studies that have attempted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ETS.
OSHA analyzed these studies and determined that 14 were positive for an association [Exs. 4&hyph;36, 4&hyph;65,
4&hyph;106, 4&hyph;119, 4&hyph;121, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;143, 4&hyph;153, 4&hyph;158, 4&hyph;187, 4&hyph;252,
4&hyph;275, 4&hyph;276, 4&hyph;292, 4&hyph;300], 5 were equivocal with a positive trend [Exs. 4&hyph;4, 4&hyph;47,
4&hyph;117, 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;171], and 13 were equivocal [Exs. 4&hyph;35, 4&hyph;38, 4&hyph;52, 4&hyph;118,
4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;164, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;183, 4&hyph;192, 4&hyph;283, 4&hyph;286, 4&hyph;296, 4&hyph;326].
[See the Risk Assessment section for further discussion.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA considered the consistency of the association to determine if the finding of the same exposure effect occurred
in different populations and different types of studies. The great number of epidemiological studies available
on ETS were conducted by different researchers, on different populations, in various countries with diverse study
designs. This extensive amount of data increases confidence that the associations seen between ETS exposure and
the development of lung cancer is externally consistent and is not due to artifacts or a product of some unidentified,
indirect factors unlikely to be common to all of the studies. The fact that exposure to ETS is common dilutes the risk
estimates derived from these studies because the comparison group has some exposure to ETS. A recent Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) report [Ex. 4&hyph;50] found that 100% of a subset of the National Health and Nutrition
Evaluation Survey (NHANES) III conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics had detectable levels of cotinine
in their bodies indicating that everyone in the sample had detectable exposure to tobacco smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;50].
Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine and is used as a surrogate of exposure to tobacco smoke. This indicates that the
cancer risk may indeed be greater since the relationship in these studies has been more exposed versus less exposed
instead of exposed versus nonexposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many potential sources of bias, such as publication bias (the tendency of scientific journals to publish studies
with positive results), misclassification bias (smokers or former smokers claiming to be nonsmokers), and recall
bias (the reliance on self-reporting of both personal smoking habits and exposure to others' tobacco smoke) can not
account for the elevation in risks seen in these various studies. Also, the relative risks that were estimated from
prospective study data are similar to those estimated from case/control study data. Biases that may be problematic
to case-control studies are not a problem in prospective studies. Since the results from both types of studies are
similar it is apparent that these biases are not important in the case-control studies (e.g., misclassification
bias and recall bias). This information strengthens the confidence of a causal connection.

Animal studies have shown the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke. Limited existing data suggest that sidestream
smoke may contain more carcinogenic activity per milligram of cigarette smoke concentrate than does mainstream
smoke [Ex. 3&hyph;689D]. Currently, OSHA is aware of only a few experimental inhalation studies with sidestream
smoke or ETS reported in the literature. A discussion of these studies follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Otto and Elmenhorst [Ex. 4&hyph;247] have shown that there are carcinogenic constituents in the vapor phase of tobacco
smoke. They exposed C57B1 and BLH mice to the gas phase of cigarette mainstream smoke of 12 cigarettes for 90 minutes
daily over 27 months. The particulate matter was removed by passing the smoke through a Cambridge filter. The percentages
of mice with lung adenomas were 5.5% and 32% in the smoke-exposed C57B1 and BLH mice, as compared to 3.4% and 22% for their
respective controls. Leuchtenberger and Leuchtenberger [Ex. 4&hyph;197] have also shown that the rate of tumors
among mice exposed to the gas phase was greater than animals exposed to the whole smoke. Pulmonary adenomas and adenocarcinomas
were induced in Snell's mice by the gas phase but not by the whole smoke in this study. These studies demonstrate that
the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke is not limited to the particulate phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have also reported hyperplasia and metaplasia in the trachea and bronchi of mice exposed to cigarette smoke
by the inhalation route [Exs. 4&hyph;226, 4&hyph;327]. Four lung tumors and emphysema were detected in 100 male and
female C57B1 mice exposed, nose only, to fresh mainstream smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;135]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pulmonary squamous neoplasms were detected in female Wistar rats exposed to a 1:5 smoke-to-air mixture for 15 seconds
of every minute during an 11 minute exposure twice a day, 5 days per week, for the lifespan of the animals [Ex. 4&hyph;79].
Respiratory tumors were also observed in Fischer&hyph;344 rats exposed, nose only, to a 1:10 smoke to air mixture
for approximately 30 seconds every minute, 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 128 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;77]. The incidence
of laryngeal leukoplakias in Syrian golden hamsters ranged from 11.3% for the animals that received the low dose to
30.6% of those animals that received the highest dose. These animals were exposed to a 1:7 smoke-to-air mixture for
10 to 30 minutes, 5 days a week, nose only, for a period of up to 52 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;88]. Exposing hamsters twice a day,
5 days a week for up to 100 weeks resulted in almost 90% of the exposed hamsters having hyperplastic or neoplastic changes
in the larynx in a study by Bernfeld et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;30]. Lung tumors have been reported in beagle dogs exposed to
the smoke from nonfilter cigarettes [Ex. 4&hyph;19]. However, no tumors were seen in rabbits exposed to cigarette
smoke for up to 51/2 years [Ex. 4&hyph;149]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sidestream condensates have also been shown to cause carcinogenicity when implanted into female Osborne-Mendel
rat lungs [Ex. 4&hyph;127]. Cigarette smoke condensate fraction from sidestream smoke was implanted at a dose level
of one cigarette per animal in this study.

Coggins et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;59] reported epithelial hyperplasia in the nasal cavity of high-dosed rats exposed to
environmental tobacco smoke. They exposed Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, nose only, to ``aged and diluted sidestream
smoke'' (ADSS) at 0.1, 1 or 10 mg of particulates per meter for 14 days and found ``slight to mild'' epithelial hyperplasia
and inflammation in the most rostral part of the nasal cavity in the 10 mg group only. They also found that these changes
were reversible if the animals were kept without further exposure for an additional 14 days. No effects in the lung
were reported. Similar results of mild hyperplasia were also obtained when male rats were exposed to the same concentrations
for up to 13 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;60]. In this study the authors reported hypercellularity and the thickening of the respiratory
epithelium of the dorsal nasal conchae and adjacent wall of the middle meatus.

Rats are obligatory nose-breathers, and the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory tract and the biochemistry
of the lung differ between rodents and humans. Because of these distinctions, laboratory animals and humans are likely
to have different deposition and exposure patterns for the various cigarette smoke components in the respiratory
system. For example, rodents have extensive and complex nasal turbinates where significant particle deposition
could occur, decreasing exposure to the lung. These anatomical and physiological differences, aside from the subchronic
exposure, may partially account for absence of any lung tumors in the study by Coggins et al.

The application of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) to mouse skin is a widely employed assay for the evaluation of
carcinogenic potential. CSC assays may not, however, reveal all of the carcinogenic activity of actual cigarette
smoke, because these condensates lack most of the volatile and semi-volatile components of whole smoke. Benign skin
tumors and carcinomas were seen in Swiss-ICR mice exposed to cigarette tar from the sidestream smoke of nonfilter
cigarettes suspended in acetone and applied to skin for 15 months [Ex. 4&hyph;327]. In lifetime rat studies, intrapulmonary
implants of mainstream smoke condensate in a lipid vehicle caused a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of lung
carcinomas [Exs. 4&hyph;75, 4&hyph;289].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The polyamines contained in tobacco smoke, spermidine, spermine, and their diamine precursor, putrescine, are
believed to have an essential role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Formation of putrescine from
ornithine is catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis.
A significant increase in lung and trachea ornithine decarboxylase activity was observed by Olsen [Ex. 4&hyph;245]
after an eight week exposure of male Sprague-Dawley rats to MS smoke. All dilutions of SS smoke exposure caused significant
increase in trachea ODC activity but did not influence the lung ODC activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental tobacco smoke induced carcinogenicity is also supported by a case-control study of lung cancer in
pet dogs [Ex. 4&hyph;259]. The study compared the incidence of lung cancer in pet dogs exposed to their owners' smoking
versus dogs whose owners did not smoke. Dogs have a very low natural incidence of lung cancer. There was an elevated
risk of lung cancer (Relative Risk = 1.6) observed in pets with smoking owners. However, the analysis was statistically
insignificant, perhaps in part due to small sample size.

Short-term mutagenicity tests have gained widespread acceptance as an initial step in the identification of potential
carcinogens. Extensive use of these tests has come about because they are easy to perform and are inexpensive and also
because of the reported high positive correlations between short-term mutagenicity tests and carcinogenicity.
It has been reported that 90 percent of the carcinogens tested are mutagens and 90 percent of the noncarcinogens are
nonmutagens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several short-term bioassays have been performed to evaluate the genotoxicity of cigarette smoke. While most of
them have evaluated the effect of cigarette smoke condensate, some have attempted to evaluate either the gas phase
or the whole smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most commonly employed assay for mutagenic activity employs various strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Whole smoke as well as cigarette smoke condensate of tobacco have been shown to be mutagenic in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 strain TA 1538 [Ex. 4&hyph;21]. Sidestream smoke was also found to be mutagenic in a system where the smoke was tested
directly on the bacterial plates [Ex. 4&hyph;246]. Sidestream smoke and extracts of ETS collected from indoor air
[Exs. 4&hyph;202, 4&hyph;5, 4&hyph;198, 4&hyph;201, 4&hyph;203] also exhibited mutagenic activity in this bacterial
strain. Claxton et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;55] found that sidestream smoke accounted for approximately 60% of the total 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mutagenicity per cigarette, 40% from the sidestream smoke particulates and 20% from the semi-volatiles. The highly
volatile fraction, from either mainstream or sidestream smoke was not mutagenic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Condensates from both mainstream [Exs. 4&hyph;89, 4&hyph;193] and sidestream smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;90] have also been
reported to have mutagenic activity. Doolittle et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;89] demonstrated the genotoxicity of the sidestream
smoke from the Kentucky Reference cigarette (1R4F) by employing several different assays. In their study, sidestream
smoke produced positive results in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
strains TA98, TA100, TA1537, and TA1538 in the presence of S9 mix from aroclor-induced rat liver but produced negative
results in strain TA1535. They also showed that sidestream smoke produced positive results in the Chinese hamster
ovary cells chromosomal aberration assay and in the Chinese hamster ovary cell sister-chromatid exchange assay
both with and without metabolic activation. They demonstrated that the sidestream smoke was weakly positive in inducing
DNA repair in cultured rat hepatocytes. However, sidestream smoke was nonmutagenic in the Chinese hamster ovary
cell-HGPRT assay both with and without metabolic activation but it was found to be cytotoxic in this system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their further studies, Doolittle et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;90] observed similar responses when they measured the genotoxic
activity of mainstream cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) from Kentucky reference research cigarette (1R4F). As
seen with sidestream smoke, CSC in this study was mutagenic in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
strain TA98, TA100, TA1537, and TA1538 in the presence of S9 mix but was negative in strain TA1535. CSC was also positive
in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells-chromosomal aberration assay and in the CHO-sister-chromatid exchange
assay both with and without metabolic activation. CSC was weakly positive in inducing DNA repair in cultured rat hepatocytes.
However, again as seen with sidestream smoke, CSC was nonmutagenic in the CHO&hyph;HGPRT assay, with or without metabolic
activation but was found to be cytotoxic in this system. The results from these two studies appear to indicate that
sidestream smoke behaves very much like mainstream smoke in these assays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mohtashamipur et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;227] demonstrated significant mutagenic activity in the urine of rats exposed
to sidestream smoke. In this study, cigarettes were machine smoked under standardized laboratory conditions and
the sidestream smoke of two cigarettes was directed through metabolism cages containing rats. The urine of these
rats was collected 24 hours prior to the SS exposure and 24 hours after the onset of the exposure. The individual urine
samples of all (10) rats after exposure showed significantly higher activity for direct-acting mutagens (in strain
TA1538) than the urine samples of the same rats before the exposure.

The formation of DNA adducts is widely accepted as an initial step in the carcinogenesis process. The measurement
of DNA adducts by the 32P-postlabeling assay has been used as a way to assess DNA damage following exposure to cigarette
smoke. Lee et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;194] exposed Sprague-Dawley rats to 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg total particulate matter/m3 of
aged and diluted sidestream smoke (ADSS) for 6 hours per day for 14 consecutive days. They examined the DNA from lung,
heart, larynx and liver after 7 and 14 days of exposure and after 14 days of recovery. They also examined alveolar macrophages
for chromosomal aberrations. Exposure related DNA adducts were found in the highest dose test. However, no elevation
in chromosomal aberrations was observed in alveolar macrophages in this study. Similar results were also obtained
when animals were exposed to the same three concentrations for up to 90 days. DNA adducts were seen in lung, heart and
larynx DNA of the animals exposed to the highest concentration of ADSS [Ex. 4&hyph;195]. The adduct levels were highest
after 90 days of exposure and were significantly reduced in all target tissues 90 days after cessation of exposure.
Again, chromosomal aberrations in alveolar macrophages were not elevated in any group after 90 days of exposure.
The authors concluded that the concentration of DNA adducts formed in the lung tissue did not increase linearly as
the ADSS concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mg.

assay that measures the number of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced has been employed widely to determine
the mutagenic activity of cigarette smoke. Valadand-Berrieu and Izard [Ex. 4&hyph;313] used a solution of the gas
phase from cigarette mainstream smoke and showed that this solution induced a significant dose-related increase
in sister-chromatid exchanges. Putman et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;257] have also demonstrated dose-dependent increases
in sister chromatid exchange frequencies in bone-marrow cells of mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 weeks.

Review of the literature clearly demonstrates that MS smoke and ETS exposure causes cancer in humans. These results
are supported not only by animal studies but also by studies that show SS smoke to be both genotoxic and clastogenic.

The epidemiological and clinical studies, taken in aggregate, indicate that exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke may produce mucous membrane irritation, pulmonary, cardiovascular, reproductive, and carcinogenic effects
in nonsmokers. Exposure to ETS may aggravate existing pulmonary or cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers. In addition,
animal studies show that both mainstream and sidestream tobacco smoke produce similar adverse effects.

1. Sick Building Syndrome and Building-Related Illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many case reports of material impairment of health due to occupational exposure to poor IAQ have been reported to OSHA
through submission to the indoor air quality docket [H&hyph;122]. These adverse health effects range from irritation
effects to more severe, life-threatening building-related illnesses, such as Legionnaire's disease, and cancer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford Motor Company responded in docket comment 3&hyph;447, that ``[p]resently, at Ford, we investigate an average
of two IAQ complaints per month which are predominantly classified as Sick Building Syndrome. We have seen Building-Related
Illness, but these incidents have been rare and associated with specific contaminant episodes. The IAQ complaints
we generally investigate are characterized by general malaise, headache, and flu-like symptoms that are said to
disappear when the occupants leave the building&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;Of the IAQ problems investigated,
about 20 percent can be attributed to PTS [passive tobacco smoke]/ETS. Upper respiratory irritation or eye irritation
typically are associated with these complaints.'' Similar types of health effects were reported to the agency in
docket comments 3&hyph;1, 3&hyph;22, 3&hyph;58, 3&hyph;142C, 3&hyph;367, 3&hyph;413, 3&hyph;529, 3&hyph;632,
3&hyph;634, 3&hyph;642, 3&hyph;659, and 3&hyph;698. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment [Ex. 3&hyph;433 reported that ``based upon approximately 30 IAQ investigations in a member company over
the past two and one-half years, the following adverse health effects have been reported in office environments:
eye, nose, and throat irritations; headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue; cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness.
These so-called ``sick building syndrome (SBS)'' symptoms often disappear when the person leaves the building environment.
These symptoms are usually subjective and non-specific, lacking a physician's diagnosis of a definite illness.''
Others have reported [Ex. 3&hyph;377] that ``as air flow and ventilation are cut back, our workers are becoming sick.
Many are exposed to contaminants or other harmful substances; and, without ventilation, these sources linger and
cause nausea, skin irritations and other unhealthy symptoms of illness. In severe cases, these contaminants and
bacteria have been known to contribute to upper respiratory infections.'' Comment 3&hyph;570 reported similar
health effects due to poor indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More serious health conditions have been reported ranging from severe asthma to central nervous systems disorders.
For example, Comment 3&hyph;158 responded that ``I have developed a serious asthma condition due to indoor air quality
problems. Besides, three of the remaining five employees at the branch office have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue
syndrome. In conversations with various health care professionals, I have come to the conclusion that the diagnoses
of chronic fatigue syndrome were actually sick building syndrome. Of the six employees at the branch office, four
of the six are moderate to heavy smokers. This does not take into consideration the other factors that could be causing
poor indoor air quality problems in the office.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 3&hyph;631 was a collection of reports from the workers in one building that illustrate the poor conditions
of a building that can lead to serious health effects in workers. Health problems experienced by workers in this building
included chronic sinus infections; headaches; fatigue; eye, nose and throat irritations; difficulty breathing
and congestion; allergies; and asthma. These health problems seem to clear up when the workers were out of the building
over a weekend or a vacation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The physical condition of this building was obviously in disrepair since the commenters reported pails of stagnant
water, collected from leaks in the roof, were left in hallways. Water in ``[t]hese pails ha[d] overflowed and run down
the stairs. What [wa]s left in the pails evaporate[d] leaving a gross residue of who knows what.'' The water leaks from
the roof caused mold infestation and water damage. Water logged insulation hung in the ceiling out in a hallway. There
was an obvious lack of routine, sufficient cleaning. Dust and particulate matter were visible in the air. The bathrooms
were dirty. Smells of sewer gas, mold, and diesel and other vehicular fumes permeated the office space. Ventilation
problems were evident since paint or varnish fumes lingered whenever part of the inside physical structure of the
building was painted. Tar fumes were evident from constant patching of the leaky roof. Insect infestation of the building
was evident. Pesticide fumes lingered whenever the building was spray[ed] for roaches and steam bugs. Workers sighted
cockroaches, silverfish, and steam bugs near the coffee shop and on back stairs. The comment continued that ``a sink
faucet in the lunch room has been leaking for years and water runs on the counter under the toaster and microwave. The
water heater had leaked for about 2 months before it was fixed. At that time the carpet was soaked and water was running
under the wall into a supervisor's office. There is a moldy odor from this carpet and the floor below.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cancer has also been reported to be associated with poor indoor air quality. A courthouse in San Diego, California
[Ex. 3&hyph;55], ``is notorious for poor air quality and employee respiratory illness and cancer.'' It was reported
to OSHA that many long-term employees have cancer (stomach and lung cancer), terminal lung disease, chronic ear and
throat infections, and bronchial problems'' [Exs. 3&hyph;585, 3&hyph;635, 3&hyph;637, 3&hyph;68]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 3&hyph;630 from a union reported that ``[a]fter surveying thousands of workers across the country, SEIU
compiled actual survey responses that list adverse health effects caused by indoor air pollution. These include
headaches, nose congestion or irritation, throat irritation, dry cough, dry or itchy skin, dizziness, nausea, lethargy
or fatigue, colds, asthma/wheezing, chest tightness, runny nose/post nasal drip, eye or contact lens irritation,
respiratory difficulties. In addition, EPA estimates that pollutants found in indoor air are responsible for 2,500
to 6,500 cancer deaths each year'' [refer to Ex. 3&hyph;630L].

These concerns are not just relevant to office workers but also to maintenance and other nonindustrial workers that
work in indoor environments. For example, comment 3&hyph;347 responded that ``[i]n our closed, indoor work environments,
air quality is a very real health and safety concern to professional painters. I have seen firsthand otherwise healthy
men and women pass out or get violently ill as a result of being exposed to indoor air contaminants.'' Comment 3&hyph;412
responded ``[o]ur locals have encountered air-pollution problems ranging from ink mist and photocopier emissions
to asbestos and microbial disease. The level of toxic chemical contaminants is often alarmingly high in our darkrooms,
and carbon-monoxide emissions from trucks at newspaper loading docks frequently penetrate the ventilation system.
In 1985 microbial contamination from a water tower infected six New York Times employees with Legionnaires' Disease
and 34 others with less serious respiratory infections.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation engineers are also affected by poor indoor air quality. Comment 3&hyph;452 responded that ``[t]his is
particularly important for the operation engineers who appear healthy and then suffer from respiratory problems,
much like allergic reactions, after working in a building with poor ventilation.''

2. Environmental Tobacco Smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many case reports of severe material impairment of health due to occupational exposure to ETS have been reported to
OSHA through submission to the indoor air quality docket [H&hyph;122]. Information contained in these comments
indicate that adverse health effects in workers due to environmental tobacco smoke exposure while at work range from
mucous membrane irritation (eye, nose, and throat effects) to more severe, life-threatening conditions, such as
status asthma, other chronic lung diseases and heart diseases. For example, comment 3&hyph;309 responded [Regarding
ETS exposure in a cafeteria], ``By the time I have finished lunch my eyes are tearing, my nose is plugged, and I have a
headache'' as well as comment 3&hyph;315, ``I had fewer headaches and fewer respiratory ailments; my chronic sore
throat disappeared [after a company-wide no smoking policy was implemented]''. Comment 3&hyph;22 responded ``[m]y
patients find it hard to obtain smoke free workplaces. I have seen patients who have suffered status asthma from workplace
smoking, patients who have had to quit their jobs because of ETS in the workplace. Recently, one of my never smoking
patients sustained vocal cord lesions seen almost entirely in smokers.'' Comment 3&hyph;104 continued that ``[p]assive
tobacco smoke (PTS) is the principal indoor air contaminant in my office building in Rockefeller Center. While smoking
is limited to `private offices', the smoke flows freely from these private offices throughout the entire general
office areas since the smokers will not keep their doors closed, and even when they do, they have to come out sometime.
And, as soon as the door is opened, the dense smoke accumulation within the office is diffused to all adjacent work areas.
Because office buildings have closed ventilation systems, only a `smoke free' office policy can be effective. Half
measures only cause further stress, frustration and irritation to both smokers and nonsmokers.'' Comment 3&hyph;289
responded that ``I have been exposed to asbestos culminating in my getting asbestosis (plural plaque) of the lungs.
The combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of asbestos exposure plus second-hand smoke from my smoking co-workers has posed and is currently posing a health
risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
me.''

III. Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contaminants which contribute to poor indoor air quality can be attributed to both outside air and inside air. Outside
air contaminants can be introduced into a building through the ventilation intakes, doors, building envelope, and
windows. Outside air contaminants include vehicular exhausts, industrial emissions, microbiologicals, and pollen.
Inside air contaminants are emitted from building materials and furnishings, appliances, office equipment and
supplies, biological organisms, and of course, pollutants introduced by the building occupants themselves. Inside
air contaminants include tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, combustion gases such as carbon monoxide,
and occupant-generated bioeffluents. The concentration of these contaminants in buildings can increase if ventilation
systems are inadequately designed, maintained and operated or if strong local contaminant sources are not controlled.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Sources of Indoor Air Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A wide variety of substances are emitted by building construction materials and interior furnishings, appliances,
office equipment, and supplies, human activities, and biological agents. For example, formaldehyde is emitted
from various wood products, including particle board, plywood, pressed-wood, paneling, some carpeting and backing,
some furniture and dyed materials, urea-formaldehyde insulating foam, some cleaners and deodorizers, and from
press textiles. Volatile organic compounds, including alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, aldehydes,
and ketones are emitted from solvents and cleaning compounds, paints, glues, caulks, and resins, spray propellants,
fabric softeners and deodorizers, unvented combustion sources, dry-cleaning fluids, arts and crafts, some fabrics
and furnishings, stored gasoline, cooking, building and roofing materials, waxes and polishing compounds, pens
and markers, binders and plasticizers. Pesticides also contain a variety of toxic organic compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building materials are point sources of emissions that include a variety of VOCs (Table III&hyph;1). Some of these
materials have been linked to indoor air quality problems. The probability of a source emitting contaminants is related
to the age of the material. The newer the material, the higher the potential for emitting contaminants. These materials
include adhesives, carpeting, caulks, glazing compounds, and paints [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. These materials, as well
as furnishings can act as a sponge or sink in which VOCs are absorbed and then re-emitted later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliances, office equipment, and supplies can emit VOCs and also particulates [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Table III&hyph;2
lists the many contaminants that can be emitted from these point sources. There is an indirect relationship between
the age of the point source and the potential rate of contaminant emission [Ex. 4&hyph;33].

Emissions from equipment, such as computers, will decrease over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time compared to emissions from equipment that continually use chemicals. Emissions from such equipment (e.g.,
laser printers) that use chemicals continually, will obtain a steady state concentration dependent upon the chemicals
used and frequency of equipment use.

B. Microbial Contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Three conditions must exist in buildings before microbial contamination can occur: high humidity (over 60%), appropriate
temperatures (varies according to microbe), and appropriate growth media [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;33]. These conditions
are found in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC systems provide multiple sites for
microbes to grow (reservoir) and also the means to disperse the microbes throughout the ventilated space. These reservoirs
of microbial growth, if allowed to proliferate unchecked, can lead to indoor air quality problems once the microbes
or microbe-related products, such as endotoxins, are dispersed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building materials that have been soaked with water, such as fiberglass insulation in air handlers, furnishings
and fabrics, ceiling tiles, and carpeting are excellent media for microbial growth. Biological organisms, including
fungal spores, bacteria, viruses, pollens, and protozoa derived from mold growth have been identified in humidifiers
with stagnant water, water damaged surfaces and materials, condensing coils and drip-pans in HVAC systems, drainage
pans in refrigerators, dirty heating coils, and are also associated with mammals, arthopods and insects. Table III&hyph;3
gives examples of biologicals found in indoor environments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various allergens have been associated with the development of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or airway hyperresponsiveness
(Table III&hyph;3) [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Many of these allergens are common to the nonindustrial work environment. These
include chemical volatiles and dusts, arthropods, and dusts, particulates &amp; fibers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exposures that cause hypersensitivity reactions include microorganisms, fumes, vapors, and dusts (Table III&hyph;5).
These exposures are associated with the development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis or a less serious variant,
humidifier fever [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Many of these contaminants are found in the nonindustrial workplace. Birds and
rodents are common pests. Air intakes can be contaminated with bird droppings and other avian-associated problems
when used as nesting sites. These problems can affect the quality of the air being brought into the ventilation system
through these air intakes. Rodent infestations affect work areas directly. Many of the chemicals listed in Table
III&hyph;5 are commonly found in most workplaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, exposure to contaminants in nonindustrial workplaces will vary according to the characteristics of
the building. These include its age, types of materials used in construction and the type of equipment and supplies
that are used by building occupants. The design, maintenance, and operation of the building's HVAC system as well
as the general housekeeping of the building, can greatly influence the levels of contaminants that exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests data on the levels of these contaminants in nonindustrial workplaces.

C. Exposure Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Low-level Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure of susceptible people to low level mixtures of VOCs have induced
mucous membrane irritation and pulmonary effects. Some of these studies are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential of indoor air contamination to produce adverse effects in humans was demonstrated by Molhave et al.
in Denmark [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. These researchers studied 62 subjects suffering from ``indoor climate symptoms''.
These subjects reported primarily eye and upper respiratory tract irritation, but were otherwise healthy individuals
that did not suffer from asthma, allergy, or bronchitis. The subjects were exposed to a mixture of VOCs in concentrations
of 0, 5, or 25 mg/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These concentrations respectively represented ``clean'' air, average polluted air, and the maximum polluted
air in Danish households. After exposure, a Digit Span test was administered. The study found significant declines
in performance on this test; demonstrating that low-level exposures to volatile organic compounds had an adverse
effect on the ability to concentrate [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Otto et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;248], repeating the Molhave et al. (1984) experiment, studied 66 healthy subjects with no
history of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation. These subjects were exposed at 0 and 25 mg/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 VOC-contaminated air. Otto et al. reported that while subjects found the odor of chemicals unpleasant, to degrade
indoor air quality, to increase headache, and produce general discomfort, VOC exposure for 2.75 hours duration did
not affect performance on any behavioral tests. These results imply that persons who experience symptoms of SBS may
have a lower threshold for certain health effects compared to nonreactive people. This suggests that those with compromised
immune response (e.g. allergy sufferers) may be at elevated risk of SBS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ahlstrom, et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;2] found that synergistic effects may occur when one strong indoor irritant interacts
with other indoor contaminants present at low-level concentrations. Ahlstrom et al. found that there was almost
a 4-fold increase in the perceived odor strength of formaldehyde at low concentration (0.08 ppm) when mixed with 100%
indoor air from a building where SBS was reported, relative to 10% indoor air from the same building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Report of the Canadian Interministerial Committee on Indoor Air Quality [Ex. 4&hyph;264] adopts the World Health
Organization's definition of health: ``Health refers to a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being,
and not just the absence of disease or infirmity.'' This definition was adopted to allow the setting of indoor air quality
guidelines based on ``comfort'' as well as ``health''. The report observes that the symptoms of SBS are sufficiently
general or subjective that they may be indicative of several other medical conditions. Therefore, perhaps the best
indicator that workplace exposure may play a role in the symptoms reported by an individual is the observation that
symptoms worsen during the work day, and disappear shortly after leaving work. They state that because there is a wide
variation in individual susceptibility, based on genetics, age, medication, previous exposure to pollutants,
gender, and state of health, especially those with allergies, that certain individuals may be more sensitive to SBS
than others.

2. Bioaerosols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The levels of bioaerosols in the indoor environment should reflect those found in the outdoor environment. A rank
order assessment, comparing the abundance of microorganisms in the outdoor versus indoor environment is one way
of assessing this relationship [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;229]. If indoor and outdoor sampling results are not comparable,
then it is possible that a reservoir of a particular microbe may be amplifying in the indoor environment; especially
if moisture and a nutrient-rich substrate are available [Ex. 4&hyph;229]. An example of this would be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commonly found in the outdoor environment, the bacteria are as expected, commonly found in untreated potable and
nonpotable water. Situations can occur that allow these reservoirs to amplify not only in potable water and hot water
service systems but also water used in cooling towers and evaporative condensers [Ex. 4&hyph;229]. Infection occurs
if the bacteria are disseminated, either through the HVAC system or potable water system (e.g., showers) to the breathing
zone of a susceptible person. A healthy individual may develop the less severe Pontiac Fever. An individual that smokes
or is older may develop the more serious pneumonia [Exs. 4&hyph;33, 4&hyph;229].

3. Environmental Tobacco Smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The burning of tobacco in enclosed workplaces releases an aerosol containing a large variety of solid, liquid, and
gas phase chemical compounds. Generation of tobacco smoke is governed by the source emission characteristics of
smokers and their tobacco products, whereas removal is primarily determined by the rate of replacement of building
air by outside air, with re-emission of surface-sorbed compounds playing a minor role. Natural and mechanical ventilation
systems are designed primarily to limit the accumulation of the products of human respiratory metabolism, and secondarily
to limit odor; not to control the byproducts of biomass combustion. Thus, smoking indoors creates air pollution which
is not adequately abated by customary ventilation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to tobacco smoke primarily occurs through the inhalation route. Such an exposure can be measured by the determination
of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of tobacco smoke constituents and/or their metabolites.
However, relatively few of these individual constituents have been identified and characterized. Also, measurement
of all components in tobacco smoke is not feasible. Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify a marker which, when
measured, will accurately represent the frequency, duration and magnitude of the exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This discussion reviews available data for the purposes of assessing exposure to ETS in the workplace. Nonsmokers
are exposed to mainstream smoke after it has been exhaled by smokers, and to diluted sidestream smoke. Issues covered
include activity patterns affecting the duration of nonsmokers' exposures, the concentrations of ETS in buildings,
the comparison of ETS components in indoor workplaces, levels of biomarkers in workers, and the inadequacy of general
dilution ventilation to address ETS exposure control. This discussion will indicate not only that exposure occurs,
but that nonsmokers absorb ETS components.

(a) Chemistry.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pipe, cigar, and cigarette smoke all contribute to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) but cigarette smoke is of principal
interest because it is by far the most common. Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7 list some of the known constituents
of tobacco smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combustion of tobacco leads to the formation of mainstream smoke (MS) and sidestream smoke (SS). MS is generated
during puff-drawing in the burning cone and hot zones; it travels through the tobacco column and is inhaled by the smoker.
The smoke which is exhaled by the smoker, while different from the inhaled smoke, is also considered ``mainstream.''
SS is formed in between puff-drawing and is emitted directly from the smoldering tobacco product into the ambient
air.

MS and SS cigarette smoke are chemically and physically complex mixtures consisting of electrically charged submicron
liquid particles at very high concentration consisting of permanent gases, reactive gases, and a large variety of
organic chemicals. The composition of the smoke and especially the total quantities of individual constituents
delivered are dependent on the conditions of smoke generation [Ex. 4&hyph;311].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nicotine, while found in the particulate phase in MS, is found predominantly in the gas phase in ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;100].
The differences in size distribution for MS and SS particles, as well as the different breathing patterns of smokers
and nonsmokers, affect deposition of the produced particle contaminants in various regions of the respiratory tract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are substantial similarities and some differences between MS and SS emissions from cigarettes [Exs. 3&hyph;689D,
4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;239]. Differences in MS and SS emissions are due to differences in the temperature of the combustion
of tobacco, pH, and degree of dilution with the air, which is accompanied by a correspondingly rapid decrease in temperature.
SS is generated at a lower temperature (approximately 600
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C between puffs versus 800 to 900
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for MS during puffs) and at a higher pH (6.7&hyph;7.5 versus 6.0&hyph;6.7) than MS. Being slightly more alkaline,
SS contains more ammonia, is depleted of acids, contains greater quantities of organic bases, and contains less hydrogen
cyanide than MS. Differences in MS and SS are also ascribable to differences in the oxygen concentration (16% in MS
versus 2% in SS). SS contaminants are generated in a more reducing environment than those in MS, which will affect the
distribution of some compounds. Nitrosamines, for example, are present in greater concentrations in SS than in MS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the compounds found in MS, which were identified as human carcinogens, are also found in SS emissions [Exs.
3&hyph;689D, 4&hyph;93, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;269] and at emission rates considerably higher than for
MS. SS contains ten times more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aza-arenes and amines as compared with MS [Ex. 4&hyph;126].
All of the five known carcinogens, nine probable human carcinogens, and three animal carcinogens are emitted at higher
levels in SS than in MS, several by an order of magnitude or more. Several toxic compounds found in MS are also found in
SS (carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, nicotine, acrolein, acetone, etc.), in some cases by an order of magnitude
or higher (Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SS emissions, quantitatively, show little variability as a function of a number of variables (puff volume, filter
versus nonfilter cigarette, and filter ventilation [Exs. 4&hyph;1, 4&hyph;34, 4&hyph;54, 4&hyph;128, 4&hyph;129,
4&hyph;141]. The lack of substantial variability in SS emissions is related to the fact that they are primarily related
to the weight of tobacco and paper consumed during the smoldering period, with little influence exerted by cigarette
design [Ex. 4&hyph;129].

(b) Human Activity Pattern Studies Used to Assess Workplace Exposure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Human activity pattern studies utilize random samples of human activity patterns using questionnaires and time-diary
data to provide detailed generalizable data about human behavior. Such studies have been used to assess exposure
to ETS. In 1987&hyph;1988, the California Air Resources Board sponsored a probability-based cross-sectional sample
of 1,579 Californians aged 18 years and older, called the California Activity Pattern Survey (CAPS) [Exs. 4&hyph;168,
4&hyph;271]. The study was designed to provide information on time spent in various locations, including indoors,
outdoors, and in transit, as well as specific microenvironments, such as living rooms, kitchens, automobiles, or
buses. The study focused on time spent in activities such as cooking or playing sports, but more specifically targeted
activities and environments that had implications for air pollution exposure, such as the presence of smokers, use
of cooking equipment or solvents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In analyzing the data from CAPS, Jenkins et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;168] and Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] found that time
spent at work had a high correlation with exposure to ETS. This association of ETS exposure with work settings remained
strong after controlling for the length of the activity episode, and hence was not simply a function of longer time
intervals at work. Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] also found that men reported higher levels of exposure than women,
even after controlling for age, employment status, shorter working hours, etc. This finding suggests that the epidemiological
studies of passive smoking and lung cancer, which have focussed on women, may be underestimating the effect of ETS
on lung cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further analysis of the CAP study [Ex. 4&hyph;169] verifies the high percentage of nonsmokers who are exposed to ETS
while at work. This is indicated when the data are analyzed by employed nonsmoker status. As indicated in Table III&hyph;8,
51% of male and 38% of female nonsmokers reported ETS exposure at work. The average duration of this exposure was 313
minutes for males and 350 minutes for females. When the group that reported exposure at the workplace is analyzed further
it becomes apparent that the overwhelming exposure location for these employed nonsmokers is the workplace (Table
III&hyph;9). As indicated in Table III&hyph;9, 77% of males and 85% of females were exposed an average of 313 minutes
and 350 minutes, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One other finding is that the more time spent at work, the higher the likelihood of greater ETS exposure. For example,
the average duration of exposure to homemakers was approximately 2 hours a day, for workers the average duration of
exposure was approximately 3 hours a day.

Work breaks and meals at work were the work activities most closely associated with ETS exposure, 51% and 35% respectively
versus 27% for work per se [Ex. 4&hyph;271]. In other words, nonsmokers experienced ETS exposure in break areas more
than in general work areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When white collar versus blue collar workplaces were compared, 37% of factories/plants versus 22% of offices had
episodes of ETS exposure, suggesting that blue collar nonsmoking workers have a greater exposure to ETS than white
collar workers. For the CAP population, twice as many workers were employed in offices as were in factories [Ex. 4&hyph;271].
The most ETS exposed nonsmokers were those with 10 or more hours per day of work (especially at plants/factories),
more than 2 hours per day of restaurant time, and more than 1 hour per day of bar or nightclub time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] concluded that the probability of passive smoking is highest for a combination of
various social and work activities, consistent with the notion that activities that involve more people involve
a greater chance of contact with people who smoke. A limitation of the CAP survey is that the data do not provide information
on the intensity of exposure in the various microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;271].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the CAP study showed that the most powerful predictor of potential exposure to ETS was being employed.
Respondents who spent more than ten hours a day at the workplace were found to report more ETS exposure than those working
less than 10 hours a day or not at all. Further data from this study show that the workplace is the location with the highest
reported exposure to ETS in enclosed environments, and such exposure is on average nearly three times more prevalent
at work than at home.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another relevant data source for assessing ETS exposure in the workplace is the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In its Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
(NHIS-HPDP) supplement, CDC collected self-reported information on smoking from a representative sample of the
U.S. population [Ex. 4&hyph;51]. The results suggest that at least 19% of employed nonsmokers experience ETS exposure
at work. The CDC study results represent the prevalence of occupational exposure among nonsmoking adults [see section
IV for further discussion of this study].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a smaller study, Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67] studied the prevalence of exposure to ETS in 663 (44% male) never-
and exsmokers aged 18&hyph;84 years, who attended a cancer clinic in Buffalo, New York in 1986 (see Table IV&hyph;9).
The study employed questionnaires and analysis of urinary cotinine levels. The subjects were asked if they were exposed
to passive smoke either at home or at work in the four days preceding the interview. A further analysis of this data focusing
on workers from this survey determined that overall, 339 subjects were currently employed. Of these 264 (77%) reported
ETS exposure at work. The percentage of subjects exposed to ETS at both work and the home was 29% (n=99). The percentage
of subjects exposed at home, but not at work was 7% (n=23). The percentage of subjects exposed at work, but not at home
was 49% (n=165). The percentage of subjects exposed neither at home or work was 15% (n=52). This further analysis indicates
that the workplace is a significant source of ETS exposure for nonsmoking, employed people.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emmons et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;98] reported on a study of 186 nonsmoking volunteers from workplace settings selected to
have a wide range of exposure to ETS. The subjects were asked to keep a 7-day exposure diary. The worksites ranged from
those with minimal restrictions and high levels of exposure (long-term care and psychiatric facilities, chemical
dependency and treatment centers, and a VA Hospital) to those with extensive restrictions and low exposure (e.g.,
state health department and community hospitals). Seventy-six percent of the subjects reported being regularly
exposed to ETS in the workplace. The percentage of subjects reporting exposure at work is similar to that found by Cummings
et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67]. Nonsmokers encountered significantly more exposure to ETS at work (50%) as compared to home
(10%). When the data set was examined by the presence or absence of smokers in the home, however, subjects who lived
with smokers had virtually equivalent exposures across all three settings: work (34%), home (36%), and ``other''
(31%). Nonsmokers living with smokers received 29 minutes per day of exposure at work and 31 minutes per day at home
and 27 minutes per day in other settings. On the other hand, subjects who did not live with smokers had the majority of
their exposure at work (36 minutes per day) and very little at other settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional studies verify that the workplace is an important source of exposure to ETS, particularly for nonsmokers
unexposed at home [Exs. 4&hyph;172, 4&hyph;262, 4&hyph;315]. A U.K. study of exposure to ETS in 20 nonsmoking men
whose wives smoked showed that 78% of the men's reported hours of exposure came from outside the home; by contrast,
90% of the ETS exposure of 101 nonsmoking men whose wives did not smoke was reported to come from non-domestic microenvironments
[Ex. 4&hyph;315]. Repace and Lowrey [Ex. 4&hyph;262] estimated that 86% of the U.S. population was exposed to ETS,
and that the workplace was more important than the home as a source of ETS exposure, when weighted by the duration, exposure
intensity, and probability of exposure. Kabat and Wynder [Ex. 4&hyph;172], in a study of 215 sixty-year-old U.S.
women nonsmokers, found that 65% reported exposure to ETS at home and 67% reported exposure at work, averaged over
adulthood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusion that can be made from the activity surveys is that the workplace is a major location of ETS-exposure
to nonsmokers. Human activities that involve contact with a greater number of people increase the probability of
contact with smokers, and thus with ETS. These studies indicate that the workplace, with its high person densities
relative to other microenvironments, including the home, appears to be a major factor in the working nonsmoking population's
ETS exposure.

Personal monitoring studies have confirmed the role of the workplace as an important microenvironment of ETS exposure
to nonsmokers. Spengler et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;288] and Sexton et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;280] demonstrated by personal monitoring
of respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and the use of time-activity questionnaires that exposures to ETS both
at home and at work are significant contributors to personal RSP exposures. Coultas et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;66], in a pilot
study of 15 nonsmokers in Albuquerque, New Mexico, collected questionnaires and samples of saliva and urine to determine
workplace ETS exposure. Personal air samples were obtained pre- and post-workshift. Exposure to ETS was reported
by 13 of the 15 subjects. The mean number of hours of exposure was 3.4 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1). Basically, although the levels of cotinine, respirable particles, and nicotine varied with self-reports
of ETS exposure, the general trend was a direct relationship between increasing incidence of self-reporting of exposure
and actual biomarker data. Coghlin, Hammond, and Gann [Ex. 4&hyph;61] found similar results for 53 nonsmoking volunteers
studied by use of personal nicotine monitors, diaries, and questionnaires. They also found that the closer a nonsmoker
was to a smoker, the higher the probability that the nonsmoker would report exposure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presently, vapor phase nicotine and respirable suspended particulate matter (ETS&hyph;RSP) are the most commonly
used markers for ETS because of their ease of measurement, knowledge of their emission rate from tobacco combustion,
and their relationship to other ETS contaminants [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Controlled experiments have shown that vapor
phase nicotine varies with the source strength, and shows little variation among brands of cigarettes. Field studies
have also shown that vapor phase nicotine concentrations are correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked, and
further that weekly average nicotine concentrations are correlated with ETS-RSP [Ex. 4&hyph;311].

(d) Levels of Respirable Suspended Particulates and Nicotine Found in Field Studies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and nicotine are the most commonly used surrogates for ETS exposure [Ex.
4&hyph;239]. Both chamber and field studies have demonstrated that tobacco combustion has a major impact on indoor
RSP mass when particle size is under 2.5 microns [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. A few examples illustrating the impact of ETS on
nicotine and RSP concentrations in workplace and domestic microenvironments are shown in Tables III&hyph;10 and
III&hyph;11. Studies of RSP in public access buildings by Leaderer et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;190], First [Ex. 4&hyph;105],
and Repace and Lowrey [Exs. 4&hyph;260, 4&hyph;261] (a total of 42 smoking buildings and 21 nonsmoking buildings)
showed that the weighted average RSP level during smoking in the smoking buildings was 262 &mu;g/m3, while in the nonsmoking
buildings the RSP level average 36 &mu;g/m3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leaderer and Hammond [Ex. 4&hyph;189] measured weekly average vapor phase nicotine and RSP concentrations in 96
residences. Vapor phase nicotine measurements were found to be closely related to number of cigarettes smoked and
highly predictive of RSP generated by tobacco combustion. The mean RSP background in the absence of measurable nicotine
was found to be 15.2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7 &mu;g/m3. The mean RSP value in the presence of nicotine was 44.1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30 &mu;g/m3. The weekly mean nicotine concentration in the 47 residences with detectable nicotine values was 2.17
&mu;g/m3 (Table III&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary statistics of additional studies on personal monitoring for nicotine are shown in Table III&hyph;11 [Ex.
4&hyph;263]. These studies show that the median exposures ranged from 5 to 20 &mu;g/m3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary nicotine data analyzed by the U.S. EPA [Ex. 4&hyph;311] suggest that average nicotine values in residences
where smoking is occurring will average 2 to approximately 10 &mu;g/m3, with peak values of 0.1 to 14 &mu;g/m3 as shown
in Table III&hyph;10. Offices with smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to
that of residences, but with considerably higher peak values. RSP mass concentrations in smoker-occupied residences
show average increases of from 18 to 95 &mu;g/m3, with individual increases as high as 560 &mu;g/m3 or as low as 5 &mu;g/m3.
ETS&hyph;RSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on average appear to be about the same as in residences.
Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of increases
in particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential or office environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, field data show that RSP is elevated by one to two orders of magnitude during smoking, and that nicotine
released during smoking is easily detectable in both homes and workplaces by area or personal monitors. Offices with
smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to that of residences (2 to 10 &mu;g/m3),
but with considerably higher maximum values. ETS&hyph;RSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on
average appear to be about the same as residences (18 to 95 &mu;g/m3). Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor
spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential
or office environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. It must be noted that measurements of nicotine and ETS&hyph;RSP in indoor
spaces do not constitute a direct measure of total exposure. Concentrations measured in all microenvironments have
to be combined with human activity pattern studies to determine the time-weighted sum of various exposures.

(e) Biomarkers of Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nicotine, and its metabolite, cotinine, and other tobacco smoke constituents in the saliva, blood and urine have
been used as biomarkers of active and passive smoking. Nicotine and cotinine can be used to determine the integrated
short-term exposure of ETS across all microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;311].

Both nicotine and cotinine are tobacco-specific. Cotinine in saliva, blood, and urine is the most widely accepted
biomarker for integrated exposure to both active smoking and ETS by virtue of its longer half-life than nicotine in
body fluids. The half-life of cotinine in nonsmokers is of the order of a day, making it a good indicator of integrated
ETS exposure over the previous day or two [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Although intersubject variability exists for both nicotine
absorption and cotinine metabolism [Exs. 4&hyph;156, 4&hyph;162], cotinine is a good indicator that ETS exposure
has taken place [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Further, studies show that cotinine levels correlate with levels of recent ETS
exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, nonsmokers' exposure to ETS has been characterized by a database of widely used atmospheric and biological
markers which have been measured in a number of workplaces, such as offices, restaurants, commercial buildings,
and on trains and in planes. OSHA believes that this database is sufficient to support the risk assessment which follows.
ETS-nicotine exposures of the average worker appear to be of the order of 5 to 10 micrograms per cubic meter (&mu;g/m3),
and for the most-exposed workers, 50 to 100 &mu;g/m3). For ETS-RSP, exposures are about tenfold that of the nicotine
levels. The concentrations of various ETS atmospheric markers to which nonsmokers are exposed in the workplace,
such as nicotine, respirable suspended particulate matter (RSP) and carbon monoxide, are linearly correlated with
the amount of tobacco burned. Studies of human activity patterns show that the workplace is the largest single contributor
to ETS exposure. Air exchange rates in nonindustrial workplaces are not designed to control the risks of ETS exposure.

(f) Inadequacy of General Dilution Ventilation to Address Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure Control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A primary function of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is to circulate air throughout
a building to achieve thermal and sensory comfort for the building occupants. The general ventilation function of
the HVAC system is to dilute and remove occupant generated bioeffluents and other contaminants from the space. However,
from the industrial hygiene perspective, general ventilation as delivered by a HVAC system, is not an acceptable
engineering control measure for controlling occupational exposures to ETS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dilution ventilation offers no protection in those cases where, due to the close proximity to a smoker (e.g., contaminant
point source), the nonsmoking employee may be exposed to large amounts of sidestream smoke and exhaled mainstream
smoke (ETS). Due to the limitations of general ventilation, the smoke cannot be removed from the air before reaching
the breathing zone of nearby employees. The carcinogenicity of ETS discounts the use of general ventilation as an
engineering control for this contaminant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major ventilation guidance document available to HVAC practioners (e.g., designers, maintenance, and operators),
is Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'' [Ex. 4&hyph;333]. The standard
is published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) and
it specifies recommended minimum design outside air ventilation rates for 91 different applications. Based on this
current ventilation standard, a typical commercial HVAC system serving general office space should prescriptively
deliver 20 cubic feet per minute per person (cfm/person) of outside air to the occupied space to dilute occupant generated
contaminants like carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and body odors. This ventilation rate would provide what ASHRAE defines as ``acceptable indoor air quality'' (e.g.,
sensory comfort) to satisfy at least 80% of the building occupants. The prescribed ventilation rates in ASHRAE Standard
62&hyph;1989 are proportional to the occupants in the space (e.g., cfm/PER PERSON) because of the presumption that
the contamination produced is in proportion to the occupant density. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foreword of ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 states ``with respect to tobacco smoke and other contaminants, this
standard does not, and cannot, ensure the avoidance of all possible adverse health effects, but it reflects recognized
consensus criteria and guidance.'' As published, ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 did not include any summary and/or
explanation documentation which would explain the basis of the consensus standard. Without this documentation,
it can only be inferred that the standard was mostly based on satisfaction of sensory comfort rather than based on the
control of contaminants like ETS which may contribute to adverse health effects like lung cancer and heart disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method of room air distribution found in most HVAC systems is a mixing system that attempts to create an environment
of uniform air velocities, temperatures and humidities in the occupied zone of a room (e.g.; floor to 6 feet above floor).
In this occupied zone, air velocities less than 50 feet per minute (fpm) and minimization of temperature gradients
will promote occupant comfort. In a conventional mixing system where the supply air diffusers (outlets) and the return
air grilles are both located in the ceiling, the air motion in the occupied zone could be characterized as ``gentle
drift'' toward the ceiling where the room air is then mixed with the conditioned air being delivered to the room through
the supply air diffusers [1993 ASHRAE Handbook, Ch.31]. Because of natural convection currents and thermal buoyancy
forces it is common, especially during heating season, to have stagnant zones. In a mixing room air distribution system,
the emphasis is on comfort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other room air distribution schemes which consider contaminant control and have been used in the industrial
environment like displacement ventilation and unidirectional (plug-flow) airflow ventilation. In these schemes,
there is an attempt to move contaminants directionally along a clean to less clean gradient. These schemes are seldom
used in conventional HVAC systems due to their cost, feasibility and compromise of comfort issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the industrial hygiene perspective, local exhaust ventilation, specific to each source, would be the preferred
and recommended method for controlling occupational exposures to contaminant point sources like ETS. Such specific
ventilation is effective because the contaminant is captured or contained at its source before it is dispersed into
the work environment where only ineffective general dilution ventilation is available to control exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A designated smoking area which is enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside, and maintained under negative pressure
is sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Such areas could be considered an application
of local exhaust ventilation because the contaminant is being exhausted from a confined source without dispersal
into the general workspace.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determining factor in the decision to perform a quantitative risk assessment is the availability of suitable
data for use in such an assessment. A wide spectrum of health effects have been associated with exposure to indoor air
pollutants and ETS. These effects range from acute irritant effects to cancer. In the case of ETS, OSHA has determined
that data are available to quantify two types of risk: lung cancer and heart disease. For this risk assessment, OSHA
defines ``heart disease'' to be coronary heart disease excluding strokes, as defined in the Framingham study [Ex.
4&hyph;108]. In the case of indoor air pollutants, the only data available to OSHA were on specific acute health effects,
such as severe headaches, excluding migraines, and other respiratory conditions, such as ``stuffy nose'', ``runny
nose'', etc. OSHA is aware that there are more serious conditions such as legionellosis and hypersensitivity diseases
associated with poor indoor air and suspected to be potential occupational hazards. However, the Agency currently
does not have adequate data to conduct a quantitative risk assessment addressing these risks in the workplace. OSHA
is continuing to develop appropriate methodology to address risk estimations for conditions related to poor indoor
air quality in the workplace and is requesting input on data sources relevant to these efforts.

There is uncertainty associated with the quantification of any kind of risk. In this risk assessment, OSHA has tried
to describe many of the sources of uncertainty and to address their implications for OSHA's estimates of risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this rulemaking and for deriving a quantitative estimate of occupational risk, OSHA has concentrated
on information and data concerning heart disease and lung cancer as potential effects associated with exposure to
ETS.

B. Review of Epidemiologic Studies and Published Risk Estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a first step in this risk assessment, OSHA critically reviewed epidemiologic studies associating exposure to
ETS or indoor air pollutants with adverse health effects. The purpose of such a critical evaluation was to determine
whether exposure to ETS is a causal factor in cancer and heart disease and whether exposure to indoor air pollutants
has caused a significant increase in acute irritant effects. The critical review also enables OSHA to select those
studies that have potential for use in a quantitative risk assessment. Tables IV&hyph;1 and IV&hyph;2 contain a summary
of OSHA's assessment of several epidemiologic studies of ETS exposed individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA evaluated studies on exposure to ETS to determine the importance and weight of each study in the overall hazard
identification process. Of those, it was determined that fourteen showed a statistically strong association between
exposure to ETS and lung cancer and four showed a significant association between ETS exposure and heart disease.
Studies that were determined to be ``positive'' by OSHA's review standards met standard epidemiologic and statistical
criteria to support causation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, on the basis of the studies reviewed, OSHA concludes that the relative risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers due
to chronic exposure to ETS ranges between 1.20 and 1.50 and the relative risk for heart disease due to ETS exposure ranges
between 1.24 and 3.00.

Most published risk assessments are based on spousal exposure to ETS. These studies have examined the lung cancer
risk in nonsmoking housewives, using spousal smoking as a surrogate for the wife's exposure to ETS. The size of the
association between these health effects and ETS exposure in the workplace is expected to be at least as large as the
association seen between these health effects and ETS exposure in residential settings or public places. As noted
by Meridian Research in their 1988 report, ``.&blank;.&blank;. it is the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,
and not the environment in which that exposure occurs, that is the important risk factor'' [Ex. 4&hyph;221]. Therefore,
health effects observed and the risk estimates calculated from studies of the general population, or of selected
subgroups, such as nonsmoking wives of smoking husbands, are relevant to the working nonsmoking population.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In developing risk estimates for disease attributable to occupational exposure, reliance is placed on exposure
encountered in the workplace to the extent possible. However, in the absence of purely occupational data, information
derived in environments other than work sites is also considered. OSHA believes that there is no physiological difference
related to exposure (or its outcome) regardless of where it is experienced. This is true regardless of whether the
endpoint is lung cancer, heart disease, or indoor air related acute irritant effects. The only difference is that
the degree of exposure may be greater in one place than in the other. Available information which uses nicotine concentration
as an index of exposure suggests that the differences in exposure between office workplaces and residences lie well
within the uncertainties of the determinations and for some workplaces, such as restaurants and transportation
facilities, exposures are significantly higher than the average exposures found in residences. Thus, risk estimates
based on residential exposures are expected to accurately reflect occupational risks in most workplaces and possibly
underestimate the risk in some workplaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing its risk assessment for lung cancer, the EPA reviewed 19 studies which investigated nicotine concentrations
in various environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. EPA's analysis showed that the range of average nicotine concentrations
in office workplaces is very similar to that of homes. However, in some workplaces, such as restaurants and transportation
facilities, exposures are significantly higher. It is true that there are many complicating factors in such determinations
which could affect any final conclusions. For example, it is important to consider the duration of exposure, the intensity
of exposure, the distance from the sources and other factors as well. However, EPA's analysis suggests that risk assessments
based on home exposures are relevant to workplaces as well and, in comparison to some workplaces, may even result in
an underestimate of the true occupational risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, other studies substantiate the magnitude of workplace exposures. For example, Emmons et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;98]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that the majority of ETS exposure occurred in the workplace. Study subjects were selected from workplace settings
with a wide range of ETS exposure. The work sites ranged from those with minimal restriction of smoking and high levels
of exposure to work sites with extensive smoking restrictions and low exposure. Ninety percent of the subjects worked
outside the home. Eighty-four percent of those who worked outside the home (75.6% of the total sample) reported being
regularly exposed to smoking in the workplace. While the most highly exposed individuals in the study were those who
had both home and work exposures, it is clear that workplace exposure constituted a significant component of overall
exposure. Subjects who did not live with smokers reported that the majority of their exposure was in the workplace
(mean=36.1 min/day), home (mean=1.4 min/day) or in other locations (mean=13.1 min/day). Subjects who lived with
smokers reported receiving slightly more exposure at home than the workplace, however the difference between home
exposure and workplace exposure was not substantial (work: mean=29.4 min/day, home: mean=31.2 min/day, other:
mean=27.1 min/day). These results are shown in Table IV&hyph;5. The importance of the findings from this study is
twofold. First, it indicates that the workplace is the primary source of ETS exposure for nonsmokers, who do not live
with smokers. Secondly, it shows that for nonsmokers living with smokers, even though their household environment
becomes their primary source of exposure, the workplace still contributes a substantial amount of exposure, comparable
to that experienced by the nonsmoker living with nonsmokers (29.4 min/day v. 36.1 min/day).

also present results to show significant workplace exposures to ETS. A re-analysis of the CAPS data (a detailed description
of this study is found in the EXPOSURE section) shows that the workplace contributes on the average 46 percent to the
total ETS exposure experienced by a nonsmoking worker.

As mentioned previously, only diseases that have been reported to be significantly associated with ETS exposure
and for which OSHA has access to data will be used in calculating health risk due to occupational exposure to ETS. These
will be referred to as the ``diseases of interest'' and include coronary heart disease (excluding strokes) as defined
in the Framingham study and lung cancer.

Ideally, data on the incidence of the diseases of interest in the U.S. population were needed to estimate the number
of cases of disease in employed nonsmokers. Since nationwide incidence data were not available for nonsmokers, several
survey sources were used to estimate the mortality rates for heart disease (Framingham Community Study) [Ex. 4&hyph;108],
and lung cancer (Cancer Prevention Survey conducted by the American Cancer Society) [Ex. 4&hyph;7]. Data on the U.S.
workforce were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [Ex. 4&hyph;39]. Based on the 1993 annual averages, as
estimated by the Household Survey, BLS reports that the U.S. workforce for sectors covered by this standard is estimated
to be 101,631,300 (men: 54.36%, women: 45.64%). Information on the proportion of employed adults who smoke was obtained
from the National Health Interview Survey and is found in Table IV&hyph;7 [Ex. 4&hyph;235]. It is estimated that 74,201,000
adults (73.01% of the U.S. labor force), employed in sectors covered by this standard, are nonsmokers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to characterize prevalence of occupational exposure, OSHA considered several sources. To determine
the prevalence of smoking among U.S. adults during 1991, the National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion
and Disease Prevention (NHIS&hyph;HPDP) supplement collected self-reported information on smoking exposure
at work from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population greater than 18 years
of age [Ex. 4&hyph;51]. In particular, employed individuals were asked whether, during the past two weeks, anyone
had smoked in their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to reflect national
estimates, 18.81 percent of nonsmokers reported exposure to smoke in their immediate work area as shown in Table IV&hyph;8.
OSHA believes that 18.81 percent may be an underestimate of frequency of exposure in the workplace because it is based
solely on self-reported information and the question was not very specific in defining immediate work area.

Another source considered by OSHA for defining nonsmoker ETS exposure in the workplace was the work published by Cummings
et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67]. A recent re-analysis of the data file showed that among the nonsmoking, currently employed
subjects, 48.67 percent (165 out of 339) reported exposure to ETS at work and not at home (Table IV&hyph;9) [Ex. 4&hyph;69].
Based on the data sources mentioned above, OSHA assumes that the percent of nonsmoking workers who are potentially
exposed to ETS at their worksite ranges between 18.81 and 48.67.

. The U.S. population incidence rate of lung cancer for nonsmoking women is reported to be 0.121 per one thousand nonsmoking
women. The lung cancer incidence for nonsmoking males is estimated to be higher. For the purpose of this risk assessment,
OSHA used 0.121 as the population incidence rate of lung cancer for nonsmokers. This will most likely result in an underestimate
of the true risk for male workers. The average annual incidence rate for death from coronary heart disease excluding
strokes for nonsmokers age 35 to 64 is estimated to be 4 per one thousand men and 2 per one thousand women, as reported
by the Framingham study. This results in an overall weighted average of 3 deaths per one thousand individuals.

OSHA used 1.34 as an observed estimate of relative risk (RR) for lung cancer among nonsmokers with occupational exposure
as reported by Fontham et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;106]. Estimates of observed relative risk for heart disease in nonsmokers,
as reported by Helsing et al. (1.24 for females and 1.31 for males), were used in calculating an overall adjusted relative
risk estimate of 1.28 [Ex. 4&hyph;139]. The adjusted relative risk was a weighted average of the reported relative
risks using the gender composition of the U.S. workforce as weights ((1.24*45.64 + 1.31*54.36/100) = 1.28). The proportion
of nonsmoking workers exposed to ETS while at work (p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was assumed to range from 18.81 to 48.67 as stated previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA chose to rely on the Fontham and Helsing studies for estimates of the observed relative risks for several reasons.
Both studies were conducted in the U.S. Both are large, population-based studies whose results can be generalized
to the general public. Both studies, by design, controlled for misclassification to a large degree. The Helsing study,
which was done in the 60's_a time when smoking was more acceptable than more recently, and being a prospective cohort
study, was less prone to misclassification and other sources of bias. The Fontham study used multiple sources to ascertain
nonsmoking status and validate subject response. Study subjects were questioned twice; the self-reported nonsmoking
status was corroborated by urinary cotinine measurements; and medical records were cross-referenced with the physician's
assessment. In addition, in the Fontham study, information on occupational exposure was collected and an estimate
of lung cancer risk attributable to the workplace exposure was ascertained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual risk of disease attributable to occupational exposure to ETS was estimated by dividing the expected number
of cases (N
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by the number of nonsmoking workers in the U.S. population. Table IV&hyph;10 presents the annual risk attributable
to occupational exposure to ETS per 1,000 exposed employees. Because section (6)(b)(5) of the OSH Act states that
no employee shall suffer ``material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such an employee has regular
exposure to the hazard dealt with *&blank;*&blank;* for the period of his working life'', OSHA has converted the attributable
annual risk into an attributable lifetime risk on the assumption that a worker is employed in his or her occupation
for 45 years. Lifetime estimates of risk attributable to occupational ETS are presented in Table IV&hyph;10. Information
contained in Table IV&hyph;10 indicates that for every 1,000 workers exposed to ETS, approximately 1 will most likely
develop lung cancer and 7 to 16 will develop heart disease if they are exposed to ETS at their workplace in the course
of a 45-year working lifetime. The formula used to calculate lifetime risk estimates the probability of at least one
occurrence of disease in 45 years of continuous exposure and assumes independence of events from year to year. It also
assumes that the worker's exposure profile and working conditions that may affect the level and intensity of exposure
remain constant throughout a working lifetime.

E. OSHA's Risk Estimates_Indoor Air Quality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adverse health effects associated with poor IAQ are described as Building-Related Illness (BRI) and Sick Building
Syndrome (SBS). SBS related conditions are not easily traced to a single specific substance, but are perceived as
resulting from some unidentified contaminant or combination of contaminants. Symptoms are relieved when the employee
leaves the building and may be reduced by modifying the ventilation system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research in Britain [Ex. 4&hyph;44], Denmark [Ex. 4&hyph;284] and the United States [Ex. 3&hyph;745] indicates
that about 20% of all office workers are afflicted with such symptoms. If the 20% level were to be considered as ``background'',
a simple approach would be to determine that any building, more than 20% of whose occupants report the symptoms, would
be considered to be ``sick''. However, the question then arises as to how much greater than 20% would the incidence
have to be to be considered excess and how would one address such issues as statistical significance for any one building.
Furthermore, the definition used in assessing symptom occurrence can cause substantial variations in estimating
symptom prevalence, even in the same building. The problem with many investigations of ``sick'' buildings is that
rarely have ``non-sick'' or control buildings been used to determine background prevalence of the symptoms. Until
now, it appears that limited research has been done to address the issue of background levels of symptoms. OSHA seeks
input on data sources to address expected background levels of SBS related conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mendell and Smith [Ex. 4&hyph;218] examined symptom reports compiled in a number of individual studies for a number
of buildings which had different types of ventilation. On the basis of the information gathered in the individual
studies, Mendell and Smith compared the prevalence of sick building symptoms in buildings with five types of ventilation:
natural only; fans only; air conditioned with no humidification; air conditioned with steam humidification; and
air conditioned with water-based humidification. Overall, they found the prevalence of work-related headache,
lethargy, upper respiratory/mucous membrane, lower respiratory and skin symptoms significantly increased in
buildings with any type of air conditioning as compared to buildings with no air conditioning. Thus, according to
this analysis, a basic problem with SBS appears to reside in the air conditioning system or, in some building aspect
associated with the presence of air-conditioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building-related illness (BRI) describes those specific medical conditions of known etiology which can often be
documented by physical signs and laboratory findings. Symptoms may or may not disappear when the employee leaves
the building. Currently, OSHA does not have any data on BRI related symptoms to conduct a quantitative risk assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of cases of illness in the United States related to poor indoor air quality has not yet been quantified; however
OSHA has made an attempt to develop a preliminary risk estimate of SBS using a similar methodology as was done for ETS.
The National Health Interview Survey was the primary data source for U.S. population frequency rates for acute upper
respiratory symptoms other than the common cold, influenza, acute bronchitis, and pneumonia and frequency rates
on severe headaches other than migraines. For this preliminary risk assessment, OSHA used the reported frequency
rates as representative of population incidence rates for upper respiratory conditions and severe headaches. OSHA
seeks comment on the use of frequency data in place of incidence data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Observed relative risks for comparable conditions were estimated by Mendell [Ex. 4&hyph;219]. Mendell's data source
was the California Healthy Building Study. This study surveyed a representative sample of 12 public office buildings
in Northern California to ascertain the occurrence of work-related symptoms associated with air-conditioned office
buildings. All buildings were either smokefree or had separately ventilated designated smoking areas. The sample
included 6 buildings with air- conditioning systems, 3 buildings with mechanical ventilation and no air-conditioning,
and 3 buildings with natural ventilation. The study included 880 workers. Mendell estimated relative risks for several
building related symptoms and a subset of these estimates are shown in Table IV&hyph;11. In an effort to define comparable
symptoms between the reported national statistics from NHIS and Mendell's study and for computational ease OSHA
grouped ``runny nose'', ``stuffy nose'', ``dry/irritated throat'', and ``dry/irritated/itching eyes'' as upper
respiratory/mucous membrane symptoms. Mendell reported relative risks for upper respiratory conditions and frequent
headaches in air-conditioned buildings as compared to naturally ventilated buildings. The relative risk for frequent
headaches was reported to be 1.5. For upper respiratory conditions, such as ``stuffy nose'', ``runny nose'', etc.,
the relative risks ranged from 1.4 to 1.8. OSHA used 1.4 as an observed relative risk for upper respiratory conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDC reports in the ``Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 1992'' that the annual rate for
severe headaches, requiring medical attention or activity restriction, is at least 5 per thousand and the rate for
upper respiratory conditions is at least 9 per thousand. In addition, it is estimated that the proportion of office
buildings in the U.S. with air-conditioning is 70 percent (see Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis section).
Using the above information and the same methodology as described in section IV-D, OSHA estimated that the lifetime
excess burden for severe headaches experienced in air-conditioned office buildings is 57 per one thousand exposed
employees and the lifetime risk for acute upper respiratory conditions is 85 per one thousand exposed employees.
OSHA's risk estimates for indoor air are shown in Table IV&hyph;12. OSHA used data derived from a study of air-conditioned
office buildings to make an assessment of the occupational risk in all air-conditioned buildings. Furthermore,
OSHA made an implicit assumption that an increase in work-related headaches associated with an air-conditioned
office environment occurs in the same proportion as headaches which can be severe enough to affect work activity.
OSHA seeks comment on the applicability of the Mendell study for estimating occupational risk in air-conditioned
buildings due to poor indoor air quality. In addition, OSHA seeks comment on its methodology of developing annual
and lifetime risk estimates attributable to occupational exposures.

F. Pharmacokinetic Modeling of ETS Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing a final rule, OSHA would like to consider the use of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
model in an effort to develop a clear and complete picture of factors that may affect environmental exposure measurements,
internal dose estimates and ultimately estimates of expected risk attributed to ETS exposure at the workplace. OSHA
is seeking comment on appropriate methodology, available data, etc. The following discussion offers an explanation
of OSHA's approach to this issue and an opportunity for the Agency to solicit comment on specific points of concern
as they relate to the use of pharmacokinetics in estimating occupational risk from exposure to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimating the risk from exposure to ETS requires the use of some measure of the extent of exposure. Possible measures,
or metrics, can range from categorical ranking based on survey responses to direct measurement of ETS-related chemicals
in the body fluids of exposed individuals. In general, the use of an internal measure of individual exposure would
be preferred over measurements of environmental contamination, such as airborne chemical or particulate concentrations.
In particular, considerable attention has been given in the scientific literature to the possible use of cotinine
concentrations in body fluids as a biomarker of ETS exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;146, 4&hyph;165, 4&hyph;263,
4&hyph;316]. However, obtaining a dependable estimate of exposure from measurements of a chemical's concentration
in body fluids requires a quantitative understanding of the chemical's pharmacokinetics; its uptake, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion. Following is a review of the evidence concerning the suitability of cotinine as an internal
biomarker for ETS exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Considerations for Selection of a Biomarker for ETS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A biomarker should, to the greatest extent possible, accurately represent the individual's exposure to the substance
of concern and have relevance to a specific endpoint. In the case of ETS, there are several relevant endpoints, with
principal attention being given to heart disease and lung cancer. Each different endpoint may be mediated by a different
subset of the components of ETS, and therefore the appropriate biomarker(s) for each endpoint could be different.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Cardiovascular Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cardiovascular effects resulting from exposure to ETS have been associated with carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine,
and more recently with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [Ex. 4&hyph;123]. Each of these is associated with
a different fraction of ETS; CO is a gas phase constituent, nicotine is a low volatility vapor, and PAHs are absorbed
on particulates. Because of the significant differences in physical fate and transport, a strategy for the use of
biomarkers for cardiovascular effects of ETS would ideally make use of separate markers for CO, nicotine, and PAHs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most common internal measure of CO exposure is blood carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO). Blood HbCO provides a useful measure
of exposure to CO, and can be related to the cardiovascular effects of CO. A way to determine the occupational component
of one's total CO exposure is to measure workplace CO levels and predict blood HbCO with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic
model for CO [Ex. 4&hyph;11]. A difficulty associated with the use of CO or HbCO as a biomarker for ETS effects is the
presence of other sources of CO in the workplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nicotine can be measured directly in body fluids and the circulating concentration can be related to physiological
effects, such as heart rate [Ex. 4&hyph;26]. Alternatively, measurements of nicotine in air or cotinine in body fluids
can be measured, and the circulating concentration of nicotine can be inferred using a pharmacokinetic model. The
use of a pharmacokinetic model to relate inhaled nicotine to circulating nicotine and cotinine levels is the main
focus of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PAHs are inhaled in the form of particulates on which they are adsorbed. Developing an appropriate biomarker for ETS-associated
PAHs is complicated by the presence of PAHs on particulates not associated with ETS, and by the low, and variable, composition
of PAHs adsorbed to particulate matter. One candidate material which has been suggested as an environmental marker
for ETS-associated particulates is solanesol, a non-volatile tobacco constituent. However, the pharmacokinetic
information necessary for use of solanesol as an internal biomarker is not currently available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of these three different biomarkers (CO, PAHs, and solanesol) does not appear to be practical. It appears that
the most effective strategy currently achievable would be to rely on nicotine (or cotinine) measurement as a specific
marker of ETS exposure as well as a direct measure of nicotine exposure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Carcinogenicity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mechanism of carcinogenicity from exposure to ETS is not known, but it has been established that ETS includes a
number of chemicals which have been identified as carcinogens (see Tables II&hyph;2, III&hyph;6, and III&hyph;7),
although most of the identified carcinogenic components of ETS are not unique to ETS. Therefore, direct measurement
of the carcinogenic components or related biomarkers in biological fluids would not provide a unique measure of exposure
from ETS. The potentially carcinogenic components of ETS include highly volatile chemicals such as formaldehyde
and benzene, lower volatility chemicals such as the nitrosamines, and non-volatile chemicals such as PAHs and metal
compounds, which are bound to particulates. Given the current lack of information on the mechanism of carcinogenicity
of ETS it is impossible to identify which components of ETS should be targeted for exposure estimation. The most prudent
choice for a biomarker in this case would be one which provides the most general representation of all the components
of ETS, and which is itself unique to ETS. In an experimental study of potential ETS-unique environmental markers
of exposure, only nicotine was found to represent both the gas phase and particulate phase organic constituent of
ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;97]. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between measurements of nicotine in the air
and the mutagenicity of ETS [Exs. 4&hyph;198, 4&hyph;215]. In these studies, the relationship of nicotine to mutagenicity
was as good as or better than the relationship of RSP to mutagenicity (RSP is assumed to be the major contributor of the
carcinogenic effects of ETS). Therefore, since measurements of nicotine in the air correlate better than measurements
of RSP to mutagenicity of ETS, and there is a positive correlation between short-term mutagenicity tests and carcinogenicity,
the use of nicotine as an exposure marker for the carcinogenic effects of ETS appears to be justified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Evaluation of Cotinine as a Biomarker for ETS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section is to discuss the use of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, as an internal biomarker for
inhalation exposure to nicotine, and, as such, its usefulness as a metric for the health effects of ETS. Cotinine is
preferred over nicotine as an internal biomarker because of its slower clearance from the body [Ex. 4&hyph;71].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a strong correlation between nicotine intake and plasma cotinine levels [Ex. 4&hyph;115]. There is also
a strong correlation between cotinine measured in body fluids and ETS exposure. In a controlled study, urinary cotinine
was found to be a reliable marker for long-term ETS exposure, and plasma and salivary cotinine were found to be good
indicators of short- as well as long-term exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;73]. Several studies have also demonstrated a positive
relationship between self-reported exposure to ETS and cotinine in serum [Exs. 4&hyph;166, 4&hyph;250, 4&hyph;301],
saliva [Ex. 4&hyph;166], and urine [Exs. 4&hyph;166, 4&hyph;211, 4&hyph;316]. In general, the currently available
data support the assumption that nicotine and cotinine kinetics parameters for smokers can be extrapolated to nonsmokers
for estimating exposures to ETS in nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;24]. Studies have also demonstrated that salivary levels
of cotinine are directly proportional to plasma levels [Ex. 4&hyph;73], and that urinary excretion of cotinine is
linearly related to plasma levels [Ex. 4&hyph;82]. Thus all three biological fluids provide a reasonable metric
for nicotine intake, and thus can serve as biomarkers of ETS exposure in nonsmokers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two potential difficulties associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker for ETS. The first is the presence
of nicotine in the diet. Several foods, including tea, tomatoes, and potatoes, have been shown to contain nicotine
in measurable quantities [Exs. 4&hyph;49, 4&hyph;81, 4&hyph;281]. However, a study of 3,383 nonsmokers was unable
to substantiate an effect of tea drinking on serum cotinine levels for self-reported daily tea consumption [Ex. 4&hyph;301].
The same study did find a strong correlation between self-reported ETS exposure and serum cotinine level.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA seeks comment and data on whether dietary intake of nicotine should be considered a significant factor in modelling
nicotine metabolism for assessing risk due to ETS exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second issue associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker is the possibility that there is a longer half-life
for the elimination of cotinine at very low biological concentrations, associated with the slow release of nicotine
from binding sites [Exs. 4&hyph;28, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;167, 4&hyph;254]. This longer half-life at very low concentrations
could have the effect of overestimating exposure to ETS in the lowest exposed population. At this time there is not
sufficient evidence to quantify the potential magnitude of this effect, but it is likely to be small. OSHA seeks comment
on this issue.

5. Description of Pharmacokinetic Models for Nicotine and Cotinine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For many purposes, an essentially first order process such as the kinetics of cotinine can be effectively modeled
with a simple compartmental kinetic analysis [Exs. 4&hyph;27, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82]. The compartmental
approach has been used to relate steady-state urinary cotinine levels to atmospheric nicotine concentrations [Ex.
4&hyph;263]. For investigating some of the concerns associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker, however,
a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) description would be preferred. The advantage of the PBPK approach
stems from its biologically motivated structure, which permits the direct incorporation of biochemical data and
the biologically constrained comparison of model predictions with experimental timecourses to investigate such
issues as dose-rate effects, exposure-route differences, pharmacodynamic processes, and other potential nonlinearities
[Ex. 4&hyph;57]. PBPK models of nicotine and cotinine have been described for both rats [Exs. 4&hyph;112, 4&hyph;255]
and humans [Exs. 4&hyph;254, 4&hyph;270].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physiological model of cotinine disposition [Ex. 4&hyph;112] was developed to analyze intravenous infusion of
nicotine and cotinine and bolus dosing of cotinine in rats. In general, the observed cotinine time profiles in blood
and tissues were consistent with linear kinetics, but the distribution of cotinine into all tissues appeared to be
roughly three-fold greater following infusion of nicotine than following infusion of cotinine, and the clearance
of cotinine following bolus and infusion dosing was significantly different.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more recent rat model [Ex. 255] featured a physiologically based description of nicotine kinetics and a compartmental
description of cotinine. This model provided a successful description of the plasma kinetics of both nicotine and
cotinine for intraarterial or intravenous bolus dosing of nicotine. The timecourse of nicotine in most tissues was
also consistent with first order kinetics; however, it was necessary to include a description of saturable nicotine
binding in the brain, heart, and lung to adequately reproduce nicotine concentration profiles in these tissues.
This rat model has also been scaled for use in predicting mouse and human pharmacokinetics [Ex. 4&hyph;254]. The human
model has recently been expanded to include a physiological description of cotinine as well as a forearm compartment,
and is now able to describe nicotine and cotinine kinetics following intravenous infusion of nicotine in humans [Ex.
4&hyph;266]. Another human model [Ex. 4&hyph;270] has also been developed which includes physiological descriptions
of both nicotine and cotinine. This model, which assumes linear kinetics, predicts results which agree with published
data on the kinetics of nicotine and cotinine in blood following nicotine infusion as well as cotinine in the blood
following the infusion of cotinine.

6. Application of Pharmacokinetic Modeling for ETS Exposure Estimation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both of the human models described above possess a reasonable biologically based structure, and either model would
provide a useful starting point for the development of a PBPK model which could be of use in examining the relationship
between cotinine concentrations in body fluids and inhaled nicotine. However, neither of the models currently possesses
all of the features which would be necessary for such an analysis. The most useful application of PBPK modeling would
appear to be to support an analysis of four issues related to the use of cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure: (1) Estimation
of the contribution of dietary intake of nicotine to cotinine levels in the plasma, saliva and urine of nonsmokers;
(2) Estimation of a plausible upper bound for cotinine concentrations in plasma, saliva and urine associated with
ETS exposure (to identify individuals wrongfully identifying themselves as nonsmokers). This can be viewed as a
way to validate misclassification results derived from surveys; (3) Evaluation of the potential impact of high affinity,
low capacity binding of nicotine and cotinine in nonsmokers with low exposure to ETS; and (4) Evaluation of the potential
impact of pharmacokinetic uncertainty and variability on the use of cotinine concentrations in plasma, saliva or
urine to infer an individual's ETS exposure. The necessary features for accomplishing these analyses include both
inhalation and oral routes of nicotine exposure, a salivary compartment, and a description of nicotine binding in
the brain, heart and lung.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the use of cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure, two kinds of uncertainty must be considered. The first
kind of uncertainty embraces those factors which could tend to bias a risk estimate. Two such factors are dietary intake
of nicotine and nicotine binding. In both of these cases, the impact of ignoring the effect, if it were significant,
would be to overestimate exposure (and therefore risk) for the least exposed individuals. The second kind of uncertainty
includes those factors which tend to broaden the confidence interval for the risk estimate. The most significant
factors in this category are uncertainty in the fraction of nicotine converted to free cotinine, and the rates of metabolic
and urinary clearance of nicotine and cotinine. An example of such uncertainty is results reported for half-lives
of cotinine in nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;186], showing a mean of 16.2
hours, with a coefficient of variation of 0.22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Analysis of Uncertainty
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is useful in this evaluation to distinguish uncertainty from variability. As it relates to the issue of using pharmacokinetic
modeling in risk assessment, uncertainty can be defined as the possible error in estimating the ``true'' value of
a parameter for a representative (``average'') individual. Variability, on the other hand, represents differences
from individual to individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of evaluating the usefulness of pharmacokinetic modeling for estimating exposure, the uncertainty
and variability in the various parameters for the pharmacokinetic models can be grouped into four classes: the physiological
parameters (volumes and flows), the tissue distribution parameters (partitioning and binding), and the kinetic
parameters (absorption, metabolism, and clearance).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Physiological Parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The physiological parameters include (1) the body weight and the weights of the individual organs or tissue groups,
(2) the total blood flow and flows to each organ or tissue group, and (3) the alveolar ventilation rate. These quantities
have been reasonably well established for the human [Exs. 4&hyph;155, 4&hyph;309] and the chief effort associated
with pharmacokinetic model parameterization in the human is the determination of the necessary level of detail for
the physiological description, grouping of the tissues not meriting a separate description into pharmacokinetically
similar groups, and the association of the proper volume and flow data with the selected groupings. Existing models
for nicotine and cotinine contain a fairly detailed physiological structure and differ only slightly in their assignment
of tissues. The model of Plowchalk and deBethizy [Ex. 4&hyph;254] includes separate compartments for the brain,
heart, and skin. The first two of these tissues are lumped into a ``vessel-rich'' tissue compartment in the model of
Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;270], and the skin is lumped in with the muscle. Conversely, the gastrointestinal tract
is given a separate compartment in the Robinson model but is lumped into a ``slowly perfused'' tissue compartment
in the Plowchalk model. These differences mainly reflect the different interests of the modeling groups in terms
of target organs and routes of exposure. The Robinson model contains a venous infusion compartment to accommodate
the mixing time for arterial administration. The published Plowchalk model does not include this feature, but a forearm
compartment has since been added to provide a similar function [Ex. 4&hyph;83]. Neither model appears to contain
an explicit description of inhalation or oral exposure, but the necessary equations could easily be added to the existing
physiological structures. A salivary fluid compartment could also be added to either model if desired. Experience
with other chemicals has shown that uncertainty in the physiological parameters generally has much less impact on
overall model uncertainty because they are known relatively well and are not as influential on model behavior as the
distribution and kinetic parameters [Ex. 4&hyph;56].

(b) Distributional Parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In both of the published human models, the tissue partitioning was initially estimated on the basis of steady-state
tissue/blood concentration ratios measured in animals. The partitioning parameters in the Robinson model were
then iteratively adjusted to fit other timecourse data. The resulting partition coefficients in the two models differ
by a factor from two to five in corresponding tissues. The partitioning data for cotinine, determined by Gabrelsson
and Bondesson [Ex. 4&hyph;112], show a similar level of uncertainty; partitions for cotinine following infusion
of nicotine were two- to five-fold higher than the same partitions following infusion of cotinine. The lack of reproducibility
of these data represents a deficiency in the development of PBPK modeling for these chemicals. Fortunately, the partition
coefficients tend to be less important than the kinetic parameters in terms of overall model performance. To a large
extent, as long as the volume of distribution associated with the physiological structure and partition coefficients
is in agreement with the apparent pharmacokinetic volume of distribution for each chemical, the model will perform
adequately in terms of timecourses in blood and urine. This was evidenced by the ability of the Robinson model to reproduce
published nicotine and cotinine pharmacokinetic data [Ex. 4&hyph;270]. A potentially more significant uncertainty
associated with distribution is the possibility of pharmacokinetically significant tissue binding of nicotine.
Satisfactory description of the timecourse of nicotine in the brain, lung, and heart of the rat required the inclusion
of binding in these tissues [Ex. 4&hyph;255]. Clearly, the relatively low capacity, high affinity binding associated
with nicotine is unlikely to effect total systemic clearance except at very low concentrations. However, the existence
of nonlinear pharmacokinetics at low concentrations could lead to a miscalculation of exposure for the least exposed
individuals. It has been suggested that there is a longer clearance half-life for nicotine, and therefore cotinine,
associated with low circulating concentrations, and that this longer half-life is due to the slower release of nicotine
bound to tissues [Exs. 4&hyph;28, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;167]. To date, no careful pharmacokinetic investigation of
this possibility has been performed in the human model, and adequate nicotine-specific tissue binding information
does not appear to have been collected except perhaps in the brain.

(c) Kinetic Parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By far the most significant parameters in the models are those describing the absorption, metabolism, and clearance
of nicotine and cotinine. The Robinson model uses reported human hepatic and renal clearance values for nicotine
and cotinine. The sensitivity of this model to these input parameters was investigated by varying them within the
range of reported clearance values from infusion studies in humans. The resulting model predictions for post-infusion
blood levels, urinary output, and the elimination half-lives of both nicotine and cotinine were found to be well within
the ranges of those observed in human studies. Thus the model structure does not produce an exaggerated response to
variation of the input parameters, and reflects the natural interaction between measures of clearance, volume of
distribution, and rates of elimination. In the case of the physiological parameters, variability dominates over
uncertainty, while for the distributional parameters, uncertainty dominates. In the case of the kinetic parameters
describing clearance, it appears that variability again dominates. For example, the mean values for the terminal
half-life of cotinine reported in different studies range from 12 to 21 hours in non-smokers [Exs. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73,
4&hyph;82, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;186]. The coefficient of variation in these same studies, a measure of interindividual
variability, ranges from 17&hyph;22%, and the coefficient of variation for the entire collection of reported individual
values is similar: 22% (N=35, mean=16.2). A review of the published data on infusion of nicotine and cotinine in humans
[Ex. 4&hyph;270] found a 3-fold variation in reported half-lives for cotinine. For comparison, the variation in
the volume of distribution for cotinine was 5-fold, while for the half-life and volume of distribution of nicotine,
the variation was 8-fold and 6-fold, respectively. An even greater level of variability can be expected for the kinetic
parameters for the renal clearance of nicotine and cotinine.

OSHA considers the use of pharmacokinetics and specifically PBPK models an important tool in characterizing and

in ascertaining the relationship between adverse health effects and exposure to ETS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Agency's responsibility to determine in the first instance what it considers to be a ``significant'' risk.
Some risks are plainly acceptable and others are plainly unacceptable. If, for example, the odds are one in a billion
that a person will die from cancer by taking a drink of chlorinated water, the risk clearly could not be considered significant.
On the other hand, if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalation of gasoline vapors that are 2% benzene will
be fatal, a reasonable person might well consider the risk significant and take the appropriate steps to decrease
or eliminate it. (

A. Environmental Tobacco Smoke
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the adverse health effects associated with exposure to ETS are lung cancer and heart disease (coronary heart
disease, excluding strokes). Clinically, lung cancer is almost always fatal. However, heart disease runs the gamut
from severe to disabling to fatal. Both of these diseases then constitute the type of ``material impairment of health
or functional capacity'' which the Act seeks to reduce or eliminate. Therefore a standard aimed at reducing the incidence
of these impairments is an appropriate exercise of the Secretary's regulatory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case before us the Agency estimates that there will be approximately between 144 and 722 cases of lung cancer
per year among nonsmoking American workers exposed to ETS in the workplace. When considered over a working lifetime,
this translates into an excess lung cancer rate in the workplace of one per thousand. As noted above, the Benzene court
clearly indicated that a risk of one in a thousand could be considered significant and that the Agency would be justified
in prescribing reasonable efforts to reduce such a risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the risk from lung cancer associated with worker exposure to ETS in the workplace meets the Benzene court's
characterization of what could be considered significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in evaluating the significance of the risk posed by any particular workplace hazard, the Secretary is
entitled to take into consideration not only the rate of risk but the total number of workers exposed to such risk and
the absolute magnitude of effects. In this case, evidence in the record shows that approximately between 144 and 722
lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to ETS and that there are presently over 74 million nonsmoking American
workers exposed to ETS in their places of employment. On the basis of these data, it would also be reasonable to conclude
that Agency action is warranted to reduce this widespread and significant risk, although the Agency would reach this
conclusion even without the great magnitude of effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, cancer is not the only serious adverse health effect associated with exposure to ETS. Preliminary
estimates indicate that the risk of mortality from heart disease due to ETS exposure is even greater than that of cancer.
The Agency estimates that there will be between 2,094 and 13,000 deaths from heart disease per year among nonsmoking
American workers exposed to ETS in the workplace. When considered over a working lifetime, this translates into an
excess death rate of approximately between 7 and 16 cases of heart disease per thousand attributed to workplace exposure
to ETS. Clearly, this risk is significant in itself and combined with the lung cancer risk, the significance of risk
is very great. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal seeks to protect nonsmoking employees from the hazards of exposure to ETS in the workplace. It does this
by prescribing the conditions under which employees would be allowed to smoke in the workplace, that is, only in separately
enclosed designated areas which are separately ventilated. No employee can be required to work in an area where there
will be contamination from ETS. This in OSHA's view reduces significant risk to only a small percentage of the current
risk. To the extent that there are failures of enforcement of the smoking limitation and of the ventilation system,
the risk will not be totally eliminated. Since there is no definition of, nor an established method for quantifying,
exposure, it is not possible to determine a ``dose limit'' that would eliminate significant risk. Even if that were
possible, it is not clear it would be the correct policy approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 CFR Part 1990_Identification, Classification and Regulation of Potential Occupational Carcinogens sets forth
certain procedures for regulating occupational carcinogens. Those procedures may not allow for the level of public
input and policy review that is appropriate for this rulemaking, involving many different types of health effects
and a broad range of employers and workers. Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary finds pursuant to 29 CFR Section
1911.4 that ``in order to provide greater procedural protections to interested persons or for other good cause consistent
with the applicable laws'' ``it is found necessary or appropriate'' to adopt different procedures here.

B. Indoor Air Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Poor indoor air quality creates a variety of material impairments of health, two aspects of which are Building-Related
Illness and Sick Building Syndrome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most severe health effects associated with Building-Related Illness is legionellosis, a disease associated
with microbial contamination of water sources which is commonly found in the water present in heating and cooling
systems of buildings. Legionnaire's disease, caused by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
organism, results in pneumonia which is fatal in approximately 20% of the cases. Even when not fatal, it is usually
very severe, requiring substantial treatment or hospitalization. As many as 5% of those exposed to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Legionnaire's disease and other illnesses associated with microbial contamination due to poor indoor air quality
are serious health effects that constitute material impairment. Compliance with the indoor air quality provisions
set forth in the proposal will substantially reduce these illnesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Raw figures from 1992 show approximately 1300 cases of Legionella reported although this is most certainly a gross
under-estimation of the scope of the problem, since the disease resembles others and is frequently misdiagnosed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are numerous other adverse health effects such as nausea, dizziness, fatigue, pulmonary edema, asthma and
aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease, which have been associated with poor indoor air quality. Evidence
in the record indicates that between 20 and 30% of office buildings are ``sick'', having environments which may lead
to a variety of these effects. Unfortunately, quantitative data are not systematically available on all of these
effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of risk evaluation, however, as explained more fully in the risk assessment discussion, the Agency has
primarily focussed on two health effects commonly associated with poor indoor air quality: upper respiratory symptoms
and severe headaches. The upper respiratory symptoms associated with poor indoor air quality (sick building syndrome)
include stuffy nose, runny nose, dry itchy eyes, nose and throat. For purposes of our evaluation, ``severe headaches''
are defined as those serious enough to require medical attention or restrict activity, but excludes migraines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike lung cancer and heart disease (health effects associated with exposure to ETS), these effects will not lead
to death. There is no doubt, however, that OSHA does have the authority to regulate working conditions that lead to
the type of upper respiratory effects and severe headaches described herein.

Clearly the upper respiratory effects and severe headaches associated with poor indoor air quality are of the type
that interfere with the performance of work. The severe headaches were such that medical treatment had to be sought;
certainly such headaches were impairing at the time they occurred, even though they were not permanent. The upper
respiratory symptoms were also severe enough to either require medical attention or restrict activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is ample precedent in OSHA rulemaking proceedings for the regulation of working conditions to avoid health
impairments that are material but not life threatening. The Supreme Court in the cotton dust case,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concluded that OSHA had the authority to promulgate regulations that would avoid Byssinosis, a respiratory disease
which in the large majority of cases is not deadly or disabling, and is reversible if the employee left the cotton mills.
Stage 1/2 byssinosis, the most frequent type, has relatively mild symptoms. In the case of occupational exposure
to formaldehyde, the regulation was designed to avoid, among other things, sensory irritation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore OSHA concludes that the adverse health effects caused by poor indoor air quality, which range from legionellosis
to severe headaches to upper respiratory symptoms are material impairments of health which the Act allows the Agency
to regulate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects of the pneumonia caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are deadly or severe. Although the rate of risk may not be as large as 1/1000 because the number of employees at risk is
large. This effect alone makes a substantial contribution to a finding of significant risk, especially when taking
into account the large number of cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the severe headaches, the Agency estimates that the excess risk of developing the type of non-migraine headache
which may need medical attention or restrict activity which has been associated with poor indoor air quality is 57
per 1,000 exposed employees. In addition the excess risk of developing upper respiratory symptoms which are severe
enough to require medical attention or restrict activity is estimated to be 85 per 1,000 exposed employees. These
numbers are extrapolated from actual field studies and therefore show the magnitude of the problem at present. There
is no doubt that better maintenance of ventilation systems such as required in the proposal will improve the quality
of air in covered workplaces and reduce the number of cases. In addition the types of good practices prescribed in the
proposal will substantially reduce the type of microbial contamination associated with Legionnaire's disease.
Therefore, OSHA concludes that this number of less severe effects along with the severe effects from Legionnaire's
disease, together, constitute a significant risk. Accordingly, OSHA preliminarily concludes that, the proposal
will substantially reduce a significant risk of material impairment of health from poor indoor air quality.

VI. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12886 requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis to be prepared
for any regulation that meets the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action.'' One of these criteria, relevant
to this rulemaking is that the rule have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more per year. Based upon the preliminary
analysis presented below, OSHA finds that the proposed standard will constitute a significant regulatory action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimates presented in this Phase 1 Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis demonstrate technological and economic
feasibility of the proposed standard. The analysis provides a non-detailed preliminary count of the affected employees
and buildings, the associated costs, and benefits of the proposed standard provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA estimates the annual cost of compliance with the IAQ standard to be $8.1 billion, of which the most costly provision
will be for the building systems operation and maintenance, $8.0 billion. The cost for eliminating exposure to ETS
may range from $0 to $68 million depending on whether establishments ban smoking or allow smoking in designated areas.
In order to assess the overall economic impact of the rule, OSHA also estimated the cost savings to employers, or cost
savings that will result from the implementation of the proposed standard. The major forms of these savings are efficiency
and productivity improvements, cost reductions in operations and maintenance, and reduced incidence of property
damage. Cost savings associated with productivity improvements are estimated to be $15 billion annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA preliminarily estimates that the proposed standard will prevent 3.0 million severe headaches and 4.5 million
upper respiratory symptoms over the next 45 years. This is, approximately, 69,000 severe headaches and 105,000 upper
respiratory symptoms per year. These estimates understate the prevalence of building-related symptoms since they
reflect excess risk in only air conditioned buildings. In addition, 5,583 to 32,502 lung cancer deaths and 97,700
to 577,818 coronary heart disease deaths related to occupational exposure to ETS will be prevented over the next 45
years. This represents 140 to 722 lung cancer deaths per year and 2,094 to 13,001 heart disease deaths per year.

B. Industry Profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental concern for air pollution has been largely focussed on questions of outdoor air contamination.
Recently, however, attention has begun to shift to concerns about the quality of air within buildings since people
spend 80 to 90 percent of their time indoors [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indoor air is a variable complex mixture of chemicals and airborne particles. Its composition largely depends on
the outdoor environment (urban or rural area), the shelter itself (age, construction material, electric equipment,
heating, cooling, and ventilation systems), the activities of the occupants (smoking, nonsmoking, cooking by gas,
oil or electricity) and the presence of plants and animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industry Profile chapter characterizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building stock and describes the factors that affect indoor air quality. This section also presents the number of
employees who work in buildings whose indoor air will be affected by the proposed standard.

The standard covers all OSHA regulated industries: Agriculture, Oil and Gas Extraction (SIC 13), Manufacturing,
Transportation, Communications, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Finance, Insurance and Real Estate and Services.
The scope of the proposal is twofold. The proposed indoor air quality compliance provisions would only cover employers
with non-industrial work environments. This includes public and private buildings, schools, healthcare facilities,
offices and office areas. Coverage also applies to nonindustrial work environments that are part of industrial worksites
(e.g., an office, cafeteria, or break room located at a manufacturing facility). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions for protecting the nonsmoking employees from exposure to ETS apply to all indoor or enclosed work environments,
in industrial and nonindustrial establishments. This would include maritime, construction, and agricultural
workplaces.

Indoor air contaminants emanate from a broad array of sources that can originate both outside of structures as well
as from within a building. When a building is new, some contaminants are given off quickly and soon disappear. Others
continue off-gassing at a slow pace for years. Common office supplies and equipment have been found to release hazardous
chemicals_especially duplicators and copiers. Bulk paper stores have been found to release formaldehyde [Ex. 3&hyph;1087A20].
Some typical contaminants are listed below:

People contribute millions of particles to the indoor air primarily through the shedding of skin scales. Many of these
scales carry microbes, most of which are short lived and harmless. Clothing, furnishings, draperies, carpets, etc.
contribute fibers and other fragments. Cleaning processes, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting normally remove the larger
particles, but often increase the airborne concentrations of the smaller particles. Cooking, broiling, grilling,
gas and oil burning, smoking, coal and wood generate vast numbers of airborne indoor pollutants in various classifications.

3. Controlling Indoor Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Control of pollutants at the source is the most effective strategy for maintaining clean indoor air. However, control
or mitigation of all sources is not always possible or practical. In the case of ETS, this means restricting smoking
to separately ventilated spaces. General ventilation is, therefore, the second most effective approach to providing
acceptable indoor air [Exs. 3&hyph;1061G, 3&hyph;1075J].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Outside air dilutes and removes contaminants through natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation or through infiltration
and exfiltration. Natural ventilation occurs when desired air flows occur through windows, doors, chimneys and
other building openings. Mechanical ventilation is the mechanically induced movement of air through the building.
Mechanical systems usually condition and filter the air and allow for the entry of outdoor air through outdoor dampers.
Infiltration is the unwanted movement of air through cracks and openings into the building shell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outside air ventilation rate of a building affects indoor air quality. It determines the extent to which contaminants
are diluted and removed from the indoor environment. The extent to which outside air ventilation is effective in diluting
indoor contaminants depends on how well outside air is mixed with indoor air and is reflected by ventilation efficiency.
Ventilation efficiency can be reduced by air short-circuiting from the supply diffusers to the return inlets, by
modular furniture partitions, and differences between the supply air temperature and the room air temperature.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate at which outside air is supplied to a building is specified by the building code at the design stage. Outside
air ventilation rates are based primarily on the need to control odors and carbon dioxide levels (e.g., occupant-generated
contaminants or bioeffluents). Carbon dioxide is a component of outdoor air whose excessive accumulation indoors
can indicate inadequate ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lack of adequate ventilation contributes to indoor air related health complaints. Specific deficiencies that produce
air quality problems include inadequate outside air supply, poor air distribution, poor air mixing (and therefore
poor ventilation efficiency), inadequate control of humidity, insufficient maintenance of the ventilation system,
inadequate HVAC system capacity and inadequate exhaust from occupied areas. Inadequate outdoor air supply and distribution
and insufficient control of thermal conditions can result from strategies to control energy consumption. In approximately
500 indoor air quality investigations conducted in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) found that the primary causes of indoor air quality problems were inadequate ventilation
(52%), contamination from outside the building (10%), microbial contamination (5%), contamination from building
fabric (4%) and unknown sources (13%) [56 FR 47892]. To date, NIOSH has conducted over 1,100 IAQ related investigations,
but has not yet evaluated them to provide updated estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA, therefore, believes that it is necessary to require maintenance of the HVAC system components that directly
affect IAQ, since failure to do so results in the degradation of IAQ. Standards of HVAC maintenance vary and sometimes
are deficient where untrained personnel are designated to maintain complex systems. It is, also, customary for companies
to defer maintenance for economic and budgetary reasons, with adverse impacts on IAQ. Some examples of maintenance
deficiencies include: plugged drains on cooling coil condensate drip pans (resulting in microbial contamination);
failed exhaust fans in underground parking garages; microbial fouling of cooling tower water from lack of water treatment
with biocides resulting in legionellosis cases; and failure of the automatic temperature control system resulting
in lack of outside ventilation air.

4. Building Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the last 25 years, technical and socioeconomic changes have profoundly influenced the methods employed to
plan, design, construct and operate buildings. Buildings system design, maintenance and operation can, and regularly
do, provide acceptable indoor environments. However, neglect or disregard of the sources of indoor air contaminants,
or of the proper design, operation and maintenance of building system components which influence indoor air quality
can create an uncomfortable and unhealthy indoor atmosphere [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H2]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The oil embargo of 1973 brought about the realization that considerable savings could be made in reducing the consumption
of energy used to heat and cool buildings. Prior to 1973, the energy to heat and cool buildings was much cheaper and the
buildings reflected that reality. Building enclosures had lower insulating values and allowed more infiltration.
More air was circulated to the occupied spaces and more outdoor air was provided for ventilation. This resulted in
a lower concentration of pollutants and higher velocities of air motion in indoor air. Office buildings were divided
into individual rooms with their own walls as opposed to the current practice of open spaces with movable screens [Ex.
4&hyph;74]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The centralization of services and the expanding economy have led to concentration of office space in the cities.
The cost of land has shaped buildings into high-rise structures. The cost of materials and popularity of mirror glass
has led to the sprouting of hundreds of what may be termed ``glass boxes''. These boxes are sealed to keep out noise and
pollution_mainly from traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Buildings designed after 1973 have incorporated many energy conservation measures that range from adjusting thermal
comfort zones to increased awareness of lighting efficiency, to designing new operating methods for ``sealed building''
[Ex.3&hyph;1159, p.1]. In large buildings, outside air ventilation rates were also reduced by closing outside air
dampers in mechanical ventilation systems at nights, on weekends and sometimes even during occupancy. As a result
of these measures, which primarily reduced costs for conditioning outdoor air as opposed to increasing energy efficiency,
considerable energy savings have been achieved in buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, during the 1970's variable air volume (VAV) HVAC systems became widely accepted. VAV systems condition
supply air to a constant temperature and insure thermal comfort by varying the airflow. Early VAV systems did not allow
control of the outside air quantity, so that a decreasing amount of outside air was provided as the flow of supply air
was reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, building design flaws contribute to the poor quality of indoor air, such as locating air intake vents
near to a loading dock or parking garage. Design flaws of interior space also contribute to indoor air problems. Most
building cooling systems are designed to remove the heat generated by office machines, employees and light. The heat
generated by these sources often exceeds the capacity of the HVAC system to remove it [Ex.3&hyph;1159C1]. Ideally
with effective filtration and management systems, the air indoors should be cleaner than the air outdoors.

Estimates of the number of buildings potentially affected by the indoor air standard were developed by OSHA based
on Department of Energy's commercial building energy consumption survey (CBEC) 1989
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 [Ex. 4&hyph;303]. There is a total of 4.5 million commercial buildings in the United States. Commercial buildings
are defined as all non-manufacturing/industrial and non-residential structures. Table VI&hyph;1 presents the
distribution of buildings by use, occupancy and thermal conditioning. Approximately 28 percent of all buildings
are for mercantile or services. Other uses include offices (15 percent), assembly and warehouses (14 percent each),
food service (5 percent), lodging (3 percent) and food sales and healthcare (2 percent each). The ``other'' category
(1 percent) covers buildings such as public restrooms and buildings that are 50 percent or more commercial but whose
principal activity is agricultural, industrial/manufacturing or residential.

and their energy suppliers. This survey is the only source of national level-data on both commercial building characteristics
and energy consumption.

On average, the largest types of buildings are for education and health care. Mercantile and service buildings account
for the greatest number and floorspace of any single activity category. Office buildings account for nearly as much
floorspace, but far fewer buildings. Together office and mercantile buildings represent almost 40 percent of all
buildings and floorspace. Warehouses and assembly buildings both are almost as numerous as office buildings, but
account for less floorspace. Over 62 percent of buildings have only one floor and 13 percent have three or more floors.
Most buildings (69%) house single establishments. Government occupied buildings represent 13 percent.

The survey also provides information on the number of buildings with heating and air conditioning systems. Total
number of heated buildings is estimated to be 3.9 million. Heating systems include boilers, furnaces, individual
space heaters, and packaged heating units. Almost one-half of all the buildings are heated by forced-air central
systems. Air-distributing heat and cooling systems are most prevalent in office, mercantile and service buildings.
The survey reveals that 70 percent of the buildings have air conditioning. It also shows that 80 percent of the buildings
have heat and air conditioning, and 12 percent have heat, but no air conditioning.

Over 40 percent of the floorspace built since 1986 was in a building with a computerized energy management and control
systems (EMCS). EMCS is an energy conservation feature that uses mini/micro computers, instrumentation, control
equipment and software to manage a building's use of energy for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting
and/or business related processes. These systems can also manage fire control, safety and security. Overall, EMCS
are present in buildings accounting for 23 percent of floorspace. EMCS controls HVAC in only 251,000 buildings or
6 percent of total number of buildings.

However, the DOE survey [Ex. 4&hyph;303] does not provide data by two-digit Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC). The number of buildings by SIC will determine subsequent costs. OSHA applied the DOE estimates of the number
of buildings by type of occupancy (single or multi-tenant) to the number of establishments by two-digit SIC given
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, OSHA allocated non-government single tenant buildings (estimated at 3.1
million) across the relative two-digit SIC using the relative two-digit SIC distribution of the number of establishments.
Then, OSHA allocated the 0.8 million non-government multi-establishment buildings across two-digit SIC using
the relative two-digit SIC distribution of the number of establishments in multi-establishment buildings (2.8
million). All government buildings were considered single tenant buildings. OSHA recognizes that this methodology
of classification of buildings by two-digit SIC code may not reflect the fact that establishments in multi-tenant
buildings should be allocated across several SICs or the fact that some single establishment buildings may be concentrated
in certain SICs instead of all SICs. This is particularly true for the agricultural sector for which farms and farm
buildings (silos, grain elevators and barns) are outside the scope of the IAQ portion of the proposal. However, OSHA
does not have the data to provide such delineation at this point. Table VI&hyph;2 presents OSHA's estimate of the number
of buildings by two-digit SIC and by characteristics of occupancy and ventilation system.

6. Buildings With Indoor Air Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Many published reports on building wellness describe buildings in terms of two general categories, sick or well buildings.
Some of the published categories, in addition to the terms sick or well are: problem buildings and non-problem buildings,
healthy buildings; buildings with high and low rates of IAQ related complaints; sick building syndrome (SBS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBS symptom complex is characterized by a range of symptoms including but not limited to, eye, nose and throat irritation,
dryness of mucous membranes and skin, nose bleeds, skin rash, mental fatigue, headache, cough, hoarseness, wheezing,
nausea and dizziness [Ex. 4&hyph;159]. Within a given building there will usually be some commonality among the symptoms
manifested as well as temporal association between occupancy in the building and appearance of symptoms. Many people
who work in buildings characterized as having SBS typically exhibit health symptoms that disappear when the person
is no longer in the building. In most cases, a physical basis for the occurrence of the SBS can be found: lack of proper
maintenance, changes in thermal or contaminant loads imposed during the building's life, changes in control strategies
to meet new objectives (e.g., energy conservation) or inadequate design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building-related illnesses (BRI), on the other hand, are medically diagnosed diseases that present symptoms that
can last for weeks, months, years or even a lifetime. Examples include nosocomial infections, humidifier fever,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and legionellois. BRI can develop as a result of poor building systems operation
and maintenance and uncontrolled point sources of contaminants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No building has a complete absence of problems, but those that function with minimal occupant complaints and comply
with acceptable criteria for occupant exposure, system performance, maintenance procedures and economic objectives
may be characterized as healthy buildings. Figure VI&hyph;1 below presents the classification of buildings by stages
of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information submitted to the docket, OSHA assumed that 30 percent of the buildings have indoor air quality
problems [Ex. 3&hyph;745].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The commercial building energy consumption survey estimates that there are 70.7 million employees. However, survey
data do not provide information by two-digit SIC. OSHA examined data obtained through the Bureau of Labor Statistics
to estimate the number of employees by two-digit SIC affected by the proposed standard. The data from the Bureau provided
occupational breakdown of the labor force by detailed industry categories (two-digit SIC) and major occupational
groupings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
OSHA classified employees according to whether or not they work primarily in indoor areas, e.g., areas with possible
exposures, by developing percentages of employees in each occupational category who might be working indoors. For
example, personnel in the transportation industries were apportioned according to those potentially exposed to
indoor air pollution (office workers) and those who are not (truck drivers). Table VI&hyph;3 presents the distribution
of the 70.7 million employees who work indoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No data are available as to the number of employees exposed to poor indoor air quality. Based on OSHA's percentage of
problem buildings (30 percent), OSHA assumed that 30 percent of employees working indoors are exposed to poor indoor
air quality. Therefore, the number of employees potentially affected is 21 million.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) represents one of the strongest sources of indoor air contaminants in buildings
where smoking is permitted. ETS is a mixture of irritating gases and carcinogenic tar particles and is considered
one of the most widespread and harmful indoor air pollutants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 State and Local Governments have adopted an increasing number of ordinances and regulations limiting smoking in
public and private worksites. The restrictiveness of these laws varies from simple, limited prohibitions to laws
that ban smoking. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in public workplaces and 19 states
and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in private workplaces.

There are 397 city and county smoking ordinances covering 22 percent of the total population [Ex. 4&hyph;305]. A total
of 297 cities and counties mandate the adoption of workplace smoking policies. Typically these provisions require
employers (private and public) to maintain a written smoking policy. Ordinances range from requirements for written
smoking policies to the total elimination of smoking in the workplace. A total of 505 cities and counties limit smoking,
specifically in restaurants. The requirements range from a nonsmoking section of unspecified size to the banning
of all smoking [Ex. 4&hyph;305].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 1991 survey of company smoking policies shows that of the 85 percent of firms with smoking policies, 34 percent have
complete bans and another 34 percent prohibit smoking in all open work areas. Over 90 percent of non-manufacturing
establishments have smoking policies [H&hyph;030 Ex. 77]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workplace smoking policies are more common in larger businesses. In a survey of personnel managers, 63 percent of
those with 1,000 or more employees reported having a smoking policy compared with 52 percent of companies with fewer
employees. In the same survey, smaller companies were half as likely as larger ones to have a policy under consideration.
Similar findings were reported by the National Survey of Worksite Health Promotion Activities, in which larger worksites
were more likely than smaller ones to report smoking control activities. In a survey of private New York city businesses,
only 4 percent of companies with fewer than 100 employees had a written smoking policy [Ex. 3&hyph;1030Q].

(b) Number of nonsmokers working indoors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the National Health Interview Survey, OSHA estimated that 74.2 million employees or 73.01 percent of the
U.S. labor force covered by OSHA are nonsmokers. Table VI&hyph;4 presents the distribution of nonsmoking employees
by two digit SIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of population based surveys show that 88 percent of nonsmokers are aware of the negative health consequences
of ETS. Despite this general awareness, exposure to ETS is pervasive [Ex. 4&hyph;98]. To determine the occupational
exposure of nonsmoking employees to ETS, OSHA used the estimate provided by the 1991 National Health Interview Survey.
The survey, requested information from employed individuals on whether during the past two weeks anyone smoked in
their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for non-response and weighted to reflect national estimates,
18.81 percent reported exposure to ETS. OSHA believes that the 18.8 percent is an underestimate since it is based solely
on self reported information and the question was not very specific in defining ``immediate'' work area. A recent
reanalysis of a study by Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;68] shows that 48.67 percent of currently employed nonsmokers
reported ETS exposure at work and not at home [Ex. 3&hyph;442F].

(1) Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;to assure
so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our
human resources.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor, when promulgating
occupational safety and health standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;that
most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will
suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' It is on the basis of this
congressional directive that OSHA has initiated regulatory actions to reduce the adverse health effects associated
with occupational exposure to indoor air pollutants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below assesses the requisite preconditions for optimal safety in the context of a free market economy,
and real world economic factors are compared with the free market paradigm to illustrate the shortcoming of the nonregulatory
environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
(2) Market Imperfections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatly reduced where private markets work efficiently
and effectively to allocate health and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitive labor
markets where employees, having perfect knowledge of job risks and being perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage
premiums that fully compensate for any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupational injury
and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for the hazardous workplace conditions and ultimately by
the consumers who pay for the final goods and services produced by these firms. With all costs internalized, private
employers have an incentive to reduce hazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the total cost to the
firm, the work force, and society of the expected injury or illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conditions of perfect competition do not need to be completely satisfied in order for the forces of the market to
approximate an efficient outcome. However, some market imperfections can produce sub-optimal results that can
be improved upon with regulatory action. In the case of this rulemaking, employees face a significant health risk
which is not adequately addressed by current nonregulatory alternatives. OSHA, therefore, believes that it must
take appropriate actions to provide greater health protection for workers exposed to toxic substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although OSHA believes that adequate job safety and health could exist in the private market under perfect conditions,
the private market often fails to provide acceptable levels of safety and health in instances where these conditions
are not met. It appears that at least two of several conditions traditionally considered essential components of
perfect markets are absent from the environment in which employees are exposed to hazards associated with exposure
to indoor pollutants: (1) Perfect employee knowledge of risks and (2) perfect employee mobility between jobs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests that in the absence of immediate or clear-cut
danger, employees and employers have little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-term
effects of exposure. Employers faced with potentially high compensatory payments may, in fact, have a disincentive
to provide information to employees. When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employees might
still find informed decisionmaking a difficult task, especially where long latency periods precede the development
of chronic disabling disease. Moreover, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness could be job-related
or could have other causes_employees and employers may not link disease with such occupational exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances,
many face limited employment options. Nontransferability of occupational skills and high national unemployment
rates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employment quickly or easily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is not between a safe job and a better paying but more
hazardous position, but simply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of pay and risk. In addition
to the fear of substantial income loss from prolonged periods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance
to break family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factors such as pension plans and seniority rights
serve to elevate the cost of job transfer. Thus, especially where wages are more responsive to the demands of more mobile
workers who tend to be younger and perhaps less aware of job risks, hazard premiums for the average worker will not be
fully compensated. Where this is the case, labor market negotiations are unlikely to reflect accurately the value
that workers place on health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these market imperfections, externalities occur if employers and employees settle for an inefficiently
low level of protection from hazardous substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workers
and their employers should be affected by the level of safety and health provided in market transactions. In the case
of occupational safety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationally induced
diseases, including the costs of premature death, chronic illness, and disability. Those individuals who suffer
from occupationally related illnesses are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer support of social
programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If private employers do not have to pay the full cost of production, they have no economic incentive to reduce hazards
whenever the cost of hazard abatement is greater than the cost of the expected illness. In this way, the private market
fails to produce optimal levels of safety.

(3) Alternative Non-regulatory Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Based on the above evidence, OSHA has concluded that the private market has failed to provide optimal levels of safety
to employees. Consequently, some form of intervention that fosters safer work environments must be used to reduce
occupational exposure. Because such intervention need not occur through government regulation, OSHA has considered
the effectiveness of other non-regulatory options: (1) relying on tort litigation and (2) relying on workers' compensation
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Tort Liability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of liability under tort law is one nonregulatory alternative that has been increasingly used in litigation
concerning occupationally related illnesses. Prosser [Ex. 4&hyph;256] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong,
other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for damages''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the tort system applies, it would allow a worker whose health has been adversely affected by occupational exposure
to a hazardous substance to sue and recover damages from the employer. Thus, if the tort system is effectively applied,
it might shift the liability of direct costs of occupational disease from the worker to the firm under certain specific
circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viable alternative in dealings between employees
and employers. All states have legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusive or principal
remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus, under tort law, workers with an occupational disease
caused by exposure to a hazardous substance can only file a product liability suit against a third party manufacturer,
processor, distributor, sales firm, or contractor. It is often difficult, however, to demonstrate a direct link
between an exposure to a hazardous substance and the illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to pursue litigation successfully, there must be specific knowledge of the magnitude and duration of a worker's
exposure to a hazardous substance, as well as the causal link between the disease and the occupational exposure. Usually,
it is extremely difficult to isolate the role of occupational exposures in causing the disease, especially if workers
are exposed to many toxic substances and the exposure is not necessarily limited to the workplace such as the case for
ETS. This difficulty is further compounded by the long latency periods that are frequently involved. In addition,
the liable party must be identifiable, but workers may have several employers over a working lifetime. The burden
of proof that an occupational exposure to a hazardous substance occurred, that a specific employer is the liable party,
and that the exposure level was significant may prohibit the individual from initiating the suit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an increasing number of lawsuits that are related to health effects to building occupants from poor indoor
air quality. These lawsuits are typically filed after the illness or health effect has been diagnosed. In this sense,
increasing pressure is being placed on businesses. However, the legal pressure currently does not relate to the implementation
of a clean indoor air policy (e.g., legal action is not currently being taken just because a company does not have a clean
indoor air policy. These actions are event related as opposed to being policy related). IAQ litigation is growing
rapidly and the focus is shifting from residential to commercial facilities. Examples to emphasize that are the recent
$12.5 million claims against the Social Security Administration for the Richmond, California episode of Legionnaire's
disease, the Call versus Prudential case in which building tenants settled with the defendants in what may have been
the first jury trial in sick building litigation, and a suit by Hamilton, Ohio, county employees against their office
building owners alleging exposure to fumes, bacteria, fungi, dust and irritants [Ex. 3&hyph;575].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legal proceedings do not internalize occupational illness costs because they involve substantial legal fees associated
with bringing about court action. In deciding whether to sue, the tort victim must be sure that the size of the claim
will be large enough to cover legal expenses. In effect, the plaintiff is likely to face substantial transaction costs
in the form of a contingency fee, commonly 33 percent, plus additional legal expenses. The accused firm must also pay
for its defense. The high costs and uncertainties associated with tort law make it an inefficient mechanism for ensuring
adequate protection of workers' health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insurance and liability costs are not borne in full by the specific employer responsible for the risk involved. For
firms that are insured, the premium determination process is such that premiums only partially reflect changes in
risk associated with changes in exposure to hazardous substances. This lack of complete adjustment is the so-called
``moral hazard'' problem, which is the risk that arises from the possible imprudence of the insured. As the insured
firm has paid an insurance company to assume some of the risks, that firm has less reason to exercise the diligence necessary
to avoid losses. Transfer of risk is a fundamental source of imperfection in markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a growing number of state and local laws and ordinances controlling smoking. Armed with new data that show
health effects from indoor air pollutants, plaintiffs who believe that they have been injured by the air inside their
workplaces are beginning to take the offensive. They are lobbying on the local, state and federal levels for protective
legislation, and in the absence of such legislation, they are suing for damages to their health. These cases are complex
not only in the nature of the technical proof that must be developed and presented, but also in the number of parties
involved. Suits have been filed against architects, builders, contractors, building product manufacturers and
realtors [Ex. 3&hyph;662].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Workers' Compensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Workers' Compensation system is a result of the perceived inadequacies in liability or insurance systems to compel
employers to prevent occupational disease or compensate workers fully for their losses. The system was designed
to internalize some of the social costs of production, but in reality it has fallen short of compensating workers adequately
for occupationally related disease. Thus, society shares the burden of occupationally related health effects,
premature mortality, excess morbidity, and disability through taxpayer support of social programs such as welfare,
Social Security disability payments, and Medicare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compensation tends to be inadequate especially in permanent disability cases, in view of the expiration of benefit
entitlement and the failure to adjust benefits for changes in a worker's expected earnings over time. As of January
1987, eight states restricted permanent disability benefits either by specifying a maximum number of weeks for which
benefits could be paid or by imposing a ceiling on dollar payments [Ex. 4&hyph;302].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, time and dollar restrictions on benefit payments are even more prevalent in the area of survivor benefits.
The duration of survivor benefits is often restricted to 10 years, and dollar maximums on survivor payments range
from $7,000 to $60,000. In addition, it should be noted that if the employee dies quickly from the occupational illness
and has no dependents, the employer need pay only nominal damages under Workers' Compensation (e.g., a $1,000 death
benefit).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in spite of current statutory protection, disability from occupational diseases represents a continuing,
complex problem for Workers' Compensation programs. Occupational diseases may take years to develop, and more than
one causal agent may be involved in their onset. Consequently, disabilities resulting from occupationally induced
illness often are less clearly defined than those from occupationally induced injury. As a result, Workers' Compensation
is often a weak remedy in the case of occupational disease. Indeed, there is some evidence indicating that the great
majority of occupationally induced illnesses are never reported or compensated [Ex. 4&hyph;84].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The insurance premiums paid by a firm under the Workers' Compensation system are generally not experience rated;
that is, they do not reflect the individual firm's job safety and health record. About 80 percent of all firms are ineligible
for experience rating because of their small size. Such firms are class rated, and rate reductions are granted only
if the experience of the entire class improves. Even when firms have an experience rating, the premiums paid may not
accurately reflect the true economic losses. Segregation of loss experience into classes is somewhat arbitrary,
and an individual firm may be classified with other firms that have substantially different normal accident rates.
An experience rating is generally based on the benefits paid to workers, not on the firm's safety record. Thus, employers
may have a greater incentive to reduce premiums by contesting claims than by initiating safety measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Workers' Compensation system suffers from several shortcomings that seriously reduce its effectiveness
in providing incentives for firms to create safe and healthful workplaces. The scheduled benefits are significantly
less than the actual losses to the injured workers, and recovery is often very difficult in the case of occupational
diseases. Thus, the existence of a Workers' Compensation system limits an employer's liability significantly below
the actual costs of the injury. In addition, premiums for individual firms are unlikely to be specifically related
to that firm's risk environment. The firm, therefore, does not receive the proper economic signals and consequently
fails to invest sufficient resources in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses. The economic costs not borne
by the employer are borne by the employee or, as is often the case, by society through public insurance and welfare programs.

(4) Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequately protect workers from the adverse health
effects associated with exposure to indoor air pollution. Tort liability laws and Workers' Compensation provide
some protection, but due to market imperfections they have not been sufficient. Some employers have not complied
voluntarily with standards recommended by professional organizations. The deleterious health effects resulting
from continued exposure to hazardous substances require a regulatory solution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Health effects typically caused by poor IAQ have been categorized as Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) or Building-Related
Illness (BRI). Some of the symptoms that characterize SBS include: irritation of eyes, nose and throat, dry mucous
membranes and skin and coughs, hoarseness of voice and wheezing, hypersensitivity reaction, nausea and dizziness.

BRI describes specific medical conditions of known etiology such as: Respiratory allergies, legionellosis, humidifier
fever, nosocomial infections, sensory irritation when caused by known agents and the symptoms and signs characteristic
of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, pesticides, endotoxins or
mycotoxins. BRIs do not disappear when the person leaves the building.

of workplace exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;33, 4&hyph;318]. However, specific data on the occurrence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-related cases due to workplace exposure were not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the reductions attributable to the proposed standard, such as decreases in the number of upper respiratory
symptoms (nose, throat and eye symptoms) and severe headaches have been estimated. Other reductions, however, have
not been quantified at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's estimates are based upon the exposure profile (presented in Table VI&hyph;5) and OSHA's quantitative risk
assessment discussed in detail in the preamble to the proposal). OSHA preliminarily estimates the risk of working
in mechanically ventilated workplaces to be 57 severe headaches and 85 upper respiratory symptoms per 1,000 employees
over a 45 year work lifetime. By applying these rates to the affected population at risk, OSHA estimates that 3.8 million
severe headaches and 5.6 million upper respiratory symptoms will develop in employees over the next 45 years who work
in buildings with mechanical ventilation (with the worker population held constant). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A common theme that runs through the literature and the OSHA docket indicates that the principal factor associated
with indoor air quality complaints is inadequate ventilation. However, information available does not quantify
the effectiveness of ventilation improvements. NEMI reports that: ``ventilation system modifications and improvements
are key elements of solving existing IAQ problems and reducing IAQ complaints. In every case where recommended ventilation
system modifications and improvements are implemented, the frequency and severity of complaints are reduced significantly''
[Ex. 3&hyph;1183]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the submissions base the effectiveness of ventilation improvements on the NIOSH analysis of indoor air quality
investigations [Exs. 3&hyph;1183, 3&hyph;1090]. In approximately 500 indoor air quality investigations, NIOSH
found that the primary causes of indoor air quality problems were inadequate ventilation (52%), contamination from
outside the building (10%), microbial contamination (5%), contamination from building fabric (4%), and unknown
sources (13%). Excluding contamination from building fabric and unknown sources, this suggests that 83 percent
of complaints related to IAQ problems would be eliminated by the proposed OSHA standard. For purposes of this analysis,
OSHA assumes that the overall effectiveness is, therefore, 80 percent. As shown in Table VI&hyph;5, OSHA estimates
that the proposed standard will prevent 3.0 million severe headaches and 4.5 million upper respiratory symptoms
over the next 45 years. This is, approximately, 69,000 severe headaches and 105,000 upper respiratory symptoms per
year. These estimates understate the prevalence of building-related symptoms since they only reflect excess risk
in only air conditioned buildings. OSHA believes that the standard will also prevent severe headaches and upper respiratory
symptoms in heated (but not air conditioned) buildings, and that it will prevent various other adverse health effects.
OSHA is seeking additional information upon which to base quantifiable estimates of the other known adverse health
effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests comment on the methodology of estimating the benefits for the IAQ portion of the proposal. Specifically,
OSHA requests any studies which document (in quantitative terms) the effectiveness of HVAC maintenance on the decline
of indoor air related ailments.

2. Environmental Tobacco Smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tobacco smoke has been classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the Surgeon
General, NIOSH, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The National Health Interview Survey of Cancer Epidemiology
and Control (NHIS-CEC) shows that the prevalence of cigarette smoking continues to decline in smoking among adults
by approximately 0.50 percent per year. Despite these declines, smoking is responsible for an estimated 390,000
deaths. Exposure to ETS has been associated with the occurrence of many diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease
in nonsmokers and low birthweight in the offspring of nonsmokers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
OSHA's estimates are based upon the exposure profile (presented in Table VI&hyph;3) and OSHA's quantitative risk
assessment (discussed in detail in the preamble to the proposal). The OSHA estimates of lifetime risk of death attributable
to exposure to ETS in the workplace range between 0.4 and 1 for lung cancer and between 7 and 16 for coronary heart disease,
per 1,000 exposed employees. OSHA's estimate of the attributable risks suggest that all baseline cases of lung cancer
and coronary heart disease will be prevented due to elimination of exposure of nonsmokers to ETS in the workplace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table VI&hyph;6 presents estimates of the incidence of work-related cases avoided of lung cancer and heart disease
following either the banning of smoking in the workplace or limiting smoking to designated smoking areas. OSHA estimates
that approximately between 5,583 and 32,502 cancer deaths and 97,700 to 577,818 coronary heart disease deaths related
to occupational exposure to ETS will be prevented over the next 45 years. This represents 140 to 722 cancer deaths per
year and 2,094 to 13,001 heart disease deaths per year.

OSHA has also preliminarily determined that the estimated number of deaths or illnesses prevented understates the
actual benefits that would occur under the proposed standard. Significant additional economic benefits, apart
from the lives saved and illnesses averted, are anticipated most of which can not be quantified at this time.

The major forms of these savings are efficiency and productivity improvements, cost reductions in operations and
maintenance, and reduced incidence of property damage.

(a) Worker Productivity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Productivity gains are realized when less labor input is required per unit of production. A productivity gain can,
therefore, take the form of either a decrease in the labor hours needed to maintain the level of production or in the
form of increased production and net income for the establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Productivity losses due to indoor air quality may take several forms: employees may be less effective because they
feel fatigued or suffer from headaches, eye irritation or other effects. Employees may accomplish less per hour worked
or may spend more time away from their work location (e.g., taking breaks or walks outdoor). One company indicated
that ``since two of my employees have refrained from smoking while working .&blank;.&blank;., their production
has increased and their overall health seems better to say nothing of the health of those working around them'' [Ex.
3&hyph;192]. In addition to individual productivity, the quality of indoor air affects organizational productivity
such as the visitor and customer satisfaction, impact on sales and revenue and repeat customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little data exist on productivity lost due to poor indoor air quality. A survey of 94 state government office buildings
attributes an average productivity loss of 14 minutes per day or 3.0 percent to poor indoor air quality [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H2].
Based on information gathered from published resources, the National Energy Management Institute estimates that
there is an increase in productivity of 3.5 percent or approximately 15 minutes per day for employees in a building
that starts as an unhealthy building, and after IAQ improvements, becomes a healthy building [Ex. 4&hyph;240]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To monetize the productivity improvements resulting from implementation of the proposed IAQ standard, OSHA multiplied
the average employee payroll by 3.0 percent. As shown in Table VI&hyph;7, monetized productivity improvements is
estimated at an annual $15 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 High concentrations of contaminants in indoor air can have adverse effects on materials and equipment. Damages may
include corrosion of electronic components and electrical current leakage, which may eventually result in equipment
malfunction. The costs of materials and equipment damage by indoor air pollutants include maintenance, repair,
and/or replacement costs resulting from (1) soiling or deterioration of a materials's appearance, or (2) reduced
service life for corroded or degraded appliances, furnishings, and equipment [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H2].

Bell Communications Research reported that the seven regional telephone companies have spent large sums ranging
from $10,000 to $380,000 per event to replace, clean and repair switches and other electronic equipment malfunctioning
as a result of indoor air contaminants.

Microbial contamination can cause significant damage to buildings and equipment and there is anecdotal evidence
that damage can be so severe as to make a building unfit for human occupation. OSHA requests comment on the explicit
or implicit rental value affected in buildings with such problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No quantitative estimates are available on the effects of indoor air on equipment. OSHA requests more information
on the effects of indoor air on materials and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indoor air pollutants and in particular ETS contribute to increased maintenance and cleaning expenses. Increased
maintenance and cleaning costs include: the need to paint walls more frequently, need to clean, repair and replace
furniture, upholstery, carpeting and curtains or drapes that have cigarette burns and or odors; the need to wash windows,
showcases, and other surfaces that attract ash and dust; and the need to clean ashtrays. A survey of 2,000 companies
that had adopted no-smoking policies found that 60 percent of these companies were able to reduce their cleaning and
maintenance costs. The savings have been estimated at about $500 per smoker per year (3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If establishments decide to ban smoking in the workplace, the proposed standard would result in virtually eliminating
all smoking related fires, fire fatalities and injuries and direct property damage. Smoking is a leading cause of
fire related fatalities. During the 1980's, the National Fire Protection Association reports that smoking materials
were the cause of over 200,000 fires per year. This resulted in more than 1,000 civilian fatalities and 3,000 civilian
injuries and approximately $300 million in direct property damage. During the period of 1989 to 1990, there was an
average of $115 million in direct property damage due to non-residential smoking related fires which resulted in
36 fatalities and 3,212 injuries. OSHA will further investigate this issue and requests available data from the public.

E. Technological Feasibility and Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This section presents OSHA's preliminary compliance cost estimates for the proposed standard on indoor air quality.
The cost analysis covers the major proposed provisions for which data are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests more information on the consideration for the relationship of employers and facility owners. The decision
to implement any IAQ improvements will be greatly influenced by the relationship between employers and landlords.
Since changes in building ventilation systems will be made by landlords, employers may have to negotiate agreements
to ensure that they can meet the OSHA standard. On the requirement for ETS, landlords in turn are likely to pressure
employers to ban smoking; thereby, forestalling any need for construction of designated smoking rooms. This section
also examines the technological feasibility of complying with proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Technological Feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As interpreted in the Benzene and Cotton Dust cases, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires that the
Agency, with regard to exposure to toxic substances, is to reduce significant risk of material health impairment
to the extent feasible. Accordingly, as part of the investigation of the potential effects of the OSHA proposal, OSHA
has examined both the technological and economic feasibility of the proposal. The economic feasibility assessment
appears later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's assessment of the technological feasibility is based on an examination of what would be required to comply
with the proposal, along with a review of existing practices among affected establishments. With regard to this proposal,
problems with technological feasibility, by and large, are not evident. Employers are required to operate their
HVAC systems within those parameters originally designated for the equipment. While many employers may choose to
provide separately ventilated smoking areas, this is an option, not a requirement, under the proposed regulation.
This technology is widespread currently and can be used to achieve compliance with the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in some situations, such as hotels and prisons, employees have as their workplace the residence of others
who live in that building. Restaurants, bars and other ``public'' places expose employees to customer's tobacco
smoke. While it is technologically feasible to ban smoking in those establishments, there may be other problems,
legal and economic. While it is theoretically possible to minimize employee exposure to ETS in such a work environment
through special ventilation, in the absence of modified customer service arrangements, actually eliminating worker
exposure to ETS would likely prove difficult. Consequently, the selection process for one of the smoking policy alternatives
for a particular workplace must consider both the physical limitations of the building or firm and the building's
use. In addition, some employers may be using their building facilities for purposes for which the original design
did not intend, and for which retrofitting might prove difficult. OSHA requests comment on those workplaces for which
compliance with the proposed standard would prove technologically challenging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA will consider additional information on the ability of firms to implement IAQ programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
OSHA estimated preliminary costs of complying with the proposed standard. OSHA's cost assumptions and methodologies
are based on information available from the rulemaking record. Further detailed industry analysis will be developed
by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table VI&hyph;8 contains OSHA's estimates of the annualized first-year and the annual recurring costs of full compliance
with the proposed rule. The annualized first-year cost of compliance is $1.4 billion. The cost for eliminating exposure
to ETS may range from $0 to $68 million depending on whether establishments shall ban smoking or allow smoking in designated
areas. OSHA estimated that the annual cost of compliance with the IAQ standard will be $8.1 billion, of which the most
costly provision will be for the building systems operation and maintenance, $8.0 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA developed cost estimates for the affected industries using the following categories of information: (1) Provisions
of the proposed standard requiring activities; (2) the number of potentially affected buildings, establishments
and employees; (3) the percentage of establishments or buildings in each industry currently in compliance with each
proposed requirement; and (4) the unit costs for bringing establishments into compliance with the various provisions
of the proposed standard. These four items were combined to produce OSHA's estimated costs of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs were estimated on an annual basis, with total annual costs calculated as the sum of annualized initial costs
and annual recurring costs. All capital costs and non-recurring first year costs were annualized over the service
life of the equipment or administrative activity, at a discount rate of 10 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and maintenance. The plan should provide an overview of the building and system, using a short text description and
single-line schematics or as-built construction documents. The operations information would also describe how
to operate the HVAC systems so that it performs with the reported design criteria. In addition, the operations information
should include: (1) Special procedures like seasonal start-ups and shutdowns, and (2) a list of operating performance
criteria such as minimum outside air ventilation rates, potable hot water storage and delivery temperatures, range
of space relative humidities and any space pressurization requirements, (3) an evaluation of the need to retrofit
the HVAC system when the design occupancy levels are exceeded, and (4) a checklist for visual inspection of building
systems.

The maintenance written plan will also include a description of the equipment to be maintained and the recommended
maintenance procedures and frequency of performance. Preferably, the plan should contain the equipment maintenance
manuals issued upon completion of facility construction. For establishments in buildings with natural ventilation,
employers will develop a plan to assure that windows, doors, vents, stacks and other portals designed or used for natural
ventilation are in operable condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost associated with compiling such information will vary depending on the size of the establishment building,
the complexity of the building system, the extent to which such information is already available, and type of occupancy
(e.g., single establishment or multi-establishment). In some cases some establishments especially the large ones
may already have developed such information. For example, in 1986, IBM initiated a program by first evaluating building
design, operation and maintenance and as a result, an IAQ program was devised to include: a model operation/maintenance
and IAQ awareness program for building operation/maintenance personnel, an updated building commissioning document
and appropriate building lease and contracted operation/maintenance agreements [Ex. 3&hyph;904]. There are no
data on the number of establishments with IAQ programs. Based on information in the docket, OSHA assumed that 95 percent
of all establishments are required to develop the IAQ compliance program information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, employers are required to: (1) identify a designated person who is given the responsibility of the IAQ
compliance program, (2) keep written records of employee complaints of building-related illness and maintenance
records, and (3) set up procedures to be utilized during renovation and modeling to minimize degradation of the indoor
air quality of employees performing such activities and employees in other areas of the building.

(b) IAQ Operation and Maintenance Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard requires maintenance and inspection of the building system components that directly affect
IAQ. Specifically, the HVAC system should provide at least the outside air ventilation rate based on actual occupancy,
building code, mechanical code or ventilation code and that carbon dioxide concentration does not exceed 800 parts
per million. In approximately 500 indoor air quality investigations, NIOSH found that the primary cause of indoor
air quality problems is inadequate ventilation (52 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other actions required include: (1) Control of humidity in buildings with mechanical cooling systems, (2) implementing
the use of general or local exhaust ventilation where maintenance and housekeeping activities involve use of equipment
or products which emit air contaminants in other areas of the facility, (3) maintain mechanical equipment rooms and
any non-ducted air plenums or chases in a clean condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that not every building will have to make all recommended changes to improve operation and maintenance
of the HVAC system. In the majority of the cases, some improvements can be accomplished by changing the setting on a
control device or centralized control system. Depending on the condition of the HVAC equipment, inspection and maintenance
may include simple housekeeping of equipment and air transport pathways and/or catastrophic failure maintenance
to repair/replace failed equipment. Also, there may be cases where a number of buildings will require major changes
in the HVAC system such as enlarging the size of the outside air intake.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cost for providing maintenance first requires an estimate of the number of buildings without regular HVAC maintenance.
The 1989 Commercial Buildings Characteristics survey by the Department of Energy estimates that 46 percent of the
buildings have regular HVAC maintenance. Therefore, the total number of buildings requiring maintenance is estimated
at 2.3 million. OSHA then determined the number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance by applying the OSHA
estimate of 30 percent (presented in section B). The number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance is estimated
at 0.7 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the average cost per year to maintain a commercial HVAC system is a function of a number of factors. These
factors include the type of system, the age of the system, the size of the system, layout of the system, reliability
of the equipment installed. In addition to the physical characteristics of the system, the cost per year to maintain
the system also depends on the operation of the system, the maintenance policies of the owner, the skill levels of the
operating engineers and maintenance workers, and whether the maintenance is carried out by employees of the building
owner or is the responsibility of an outside company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank of America's maintenance costs for its 2,000 worksites averaged $4 million per year or an average of $2,000 per
worksite [Ex. 3&hyph;552]. One facility, a high-rise office building, reported an annual cost of approximately
$0.6 million [Ex. 3&hyph;448]. DOW Chemical Company's estimate for ventilation systems maintenance ranges from
$0.17 to $0.25/sq.ft/yr [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. Therefore, OSHA used an average of $0.21/sq.ft/yr to compute the cost
of HVAC maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to regular HVAC maintenance, buildings with known IAQ problems will require other improvements such
as (1) relocating air intakes and other pathways of building entry to restrict the entry of outdoor air contaminants,
or (2) installing local source capture exhaust ventilation or substitution within workspaces where air contaminants
are being emitted, or (3) increasing ventilation effectiveness, or (4) reduce unwanted infiltration, or (5) monitor
outside air quantity to meet ventilation requirements. The National Energy Management Institute developed a cost
model for implementing IAQ improvements which is based on the distribution of buildings with IAQ problems by climate
zone, building activity and size, and characteristics of ventilation systems. The average cost to implement the
actions listed above are estimated to be $1.14 per square foot. These improvements will only be required for the initial
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost equation for implementing the compliance program is as follows:

Non-recurring first year costs were annualized over 20 years at 10 percent interest rate. As presented in Table VI&hyph;10,
the annualized first-year cost is estimated at $1.3 billion. OSHA anticipates total annual costs of $8.0 billion.

(c) Training for HVAC Maintenance Workers and Informing Employees About the Indoor Air Quality Standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standard requires training for all building maintenance workers involved in building system operation
and maintenance. Standards of maintenance vary dramatically in the HVAC industry and sometimes are deficient where
untrained personnel are designated to maintain very complex systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training programs for workers must include at least information on: (1) How to maintain adequate ventilation of air
contaminants generated during building cleaning and maintenance, and (2) how to minimize adverse effects on indoor
air quality during the use and disposal of chemicals and other agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exact cost of training will vary among establishments depending on whether employees are trained in-house or
sent to outside training programs or consultants. OSHA estimated the costs for the trainer who must research, prepare
and direct the sessions. For the time involved in the training session, a range of costs for the instructor could be
developed. For example, the wage costs for the trainer could represent from 50 percent of the trainee labor costs (if
there are only two in the class) to 5 percent if there are 20 trainees in a class. For the preparation time, OSHA judged
that the trainer will require a special study seminar, such as that taught by the Building Owners and Managers Association
International.

The total cost of training is estimated at $6.84 per maintenance worker for a half hour program. Table VI&hyph;11,
presents OSHA's estimate for the number of maintenance workers needing training and the associated costs. The annualized
first year cost is estimated at $0.5 million. It was assumed that job changes within establishments or buildings will
require retraining. The annual new hire cost is estimated at $0.8 million, based upon industry turnover rates. Thus
OSHA estimated annualized cost training to be $1.3 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard requires employers to inform all employees of the contents of the standard and its appendices.
This could be accomplished by posting the proposed standard at a bulletin board; therefore, OSHA did not include a
cost for this provision.

(d) Compliance with Related Standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standard requires employees performing work on HVAC systems to comply with several existing OSHA standards
and therefore any costs associated with compliance with this provision have already been considered. This requirement
is necessary to protect employees from exposure to indoor air pollutants and exposure to noise. This provision is
considered to have a de minimus effect on all industries and OSHA believes that establishments are in full compliance
with this requirement.

(e) Air Contaminant-Environmental Tobacco Smoke.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The primary objective of the tobacco smoke provision is to eliminate the nonsmoker's exposure to ETS. Under the proposed
rule, firms will have the option of either banning smoking of tobacco products or permitting smoking only in designated
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that not all establishments will make available designated smoking areas as there may be physical
constraints on the option of providing separate ventilation. Such constraints are imposed by the building's design,
the building's mechanical ventilation system's capabilities, by costs involved in providing adequate ventilation,
by the occupant use of the building. In some cases, establishments located in severe climate zones may find it necessary
to protect their smoking employees from weather exposure by providing designated smoking areas.

Establishments in large high rise buildings may also find it desirable to provide such rooms to facilitate break periods.
Consequently, in order to reflect the degree to which establishments will provide separate smoking areas, OSHA developed
some estimates based on the characteristics of the stock of buildings and the percentage of companies currently banning
smoking in the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has no data on the number of establishments currently permitting smoking in designated smoking areas. OSHA estimated
that 50 percent of large establishments with floor space greater than 100,000 square feet and with more than three
floors will provide designated smoking areas. OSHA also assumed that 50 percent of all eating and drinking places
and hotels and other lodging places may provide separate designated smoking areas. For these establishments, OSHA
then applied the percentage of companies that will ban smoking based on the rates provided from a survey conducted
by the Administrative Management Society Foundation (AMS) on current practices for smoking policies in the workplace.
According to the survey, 25 percent of the companies completely ban smoking on their premises. However, the percentages
varied by SIC as follows: manufacturing (23%), transportation and utilities (36%), banking and finance (28%), insurance
(38%), retail and wholesale (7%), and services (18%). Also, 72 percent felt that smoking in the workplace should be
either banned or restricted [H&hyph;030_Ex. 75]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firms opting to make available designated smoking areas are expected to incur initial capital costs. OSHA assumed
that in many cases existing rooms or offices can be converted into a designated smoking area. Average cost estimates
for retrofitting the HVAC system ranges from $4,000 for a 150 square feet room (which could accommodate up to 10 smokers)
[Ex. 4&hyph;265] to $25,000 for 1,000 square feet (which could accommodate 30 to 65 smokers) [Ex. 3&hyph;643]. The
HVAC retrofit represented in these estimates typically includes: (1) blocking off the return air inlet from the room,
(2) providing a transfer air path, and (3) providing an exhaust fan and exhaust air pathway to the outside. The exhaust
fan capacity would exceed air supplied to the room in sufficient quantity to create a negative pressure in the smoking
room relative to surrounding areas to ensure containment of the contaminant. In order to achieve negative pressure
some architectural modifications may be necessary to provide a tight enclosure. OSHA did not estimate an additional
cost for housekeeping since such activities would have been performed prior to the promulgation of the proposed standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most facilities exhaust air from toilet rooms and also relieve air brought in for ventilation and economizer cooling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10(a)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The amount of exhaust air from a designated smoking area is inconsequential compared with the quantities of air leaving
the building through toilet room exhaust and relief. Therefore, OSHA did not include recurring cost for the provision
of a separately ventilated smoking area.

(f) Air Quality during Renovation and Remodeling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard requires that during renovation and remodeling appropriate controls are utilized to minimize
degradation of the indoor air quality of employees performing such activities and employees in other areas of the
building. The basic characteristics of available control practices include: ventilation system/high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) vacuum; regulated areas, isolation or containment of work areas and appropriate negative
pressure containment; outside air intakes, return/recirculation air streams or plenums; notification of employees
and contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For buildings with asbestos presence, the control practices under the OSHA asbestos standard are current industry
practice. A survey developed for obtaining information on practices to control exposure to asbestos in buildings
shows that asbestos-related work represents 16 percent of renovation activities whereas general remodeling is
61 percent and major repair and maintenance are 12 percent [Ex. 4&hyph;64].

More than half of the buildings sampled were occupied during renovation activities. However, all projects in which
asbestos-related work was being performed were sealed off from the building occupants. A variety of renovation projects
were performed in buildings ranging in project area from 15 to 900,000 square feet, in duration from one to 156 weeks
and in cost from $700 to more than $10 million. The average cost was approximately $0.3 million and the average duration
for a project was 13 weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, no data are available on the cost to provide controls required under the proposed IAQ standard or for current
industry compliance for chemical exposure other than exposure to asbestos. OSHA assumed minimal cost due to the nature
of these processes.

F. Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The previous section presented the costs to all industries of complying with the proposed standard. This chapter
examines projected economic and environmental impacts on those industries. OSHA developed quantitative estimates
of the economic impact of the proposed standard on the affected industries. Data on profits are presented to illustrate
the scale of profitability of affected industries and do not necessarily represent their ability to pay for proposed
standard provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA assessed the potential economic impacts and has preliminarily determined that the standard is economically
feasible for each of the major industry groups that will be affected. OSHA conducted its analysis at the two digit SIC
level. This has been OSHA's procedure for doing regulatory impact analyses for other proposed standards. OSHA preliminarily
concludes that this is reflective of the actual impact on the average firm within each subsector. It does not appear
that the affected groups will experience significant adverse economic impact as a result of the standard. However,
if any interested person has information to show that the analysis at the two digit level is not representative of the
potential economic impact of the proposal, OSHA requests the following information: Reasons why the preliminary
regulatory analysis is not reflective of the actual anticipated costs in any particular sector; specific information
as to why the analysis at the two digit level fails to adequately represent the economic impact; and specific information
to help OSHA to better predict the impact on the sector in question. Such information should be included in the comments
on the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, OSHA additionally examined the potential for an unduly
burdensome impact on small entities. OSHA believes that the standard will not have significant adverse effect on
a substantial number of small entities. However, OSHA requests comment on those workplaces for which compliance
with the proposed standard would prove economically and technologically challenging (e.g., restaurants, bars
and other ``public'' places where employees are exposed to customer's tobacco smoke). While it is technologically
feasible to ban smoking in those establishments, there may be other countervailing problems, legal and economic,
which OSHA should consider.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In order to determine the economic feasibility of the rule, OSHA compared estimated compliance costs with: (1) The
value of sales and (2) before-tax profits. All financial data developed for this analysis are based on information
from Dun and Bradstreet's annual credit survey. Aggregate sales data for 1991 were taken from the D&amp;B Market Identifiers
data base [Exs. 4&hyph;94, 4&hyph;95, 4&hyph;96]. Mean profit rates (profit as a percentage of sales) were taken
from D&amp;B's Insight data base; OSHA averaged data for 1990, 1991 and 1992.

Using a conversion formula
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 based on the federal corporate tax schedule, OSHA calculated pre-tax profits from its estimate for post-tax profits.
It should be noted that the sales and profit data, while the most recent available, reflect conditions during a cyclical
trough; therefore, impacts may depict a worst case scenario. In the case of the federal government sector, price increases
for services rendered may not apply. Budgets are usually fixed (in the short run) and compliance costs are paid by reducing
funds for other items in the budget.

This conversion implicitly assumes individual business establishments are separate corporations. Because more
than one establishment may be grouped together for tax purposes, the conversion will tend to underestimate pre-tax
profits. State, local and other business taxes have not been factored into the conversion formula. Additionally,
because average tax rates may decline as pre-tax profits decline, the after-tax impact to the company may be less than
suggested here.

Where industry enjoys an inelastic demand for its product, an increase in operating costs can ordinarily be passed
on to consumers. In this case, the maximum expected price increase is calculated by dividing the estimated compliance
cost for each industry by the sales for that industry. Table VI&hyph;13 shows that the average price increase related
to the cost of this proposed standard would be extremely small, 0.07 percent, with the largest being 0.41 percent (Personal
Services, SIC&hyph;72). The results in Table VI&hyph;13 indicate that even if all costs were passed on to consumers
through price increases, the rule would have a negligible impact on prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many industries, however, establishments will not be able to pass along the entire cost of compliance through price
increases since consumers may respond by reducing demand. Such establishments will have to absorb from profit the
costs they cannot pass through. If all costs were absorbed from profit, the maximum expected decrease in profit can
be calculated by dividing the estimated compliance cost for each industry by its estimated profit. Table VI&hyph;13
shows that the average decline in profits under this worst-case-elasticity assumption would be less than 0.94 percent.
The largest potential decline in profits would be in Fishing at 4.5 percent (SIC&hyph;9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because most establishments will not find it necessary to absorb all of the costs from profits and will be able to pass
some of the costs on to consumers, average profits will not decline to the extent calculated in this analysis.

OSHA believes that these impacts are not large enough to impair economic viability. While some marginal firms might
be more seriously impacted, extensive economic dislocation is not expected to occur in any industry. OSHA has, therefore,
preliminarily determined that the standard is economically feasible.

(2) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed IAQ standard will affect numerous small establishments and a portion of these establishments may have
difficulty financing the compliance actions needed to comply depending on which alternative they choose. This section
examines the potential for exceptional impacts among small establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of compliance action limits the potential for exceptionally large compliance burdens on small businesses
because most costs will be incurred on a per employee or per square foot basis. The number of buildings occupied with
establishments with fewer than 20 employees is estimated at 3.7 million or 82 percent of all buildings. Of these, 76
percent have floor space less than 10,000 square feet. Thus, small firms will incur low costs because they have small
floorspace and few employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this point of the analysis, OSHA has not distributed the number of buildings across establishments since there
are no data on which to describe the establishments in multi-tenant buildings. Therefore, OSHA developed establishment
specific compliance costs based on the estimates presented in section E of this report. The economic impact by firm
size is estimated with the assumption that all establishments will require HVAC maintenance. It was assumed that
each establishment has a floor space of 10,000 square feet. To examine the potential regulatory burden that would
be experienced by small establishments, OSHA calculated the ratio of their annual compliance cost to their sales
and pre-tax profit for two scenarios for dealing with ETS: (1) provide designated smoking areas, or (2) totally ban
smoking in the workplace. As shown in Table VI&hyph;14, for both scenarios, the average ratio of compliance costs
to sales ranges from 0.44 percent to 0.52 percent. The highest impact (2.79 percent) for establishments not banning
smoking would be in Personal Services (SIC&hyph;72). Estimates of compliance cost as a percentage of pre-tax profits
were less than 7.05 percent for most sectors; Social Services establishments (SIC&hyph;83) would experience the
largest reduction in profit (31 percent), if they allow smoking in designated rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates apply to the average firm in each sector. The degree to which affected firms will either incur or shift
compliance costs depends largely on the competitive environment in which the establishments operate and on the elasticity
of demand for the establishment's services and commodities. OSHA requests information regarding compliance costs
against indicators of the demand for and the costs of the types of services and commodities provided by establishments
which would be affected by the proposed standard. OSHA specifically requests comments, including empirical data
regarding the demand elasticity of such establishments' patrons who will not be permitted to smoke in the presence
of employees at such establishments. If economic feasibility is shown to be an issue for establishments such as bars
and restaurants, what methods of compliance would adequately protect workers in a feasible manner?

The provisions of the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 432, et seq.], the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations [40
CFR Part 1500], and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures [29 CFR Part 11]. As a result of this review, OSHA concluded that this
rule will have no significant environmental impact.

VII. Summary and Explanation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements set forth in this notice are those which, based on currently available data, OSHA believes are necessary
and appropriate to control conditions which may degrade indoor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air and pose a significant risk of material impairment to employees in their work environments. The Agency considers
that a broad approach to the control of IAQ problems, as proposed in this notice, will most effectively lead to a reduction
in associated risk to employees [Exs. 3&hyph;2, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;37, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;239, 3&hyph;287, 3&hyph;434,
3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502]. OSHA has considered all data submitted in response to the Request for Information, as well
as other scientific data which has been made a part of the record in this proceeding in arriving at these proposed provisions
regarding regulation of indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections provide a summary of each provision of the proposal and a statement of their intent and purpose.
Exhibit numbers included in this Summary and Explanation are citations to supporting comments and data submitted
to the record in response to the RFI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits data, views, and comments on all provisions proposed in this notice. OSHA is interested in whether
or not the proposed provisions are necessary, appropriate, and adequate to achieve the goals of the standard and why.
Interested persons should also comment on whether or not the proposed provisions are technologically and economically
feasible and why, and whether additional or alternative provisions addressing indoor air quality should be included
in the standard and why.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope and Application: Paragraph (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is proposing that these standards cover all employees under its jurisdiction, including employees in general
industry, shipyards, longshoring, marine terminals, construction, and agriculture. To accomplish this, OSHA
is proposing to publish an identical complete standard for general industry at 29 CFR 1910.1033, for shipyards at
29 CFR 1915.1033, and for construction at 29 CFR 1926.1133. OSHA is proposing to amend section 1910.19 to make it clear
that &sect;1910.1033 is a Subpart Z standard which is incorporated by cross reference into 29 CFR parts 1917 and 1018
for longshoring and marine terminals. OSHA is proposing to amend 29 CFR 1928.21 to indicate that 1910.1033 will be
applicable to agriculture. OSHA requests comments on the scope of the proposal and the formal manner by which the standard
would be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) proposes to apply all provisions of the standard to ``nonindustrial work environments.'' In addition,
paragraph (a)(2) proposes to further extend coverage of the provisions found in paragraph (e)(1), which address
exposure to tobacco smoke, to all indoor work environments under OSHA's jurisdiction. This includes indoor work
areas on construction sites, shipyards, and agricultural employments. The Agency believes that application of
the proposed provisions under paragraph (e)(1) addressing exposure to tobacco smoke is necessary, appropriate,
and feasible for any indoor or enclosed workplace covered by OSHA. Compliance with the tobacco smoke provisions essentially
entails establishment of a separate enclosure, exhausted directly to the outside, and maintained under negative
pressure where smoking is permitted. OSHA sees no feasibility obstacles in application of these provisions to industrial
as well as nonindustrial work environments. It is not clear to OSHA, however, that the other indoor air quality provisions
of the proposed standard can be feasibly or appropriately applied in typical industrial work environments. These
provisions primarily address means to assure effective functioning of HVAC systems and actions felt necessary to
be taken to maintain good general indoor air quality. Thus, it may not be feasible or appropriate to apply these provisions
to industrial ventilation systems or industrial environments in which control of various industrial contaminant
emissions rather than general air quality is the primary issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definitions: Paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms are defined for the purpose of this proposal: ``Air Contaminants'', ``Assistant Secretary'',
``Building systems'', ``Building-related illness'', ``Designated person'', ``Designated smoking area'', ``Director'',
``Employer'', ``HVAC system'', ``Non-industrial work environment'', and ``Renovation and remodeling''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Air contaminants'' refers to substances contained in the vapors from paint, cleaning chemicals, pesticides,
solvents, particulates, outdoor air pollutants and other airborne substances which may cause material impairment
to the health of employees working within the nonindustrial environment. The term ``air contaminants'' informs
the employer that the provisions addressing control of air contaminants apply to airborne substances which may be
within nonindustrial indoor work environments. For purposes of this proposal the definition of air contaminants
may be broader than that used in 29 CFR 1910.1000. Hazardous levels of air contaminants may arise from contaminant
buildup due to inefficient or insufficient general dilution ventilation with outside air, the misapplication of
general dilution ventilation to address strong point sources, indoor activities or operations such as renovation,
remodeling, maintenance, etc. which lead to local source emissions, and entry of outdoor contaminants such as vehicle
exhausts, wastes, stored materials, or pollutants from adjacent industrial facilities. Provisions are proposed
in the standard which require the employer to take measures to address the avenues of contaminant buildup noted above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.
Department of Labor, or designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Building systems'' applies to the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, the potable
water system, the energy management system, and all other systems in a facility which may impact indoor air quality.
This broad definition was necessary to avoid excluding non-HVAC systems which do impact indoor air quality. In the
facilities industry, potable hot water systems are typically considered plumbing systems and not HVAC systems.
Plumbing systems (potable hot water) have been implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
episodes where the water is aerosolized, so excluding plumbing systems from the scope of this standard would have
been unacceptable. This definition also intends to focus operation and maintenance efforts on those systems whose
failure, degradation, or misuse would adversely impact indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Building-related illness'' describes specific medical conditions of known etiology which can be documented
by physical signs and laboratory findings. Such illnesses include sensory irritations when caused by known agents,
respiratory allergies, nosocomial infections, asthma, humidifier fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Legionnaires'
disease, and the symptoms and signs characteristic of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon
monoxide, formaldehyde, chlordane, endotoxins, or mycotoxins. ``Building-related illness'' defines the medical
conditions that, if observed, require evaluation of the facility building systems to determine if they are functioning
properly, and the taking of remedial action where warranted. Building-related illnesses are often potentially
severe and are often traceable to a specific contaminant source such as ETS, microbial growth, and a host of other chemical
or biologic substances which must be attended to mitigate degradation of indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Designated person'' means a person who has been given the responsibility by the employer to take necessary
measures to assure compliance with this section and who is knowledgeable in the requirements of this standard and
the specific HVAC system servicing the affected building or office. As noted above a ``Designated person'' must be
knowledgeable in HVAC system functioning. Provisions in the standard propose to require the ``Designated person''
to oversee the establishment and implementation of the IAQ compliance program, and oversee building systems inspection
and maintenance activities, thus this person must have technical expertise in those areas. OSHA believes that there
is a need for central responsibility in affected buildings and facilities [Exs. 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444b, 3&hyph;507].
Of course OSHA recognizes that in certain circumstances the ``Designated person'' may merely supervise or coordinate
the activities of outside contractors or shift-workers who have responsibility for maintaining parts of the building
systems. Building systems and other factors affecting indoor air quality are sufficiently complex and unique to
suggest the necessity of appointing a designated person who is on site to act on the employers behalf in this regard.
For example, multiple employers may be engaging in different activities within a facility that affect building system
functioning or air quality and actions by one employer may subject employees of other employers to environmental
hazards. Fragmentation of responsibility and lack of communication has been observed by OSHA in the nonindustrial
workplace. For example, when responding to an indoor air quality/building-related illness complaint, the OSHA
Compliance Officer may need to gather information from a number of responsible facility groups like tenant leasing,
facilities engineering, housekeeping, maintenance, operations, and energy management. These diverse groups
may have little or no central authority and direction especially if they are outside contractors. The designated
person would be in a position to mitigate the consequences of such diversity by being aware and responsible for the
overall environmental conditions in the building or facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other OSHA health standards have adopted similar requirements with respect to those proposed in this Notice regarding
the designated person. For example, final standards for chromium (57 FR 42102) and lead (58 FR 26590) require that
a technically knowledgeable ``competent person'' be on site during construction activities, which often involve
multiple employers. OSHA concluded in those standards that designating a person to act on the employers' behalf to
ensure compliance with various provisions of those standards, was necessary because of the need for continual site
characterization and analysis to identify the hazards present and the types of control measures and remedial actions
that are effective. For these same reasons, OSHA proposes requirements for designated persons under this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Designated smoking area'' means a room in which smoking of tobacco products is permitted. The Agency believes
that establishment of ``designated smoking areas'' is necessary to prevent employee exposure to ETS in workplaces
where smoking is not prohibited. Provisions are included in this proposal addressing design, construction and operation
of such areas to meet this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Director'' means the Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, or designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Employer'' means all persons defined as employers by section 3(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 including employers (such as building owners or lessees) who control the ventilation or maintenance of
premises where employees of other employers work. For purposes of the proposal, an employer is also defined as a person
who exercises control over the ventilation systems in the workplace. Control over the ventilation systems is a multi-faceted
concept: it includes maintenance, recordkeeping and the development and implementation of the indoor air quality
compliance plan. While responsibility for various aspects of the ventilation system encompasses many duties, the
proposal does not necessarily contemplate that all of the duties will be performed by the same person. The proposal
is flexible in that regard and responsibility for the various aspects can be shared by various persons depending on
the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many instances the employer will either be the owner of the building where the workplace is located or will be a long
term lessee, responsible under the lease for the care and maintenance of the property. In these cases, the owner/employer
would take care of the ventilation system by designating knowledgeable persons within his employ to the necessary
tasks or by hiring competent contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other cases, there will be a number of different businesses all located in separate leased space within the same
building. In these instances the various employer/lessees would probably share responsibility for compliance
with the proposed standard. For example, each individual lessee might be obligated to provide the building owner
with a description of the work activity planned for within its particular leased space, including the number of employees
or visitors expected, the hours of work operation and any situations where air contaminants may be released into the
workplace air. Air contaminants might reasonably be expected to be released into the workplace air as a result of the
installation of new furniture or wall coverings, any painting or remodeling scheduled to take place or any pest extermination
activity within the premises. Each employer would, of course, be responsible for reporting to whoever is in charge
of the ventilation system, any employee complaints or signs or symptoms that may be related to building-related illness.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The building owners or whoever is in charge of the maintenance of the ventilation system would be in a position to develop
standard operating procedures for the building systems as well as special procedures for emergencies and maintenance.
In addition such a person would be in a position to know or develop an appropriate maintenance schedule and to gather
relevant documents to assist in the care and maintenance of the ventilation system, such as diagrams of the system,
manufacturers manuals, and inspection guidelines and schedules for the proper maintenance of such systems. The
same person might also be responsible for maintaining and operating the HVAC system to provide the required air ventilation
rate and desired relative humidity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal is designed in this performance oriented manner to afford affected employers the flexibility to assure
the establishment and maintenance of a system to provide healthful indoor air quality in the most sensible and efficient
way possible considering their particular circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Act gives the Secretary the right to promulgate standards to assure employees
safe and healthful working conditions. Employers must comply with the standards which the Secretary promulgates.
The Act defines an employer expansively as a person with employees in a business affecting interstate commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the proposal as written will protect employees from the risks of poor indoor air quality.
Where the owner of a business is not the owner of the space where such business operates, the owner or landlord of the
building will probably also be an employer within the meaning of the Act and the definition contained in this proposal.
This is so because the building owner or operator will generally have employees (either on site or off site) and will
be engaged in a business affecting interstate commerce. In such cases the situation will be construed to be a multi-employer
worksite. Such situations are quite common in the context of construction sites. The Agency does not believe that
there is any reason to treat nonindustrial multi-employer worksites differently from construction multi-employer
worksites for purposes of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has a long history of enforcing OSHA standards in multi-employer worksites. Nothing in this proposed rule would
change the position that the Agency has taken in cases such as Anning-Johnson (4 OSH Cas. (BNA) 1193, Harvey Workover,
Inc., 7 OSH Cas. (BNA) 1687 and in its Field Operations Manual (CPL 2.45 CH&hyph;1, Chapter V&hyph;9). As a general
matter each employer is responsible for the health and safety of his/her own employees. However, under certain circumstances
an employer may be cited for endangering the safety or health of another employer's employees. In determining who
to hold responsible, OSHA will look at who created the hazard, who controlled the hazard, and whether all reasonable
means were taken to deal with the hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is contemplated that in those cases where there is a multi-employer worksite that the affected employers will divide
up the responsibilities in the manner in which they make the most sense. Those who have information at their disposal
that is required to be kept under the proposal will make use of the information or make it available to whoever will need
that information in the discharge of their duties. For example, the building engineer may have possession of the schematics
of the ventilation system. The engineer would make them available to the person responsible for maintaining the system
as well as the person responsible for developing the IAQ Compliance Plan (if that is not the same person). The proposal
is designed to promote the efficient resolution of indoor air quality problems and will not result in duplicative
efforts. There is nothing in the proposal, for example, that would prevent the building owner (who is an employer within
the meaning of the Act) from gathering the required information from the various lessee/employers in the premises,
developing, and implementing an IAQ Compliance Plan which would be shared with the various employers occupying the
premises. In addition, it may be more efficient for the building owner to develop and maintain the records required
by the proposal, again sharing them with the various employer-tenants. The Agency believes that the co-operative
interrelationships which the performance oriented proposal permits will avoid duplication of compliance activities
even within multi-employer worksites.

The term ``HVAC system'' means the collective components of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system
including, but not limited to, filters and frames, cooling coil condensate drip pans and drainage piping, outside
air dampers and actuators, humidifiers, air distribution ductwork, automatic temperature controls, and cooling
towers. This definition also intends to focus on those HVAC system components whose failure, degradation, or misuse
would adversely impact indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Nonindustrial work environment'' means an indoor or enclosed work space such as, but not limited to, offices,
educational facilities, commercial establishments, and healthcare facilities, and office areas, cafeterias,
and break rooms located in manufacturing or production facilities. Nonindustrial work environments do not include
manufacturing and production facilities, residences, vehicles, and agricultural operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Renovation and remodeling'' means building modification involving activities that include but are not
limited to: removal or replacement of walls, ceilings, floors, carpet, and components such as moldings, cabinets,
doors, and windows; painting, decorating, demolition, surface refinishing, and removal or cleaning of ventilation
ducts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``HVAC system'', ``Nonindustrial work environment'', and ``Renovation and remodeling'' are defined
to clarify and illustrate the parameters under which obligations of the standard are incurred. For example, the definition
of ``HVAC system'' lists what OSHA believes to be typical components of such systems which directly affect indoor
air quality. These components are enumerated since provisions under the standard propose to require employers to
perform routine inspection and maintenance on those components. ``Renovation and remodeling'' is defined to inform
the employer of the situations under which the standard proposes to require the employer to take special precautions
when those activities take place.

Indoor Air Quality Compliance Program: Paragraph (c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph proposes to require employers to obtain or develop certain written information that will facilitate
implementation of measures necessary to prevent degradation of indoor air quality. Paragraph (c)(2) proposes to
require the employer to identify a designated person to be given the responsibility of overseeing establishment
and implementation of the written compliance program. Paragraph (c)(3) proposes to require the employer to establish
a written IAQ compliance program to include at least the following information: a description of the facility building
systems; schematics or construction documents locating building systems equipment; information on the daily operation
and management of the building systems; a description of the building and its function; a written maintenance program;
and a checklist for visual inspection of the building systems. Further, paragraph (c)(4) proposes to require that
the following information also must be retained, if available, to assist in indoor air quality evaluations: as built
construction documents; HVAC system commissioning reports; HVAC system testing, adjusting and balancing reports;
operation and maintenance manuals; water treatment logs; and operator training materials. Paragraph (c)(5) proposes
to require the establishment of records of employee complaints of building-related illnesses, as part of the written
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that written plans are an essential element of an overall compliance program since it will encourage
employers to focus on indoor air quality and implement the necessary controls and measures to achieve compliance
with the standard [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;529].
The development of documented safety and health programs and procedures is a well-established and common practice
in industry, and requirements for written programs are typically found in other OSHA standards dealing with exposure
to toxic substances. Written plans provide information to allow OSHA, the employer, and employees to examine the
control methods chosen and evaluate the extent to which these planned controls are being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3) proposes to require the employer to establish written plans for compliance. Specifically, paragraphs
(c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(3)(iii) propose to require general, descriptive information about: the facility,
building systems, building function and building use patterns. This general building description is believed to
be essential information of a building profile which is necessary for a basic understanding of the building systems
and which is necessary to set the foundation for the operations and maintenance information required in other paragraphs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, in paragraph (c)(3)(iv), OSHA believes that it is necessary to require written information which describes
daily operation and management of the facility building systems which directly affects IAQ. When it comes to operations
and management, organizational fragmentation within nonindustrial buildings may be further exacerbated by the
lack of familiarity with the intent of the original design team whose assumptions and design intent for the HVAC system,
are typically unknown. Over time, building use may differ from original design intent in ways not foreseen by the original
designers. It is not uncommon for spaces to be loaded or used in ways beyond the original design intent which may adversely
impact IAQ, such as putting up walls for private offices, exceeding intended occupant densities, and bringing into
the space new contaminant sources. HVAC system total capacity may be able to handle these changes from original design
loads but little is done to balance the available capacity among the individual zones that may be overused or underused.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the employer may need to communicate design intent and performance criteria to building occupants whose
expectations regarding their environment may exceed what is deliverable by the building systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these issues, OSHA is proposing to require that each facility have written operations and management information
whose aim is twofold. One purpose is to collect, summarize and translate design assumptions and intent into operating
performance criteria that impact IAQ, such as minimum outside air ventilation rates and occupant densities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, the operations information should describe how to operate and manage the building systems so that they
perform in conformance with the reported criteria. This written operations and management information replaces
verbal communications and provides a training document whenever new personnel or new contractors are introduced
to the site. Operating information should formally reflect changes in control strategies that typically occur in
facilities to accommodate change in use or energy conservation efforts. This is an essential element because of the
interdependence between outside air ventilation rate and the automatic temperature control system. In almost all
buildings the performance of the ventilation system is affected by space temperature control needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3)(v) proposes to require a written maintenance program for those building system components that
directly affect IAQ because failure to do so may result in the degradation of IAQ in the facility. A written maintenance
program is believed to be necessary because levels of HVAC system maintenance vary dramatically and sometimes are
deficient where untrained personnel are designated to maintain very complex systems. The following are examples
of maintenance deficiencies which have been associated with IAQ problems: plugged drains on cooling coil condensate
drip pans resulting in microbial contamination of pan; failed exhaust fans in underground parking garages which
allow carbon monoxide to infiltrate into the building above; microbial fouling of cooling tower water from lack of
water treatment with biocides resulting in legionellosis cases; and failure of automatic temperature control system
resulting in lack of outside ventilation air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance of HVAC equipment, for example, may include simple housekeeping of equipment and air transport pathways,
lube and adjustment programs for rotating machinery, and catastrophic failure maintenance to repair/replace failed
equipment. There appears to be consensus among HVAC maintenance personnel that the most successful maintenance
programs, gauged in terms of system performance and life-cycle economics, are proactive rather than reactive. Consequently,
OSHA is promoting preventive maintenance programs for those building system components which affect IAQ. At a minimum,
the maintenance program should describe the equipment to be maintained, establish maintenance procedures and frequency
of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3)(vi) proposes to require a checklist to guide periodic inspections of building systems. This checklist
should focus on those building system components whose failure, degradation, or misuse would adversely impact indoor
air quality. The checklist shall include but not be limited to inspection of the following components and performance
criteria: fibrous liner used for acoustics and insulation in airhandlers and ducts should be inspected for erosion
and moisture; smoke-trails testing should be performed to verify design pressurization schemes like negative pressure
smoking rooms; ceiling, floor and wall surfaces should be examined for signs of water leaks which could support and
amplify microbial contamination; and outside air louvers, intake paths, dampers, actuators, and linkages should
be checked for obstruction.

Paragraph (c)(5) proposes to require the establishment of records of employee complaints of building-related illnesses
as part of the written program. These records are believed to be necessary to expedite review and evaluation of the
system and to support implementation and operation of an adequate IAQ program [Exs. 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444b, 3&hyph;502].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that effective system operation and maintenance will necessarily rely upon written information
and records such as those relating to design expectations, system capacities, code requirements, maintenance activities
and system evaluations. As with other OSHA rulemakings, the written compliance plan is to be accessible to employees.

Compliance Program Implementation: Paragraph (d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph proposes to require that the employer take certain actions to maintain acceptable indoor air quality.
These actions primarily address means that OSHA believes necessary to achieve continued adequate and proper functioning
of building systems [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;55, 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;61,
3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;329, 3&hyph;364, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;436, 3&hyph;444A, 3&hyph;479,
3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;501, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;507, 3&hyph;529, 3&hyph;531]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) proposes to require that employers maintain and operate the HVAC system to provide at least the minimum
outdoor air ventilation rate, based on actual occupancy, required by the applicable building code, mechanical code,
or ventilation code in effect at the time the facility was constructed, renovated, or remodelled, whichever was most
recent [Ex. 3&hyph;18]. Paragraph (d)(2) proposes to require employers to conduct building system inspection and
necessary maintenance activities as often as necessary to reduce the likelihood of indoor air quality problems related
to the building systems [Ex. 3&hyph;26]. Further requirements under paragraph (d) are: Assure that the HVAC system
is operable during all work shifts, (d)(3) [Exs. 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;226, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;436]; implement the
use of general or local ventilation where maintenance activities may result in hazardous chemical or particulate
exposures in other areas of the building, (d)(4) [Exs. 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;502]; maintain relative humidity below
60% in buildings with mechanical cooling systems, (d)(5) [Exs. 3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;505B]; during regular
maintenance, as described in subparagraph (d)(1), measure carbon dioxide levels. When they exceed 800 ppm, check
to make sure the HVAC system is operating as it should and correct deficiencies if necessary, (d)(6) [Exs. 3&hyph;10,
3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;214]; assure that buildings without mechanical ventilation are maintained so that windows,
doors, vents, etc., designed or used for natural ventilation are in operable condition, (d)(7); assure that mechanical
equipment rooms and any non-ducted air plenums or chases are maintained in a clean condition, free of hazardous substances,
and asbestos, if friable, is encapsulated or removed so that it does not enter the air distribution system, (d)(8)
[Exs. 3&hyph;29, 3&hyph;500]; assure that inspections and maintenance of the HVAC system are performed by or under
the direction of the designated person, (d)(9) [Ex. 3&hyph;29]; establish a record of HVAC system inspections and
maintenance, (d)(10) [Ex. 3&hyph;26]; assure that employees performing work on HVAC systems are provided with and
use appropriate personal protective equipment, (d)(11) [Ex. 3&hyph;56]; evaluate the need to perform alterations
of the HVAC system in response to employee reports of building-related illness, (d)(12); and take such remedial measures
as the evaluation shows to be necessary, (d)(13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that implementation of each of the actions prescribed in this proposed paragraph are integral elements
in the indoor air quality program. Provisions which address inspection, maintenance, alteration, and operation
of building systems are believed to be essential to ensure successful functioning of system functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) proposes to require that employers operate and maintain the HVAC system to provide at least the minimum
outside air ventilation rate. Available evidence in the literature supports this requirement. The literature which
supports the case for ventilation with outside air falls into two categories. One category includes case studies
which are generated when IAQ complaints require on-site responses and the investigators report their findings through
IAQ forums sponsored by professional organizations like the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers, Inc. and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. These studies report that the lack of outside ventilation
air resulting from operational or maintenance deficiencies as one of the causes of IAQ complaints. Many of the studies
include abatement recommendations to ventilate with outside air as feasible per the original design intent. The
second category includes research projects which also support the case for ventilating buildings with at least the
recommended minimum of outside air. Research in the areas of ventilation efficiency, tracer gas analysis, dilution/removal
of internally generated contaminants, and environmental perceptions mostly support this contention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All three major building codes in the United States which are used in the design of new and retrofitted facilities mandate
minimum outside air ventilation rates in mechanically-ventilated buildings. These three code bodies include the
Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), the International Conference of Building
Officials (ICBO), and the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI). Per Section 102 of the 1991
Uniform Building Code as promulgated by the ICBO, the purpose of the building code is ``to offer minimum standards
to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction,
quality of materials, use and occupancy *&blank;*&blank;*''. Clearly, there is a significant commitment of resources
by these code bodies to offer design guidance through the building codes to designers to insure that a facility is capable
of delivering a minimum amount of outside air to its' occupants. This concept is supported by the efforts of plan reviewers
and building inspectors in local governmental jurisdictions throughout the United States who ensure that facilities
are constructed per the building codes. Considering the up-front efforts of these code officials, designers, and
construction teams, it is reasonable from a standpoint of continuity, to require that buildings be operated and maintained
to the same design intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is not meant to require rebuilding or retrofitting HVAC systems in response to minor work. For example,
such steps would not be required for any renovation work that does not modify the building's configuration or the conditions
that would be affected by the building code applicable at the time the system was installed or last modified.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of maintenance, there should be a predictive element which periodically checks the HVAC system to evaluate
conformance with paragraph (d). This check should conform with the proposals of paragraph (d)(2) which requires
an inspection and maintenance of the building systems. This periodic visual inspection is focused by the checklist
outlined in paragraph (c) and targets those components that directly impact indoor air quality. In the field of occupational
safety and health, as practiced by industrial hygienists, it is common practice to perform walk-around inspections.
On the other hand, the HVAC industry often relies heavily on remote sensing to characterize system performance. Therefore,
this required visual inspection will help identify those deficiencies that would otherwise be missed, such as microbial
contamination in cooling coil condensate drip pans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3) requires that the facility HVAC system is operating during all workshifts. The employer must provide
the minimum outside ventilation rate for contaminant dilution and removal whenever the building is occupied and
used. OSHA understands that the minimum outside air ventilation rate may in practice only be provided when the building
is fully occupied or utilized. It is not uncommon for office buildings to be occupied from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. to accommodate
flexible work schedules but the HVAC system may only be in operation from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to conserve energy. The technical
rationale for this strategy is typically based on the recommendations of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) in their Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable
Indoor Air Quality''. Section 6.1.3.4 and Appendix ``G'' of ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 [Ex. 4&hyph;333] offers
a rationale for the lead/lag operation of ventilation systems to accommodate transient occupancy. The basis for
the rationale is that there is capacity in air to dilute contaminants if the space has been previously unoccupied for
several hours. This strategy, however, applies only to occupant generated contaminants like carbon dioxide and
odors. Housekeeping cleaning agents or pesticides are typical of contaminants that may be released which could not
be absorbed by a non-ventilated space. Consequently, other contaminants must be diluted/removed by the ventilation
system whenever the building is occupied. In addition, it is recognized that certain automatic temperature control
strategies can also prevent a facility from receiving the minimum outside air ventilation rate. The obvious example
is the early morning warm-up cycle wherein the outside air dampers are kept shut in the morning until the space temperature
recovers from the setback temperature of the night before. These energy conservation and temperature control strategies
must not interfere with providing minimum outside air ventilation when the building is occupied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(4) proposes to require the employer to utilize general or local exhaust ventilation, as provided by
the existing HVAC system or auxiliary systems, to minimize the hazards associated with maintenance or housekeeping
activities. The literature reports IAQ/BRI episodes that were initiated with activities like painting, carpet
cleaning and floor resurfacing. If these activities occur during unoccupied periods then chemical vapors from paints
and adhesives and excessive moisture from carpet cleaning may be diluted and removed by the outside air ventilation
function of the HVAC system. During occupied periods, efforts should be made to restrict transportation of hazardous
contaminants from these activities throughout the facility by the HVAC air distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(5) proposes to require the employer to maintain occupied space relative humidities below 60% in buildings
with mechanical cooling systems. Moisture in a building may support and amplify microbial contamination with potential
for aerosolization. Both the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.
(ASHRAE) in their Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'', section 5.11
[Ex. 4&hyph;333] and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in their 1989 ``Guidelines
for the Assessment of Bioaerosols in the Indoor Environment'' [Ex. 3&hyph;61] recommend that relative humidity
in the occupied space be maintained below 60%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is inviting comments on whether a relative humidity of 60% is the appropriate upper limit to inhibit microbial
growth or if a higher limit is appropriate. In addition, OSHA would like comment on whether there should be a lower level
of relative humidity as recommended by ASHRAE and ACGIH to reduce irritation effects due to low relative humidity.
And finally, OSHA would like additional comment on whether it is feasible in hot and humid climates to achieve relative
humidities of 60% or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(6) proposes to require the employer to monitor for carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the occupied space as part of maintenance or employee complaint investigations. When the concentration exceeds
800 ppm, the employer would be required to check the operation of the HVAC system. CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is frequently used as a gross surrogate indicator of indoor air quality. Ideally, by knowing the rate of accumulation
of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the space and the rate of generation of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by respiring occupants in the space, it would be possible to predict the rate of removal of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the space by the HVAC system. Because buildings have average occupant densities to generate CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the concentration is an indicator of the HVAC system's ability to dilute and remove occupant generated contaminants
like CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, water vapor, and odors (human bioeffluents). However, the CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentration and the associated outside air ventilation rate offers no confidence as to the adequacy of dilution
and removal of other contaminants released in the space. If the outside air ventilation rate is insufficient to dilute
and remove CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, then it can be assumed that other contaminant concentrations will also be elevated. The literature reports that
CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in the space under 800 ppm will minimize health-related complaints [Exs. 3&hyph;34A, 4&hyph;331].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(8) proposes to require the employer to restrict the presence of hazardous substances in air distribution
systems. The HVAC air distribution system itself should not be the source of hazardous contaminants due to its' critical
nature as a potential pathway to building occupants. Enclosed ducts are typically not used to store hazardous substances
but non-ducted air transport pathways such as area-ways, plenums, chases, corridors, and mechanical rooms serving
as return air plenums are sometimes used for storage. If these air transport pathways are used for storage, then the
employer must be especially careful to make sure that no spillage or leakage of hazardous substances occurs. This
will insure that the pathways are kept free of hazardous substances.

Paragraph (d)(11) proposes to require that employees working on building systems are provided with and use personal
protective equipment (PPE) as required by other OSHA standards including; 29 CFR 1926, Subpart E, Personal Protective
and Life Saving Equipment; 29 CFR 1926.52, Occupational Noise Exposure; 29 CFR 1910, Subpart I, Personal Protective
Equipment; and 29 CFR 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure.

OSHA is aware, through its experience and through the literature and submissions to the docket, that HVAC Operations
and Maintenance (O&amp;M) personnel may often receive minimal training regarding existing relevant OSHA regulations
and the hazards that they are exposed to in the performance of their duties. Sometimes, facilities are not viewed as
industrial workplaces by either the management or employees. However, the hazards do exist and therefore compliance
with existing regulations is necessary to protect the health and safety of O&amp;M employees. Respirators may not
normally be used in this industry due to the perceived lack of a substance-specific hazard. But situations may occur,
for instance, such as chemical or microbial contamination, that would require compliance with 1910.134.

Other provisions of this section require; that buildings without mechanical ventilation be operated and maintained
to provide natural ventilation; that inspections and maintenance of building systems be performed by or under the
supervision of the designated person; that the employer establish a written record of building system inspections
and maintenance required under this section; that the employer evaluate the need to perform modifications to the
building systems to meet the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section in response to employee
complaints of building-related illnesses.

Controls for Specific Contaminant Sources: Paragraph (e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph proposes to require employers to take specific protective measures to control employee exposure
to specific agents such as tobacco smoke [Exs. 3&hyph;7, 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;291, 3&hyph;305, 3&hyph;409,
3&hyph;449, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;505B], outdoor pollutants [Ex. 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505],
contaminant emissions from local indoor sources [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;412],
microbial contaminants [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505,
3&hyph;506], hazardous chemicals including cleaning and maintenance chemicals and pesticides [Exs. 3&hyph;56,
3&hyph;436, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;505]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to tobacco smoke in workplaces where smoking is not prohibited, paragraph (e)(1) proposes to require
the establishment of designated smoking areas. Such areas must be enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside,
and maintained under negative pressure sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Smoking
is not permitted during cleaning and maintenance work in these designated smoking areas. Moreover, although cleaning
and maintenance are specified in this paragraph, it is OSHA's intent that no work of any kind shall be performed in a
designated smoking area when smoking is taking place. Designated smoking areas must be areas where employees do not
have to enter in the performance of normal work activities. Signs must also be posted at designated smoking areas.
Signs must be posted to inform anyone entering the building that smoking is restricted to designated areas. Finally,
smoking within designated areas is not permitted during any time that the exhaust ventilation system servicing that
area is not operating properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provisions under paragraph (e)(1) addressing control of tobacco smoke are intended to ensure that employees
outside of the designated smoking area will not be exposed to ETS. The Agency anticipates that the provisions as proposed
will accomplish that goal. Enclosing smoking areas, exhausting them to the outside, maintaining them under negative
pressure, and prohibiting smoking in designated areas even when the exhaust system is inoperable are believed to
be necessary and sufficient to prevent tobacco smoke from migrating to other areas of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designated smoking area must be under negative pressure compared to all surrounding spaces including adjoining
rooms, corridors, plenums and chases. Negative pressure is achieved by exhausting more air from the space than is
supplied to the space.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transfer air must enter the designated smoking room to make-up the volumetric flowrate differential between supply
and exhaust air. It may be necessary to provide a tight architectural enclosure so as to achieve negative pressure
and containment. Leakage through a lay-in ceiling tile system may occur if there is a return air plenum above it. Negative
pressure will induce airflow into the room through the entrance door undercut. Containment may be checked by using
smoke-trails at the door undercut to verify direction of airflow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contaminated exhaust air from a designated smoking room must be transported to the outside through exhaust ducts
under negative pressure to avoid duct leakage into nonsmoking areas that the duct passes through. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions regarding posting of signs are intended to prevent inadvertent entry into smoking areas, and inadvertent
smoking in areas other than designated smoking areas. To prevent involuntary exposure, designated smoking areas
cannot be areas where employees perform normal work activities. For the same reason, smoking is not permitted in smoking
areas during performance of work activities such as cleaning and maintenance of the designated smoking area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision will have special impact on establishments such as bars and restaurants. OSHA invites comments on
feasibility considerations relative to such establishments and suggestions for alternative ways to assure that
nonsmoking workers will not be exposed to tobacco smoke there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e)(2) establishes requirements dealing with outdoor air pollutants and contaminants emitted
locally within workspaces. This paragraph proposes to require the employer to implement measures to restrict the
entry of outdoor air pollutants into the building and to control local indoor sources of air contaminant emissions
by employing other control measures like substitution or local source capture exhaust ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e)(3) proposes to require the control of microbial contamination by routinely inspecting for
and repairing water leaks that can promote growth of biologic agents, by promptly drying, replacing, removing, or
cleaning damp or wet materials; and by taking measures to remove visible microbial contamination in ductwork, humidifiers,
other HVAC system components, or on other building surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e)(4) addresses the use of cleaning and maintenance chemicals, pesticides and other hazardous
chemicals. Pesticides must be used according to manufacturers' recommendations, and where chemicals are to be used,
employees in those areas affected are to be informed, at least within 24 hours prior to use, of the type of chemical to
be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions proposed under (e)(2) are intended to ensure that indoor air quality is not degraded as a result of entry
of outdoor contaminants, such as vehicle exhaust, or by circulation of contaminants generated within the building.
The Agency believes that, where necessary, entry of outdoor air pollutants can be restricted by eliminating or repositioning
entry points into the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indoor local contaminant emissions can be minimized where necessary, through application of control measures such
as source substitution and engineering controls that may include local source capture exhaust ventilation. Collection
of contaminants at their source of emission through engineering controls is an accepted basic principle of industrial
hygiene. Equipment and processes which are located or take place in areas that may lead to contamination of other areas
should be provided with engineering controls, where necessary and feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions proposed in paragraph (e)(3) are intended to limit the opportunity for microbiological contamination
of building systems and structures. Although individual microbes are not visible to the naked eye, colonies of microbes
are. Moisture can lead to microbiological growth in indoor spaces, within HVAC systems, or within building structures,
and thus to a variety of detrimental health effects. The employer therefore, is required to take preventive and corrective
actions to minimize microbiological growth. Preventive action includes routine inspection for biological growth,
with required corrective actions such as repairing water leaks, drying, replacing, or cleaning wet materials, and
removal of visible microbiological growth (Exs. 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;502). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions proposed in paragraph (e)(4) are intended to restrict indoor exposure to hazardous substances such
as pesticides and chemicals used for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The Agency believes that proper use of such
substances is important to limit incidental exposures to those performing cleaning and maintenance as well as to
other employees who might be incidentally exposed. Manufacturers recommendations for use of these products often
address aspects of ventilation, employee protection, occupancy limitations, and other protective measures. Thus,
the Agency has proposed to require that chemicals covered under this paragraph must be used in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations. To further limit the potential for incidental exposures to these chemicals the standard proposes
to require that employees in areas to be treated by such chemicals are to be notified within at least 24 hours prior to
their application.

Air Quality During Renovation and Remodeling: Paragraph (f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(1) proposes to require implementation of specific procedures to minimize degradation of air quality
during renovation and remodeling activities (Exs. 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;444B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(2) proposes to require development and implementation of a work plan to restrict entry of air contaminants
into other work areas during remodeling, renovation, and similar activities (Ex. 3&hyph;444b). Where appropriate,
elements of the workplan to be considered are requirements of this standard, implementation of means to assure that
HVAC systems continue to function effectively during remodeling and renovation activities, isolation or containment
of work areas and appropriate negative pressure containment, air contaminant suppression controls or auxiliary
air filtration, and controls to prevent air contaminant entry into HVAC systems. Finally, paragraph (e)(3), proposes
to require 24 hour advance notification of employees, or promptly in emergency situations, of work to be performed
on the building that may introduce air contaminants into their work area. Such notification must include anticipated
adverse impacts on indoor air quality or workplace conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions under proposed paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) are intended to ensure that renovation, remodeling and
similar activities are performed in a manner that will reduce the potential for air contaminants generated during
those activities from entering other areas of the building. Such activities which may involve demolition, sanding,
surface refinishing, component removal and replacement, etc. can result in hazardous substance emission from solvents,
paints, carpets, etc. and can also produce high levels of particulate contamination. To control such emissions,
the standard proposes to require employers to develop a workplan for the implementation of appropriate work procedures
and controls such as exhaust ventilation, isolation, containment, or use of wet methods during renovation and remodeling
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (f)(3) proposes to require notification of employees in the vicinity of renovation and remodeling
activities who may be subject to incidental exposure to emissions produced during such activities (Ex. 3&hyph;444B).
This notification must also apprise affected employees of the potential adverse impact on air quality. Informing
employees of potential workplace hazards is felt by the Agency to be imperative for the success of any safety and health
program. OSHA believes that employees can do much to protect themselves if they are informed of the nature of the hazards
to which they are exposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (g) proposes to require employers to provide special training for workers involved in maintenance activities
and those involved in HVAC system operations, and to provide certain pertinent information to all employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(1) proposes to require that maintenance and HVAC operations personnel be trained in the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE) required to be worn; training on how to maintain adequate ventilation of exhaust fumes
during building cleaning and maintenance; and training of maintenance personnel on how to minimize adverse effects
on indoor air quality during the use and disposal of chemicals and other agents [Exs. 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;41,
3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;440, 3&hyph;444B, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(2) proposes to require that all employees shall be informed of the contents of the standard and its appendices,
signs and symptoms associated with building-related illness, and the requirement under proposed subparagraphs
(d)(12) and (d)(13) which directs the employer to evaluate the effectiveness of the building systems, if necessary,
upon receipt of complaints from employees of building-related illness [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;412,
3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444B, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;529]. The information proposed to be provided under
this subparagraph need not be conveyed to employees through formal training sessions or courses. Informing employees
can be accomplished, for example, through written means such as fact sheets, memos, or posted bulletins. OSHA will
provide in a non-mandatory appendix to the final rule an example illustrating what information is to be provided to
employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(3) proposes to require that the employer make training materials developed under these provisions,
including the standard and its appendices, available for inspection and copying by employees, designated employee
representatives, the Director, and the Assistant Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training and information requirements are routine components of OSHA health standards. The inclusion of training
and information requirements reflects the Agency's conviction, as noted above, that informed employees are essential
to the operation of any effective health program. OSHA believes that informing and training employees about the hazards
to which they are exposed will contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of diseases caused by workplace
conditions. Further, as noted earlier, it has been OSHA's experience that unacceptable indoor air quality is often
the result of deficiencies in implementing effective HVAC system operation and maintenance programs. The Agency
believes that specialized training of workers performing those activities is, therefore, necessary to ensure successful
performance of their jobs.

Recordkeeping: Paragraph (h) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h) proposes to require that employers maintain records of: All written information regarding the IAQ
compliance program required to be established under paragraph (c); inspection and maintenance records required
to be established under paragraph (d) [Ex. 3&hyph;26], which must include the specific remedial or maintenance actions
taken, the name and affiliation of the individual performing the work, and the date of the inspection or maintenance
activity; and records of employee complaints of building-related illness required to be established under paragraph
(c)(5) of this section [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) also proposes to require the employer to retain these for at least the previous three years [Ex. 3&hyph;502],
except that operation, maintenance, inspection, and compliance program records need not be retained for three years
if rendered obsolete by the establishment and replacement of more recent records, or rendered irrelevant due to HVAC
system replacement or redesign. The records required to be maintained by the employer are to be made available to employees
and their designated representative and the Assistant Secretary for examination and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (h)(6) proposes to require that whenever the employer ceases to do business records that are required
to be maintained by the employer are to be provided to and retained by the successor employer [Ex. 3&hyph;440B]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8 (c) of the Act authorizes OSHA to require employers to make, keep, and preserve, and make available to the
Secretary or the Director records regarding their activities as prescribed by regulation as appropriate and necessary
for the enforcement of the Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational
illnesses. As noted earlier, the Agency believes that development of written compliance plans are essential to implementation
of a successful IAQ program. The written compliance program, inspection and maintenance records, and operator and
maintenance schedules which are required to be established under the proposal, are required to be retained under
this paragraph. This information essentially documents the desired performance levels of HVAC systems, and the
measures necessary to maintain those levels of performance, as well as other measures which should be followed to
ensure acceptable indoor air quality. Such data must be available for use by designated persons, current employers,
successor employers, and employees as a blueprint for program implementation. Without such data, air quality problems
would likely arise due to ignorance of such elements as design occupant densities, equipment schedules, maintenance
requirements and frequencies, etc. Records required to be established in response to employee complaints of building-related
illness are also required to be retained under this paragraph. Such complaints require the employer to evaluate the
need for, and to take if necessary, remedial action to correct observed problems [Ex. 3&hyph;1, 3&hyph;444B]. Information
regarding employee illness is essential in identifying causal factors and trends in adverse health effects. Retention
of this health data will aid in the recognition, evaluation and correction of indoor air quality deficiencies which
lead to building-related illnesses. Records of building-related illness are proposed to be required to be retained
for at least the previous 3 years. OSHA believes that requiring record retention for 3 years of building-related illnesses
which occur in nonindustrial environments is reasonable. Such illnesses are not viewed in the same context as industrial
illnesses which may be associated with long latency periods, and thus necessitate very long retention periods for
health records. Establishment and maintenance of building-related illness records is primarily for the purpose
of documenting indoor air quality degradation, so that corrective action can be taken. Requiring records to be retained
to preserve a 3 year history of building-related illness, is proposed as being reasonable to aid in the tracking of
air quality trends and past experiences [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other records are also required to be retained for at least the previous 3 years, except to the extent they become obsolete.
OSHA does not believe that records such as maintenance and operating schedules which become irrelevant due to HVAC
system modification or replacement need be retained further. The records required to be retained under this paragraph
must be transferred to successor employers. Since these records contain information specific to the building or
facility, as opposed to specific employers, such records should be maintained within affected buildings for future
use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA solicits data, views and comment on all provisions proposed in this notice. The Agency sets forth questions below
to highlight specific areas in the proposal upon which comment is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Analysis Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Are there any comments on the method used by OSHA to estimate benefits resulting from IAQ provisions of the proposed
standard?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are there studies which document, in quantitative terms, the effectiveness of HVAC maintenance on the decline
of indoor air related ailments?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) OSHA has estimated a substantial productivity benefit resulting from this proposed standard. What additional
studies and other information are available that demonstrate any effect on productivity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) OSHA has preliminarily determined that the direct costs of compliance with this standard will not unduly harm
small entities. However, OSHA did not determine how the smoking restrictions in this regulation would affect demand,
and therefore profitability, for establishments which provide services and commodities which would be affected
by the proposal (e.g., restaurants and bars). OSHA requests comments, including empirical data regarding the demand
elasticity of such establishments' patrons who will not be permitted to smoke in the presence of employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If economic feasibility is shown to be an issue for establishments such as bars and restaurants, what alternative
feasible methods of compliance would prevent workers from being exposed to tobacco smoke?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What other workplaces have circumstances under which provisions of this standard may not be feasible?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) During renovation and remodelling, what are the specific elements for implementing control measures to minimize
degradation of the IAQ of employees performing such activities and employees in other areas of the building? What
are the unit costs associated with the implementation of each control (capital and labor)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Please describe practices in your workplace by providing answers to the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Describe the business, SIC code number and number of employees in the establishment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_What type of ventilation systems are presently being used?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If carbon dioxide monitoring is conducted, how often is it being done and by whom and what are the associated costs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Does your establishment have a policy on IAQ? When and why was it implemented? What are the major components? How many
employees are affected? What type of costs and cost savings have been associated with such a policy (e.g., operating,
maintenance, retrofitting HVAC systems, property damage due to poor IAQ, employee productivity, cleaning, etc.)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Is smoking allowed in your establishment? If yes, is it limited to designated smoking areas with separate ventilation?

Scope and Application, Paragraph (a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Is it necessary and feasible to extend coverage of the entire standard to industrial facilities as well as nonindustrial
facilities? Why? Why not? Which provisions lend themselves to application to industrial environments?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Can coverage of the standard feasibly be extended to some industrial facilities but not others? If so, what characteristics
distinguish those workplaces in which it is feasible or necessary to apply the standard from those in which it is not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The regulation as drafted would require employers generally to prohibit smoking by their customers (such as in
bars, restaurants, and stores) where not already banned by a government entity if employees would be exposed to ETS
from customer smoking. Comment is requested on the appropriateness of this provision, possible alternatives, and
feasibility issues.

Definitions, Paragraph (b)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Is the proposed definition of ``air contaminants'' sufficiently descriptive to inform employers of the hazards
which may adversely affect indoor air quality? If not, what additional information should be included in the definition?
Which elements included in the definition are not reflective of hazards which affect indoor air quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Can employers reasonably be expected to be able to detect the presence of air contaminants, as defined, and determine
whether they present a significant risk of material impairment of employee health? What methods are available to
detect indoor air contaminants? What criteria should be used to evaluate the degree of risk that the presence of air
contaminants pose to employees?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the proposed definition of ``building systems'' sufficiently descriptive to indicate which systems the employer
must attend to in order to assure acceptable indoor air quality? Are the systems listed in the definition those that
directly affect indoor air quality? If not, why not? What other systems affect indoor air quality that are not specifically
cited in the definition, and how do they influence indoor air quality? How must such systems be maintained and operated
in order to assure adequate indoor air quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the term ``building-related illness'' sufficiently descriptive and inclusive of the medical conditions
that can arise from poor indoor air quality? If not, what other medical conditions should be addressed under the definition
and why? Which conditions listed in the definition, if any, should not be considered as ``building-related illness''
and why?

(4) Is it necessary and appropriate to require employers to authorize a ``designated person'' to be responsible for
ensuring compliance with an indoor air quality standard? Why? Why not? If it is appropriate to require a designated
person, what training should designated persons have in order to carry out their responsibilities under the proposed
rule? Should the designated person be a person who is a full-time employee who is within the facility each day? Should
a designated person be on-site during each shift? Is it unreasonable to expect that due to the complexity of building
systems, a single designated person within a facility can successfully oversee and ensure adequate operation of
all building systems that affect indoor air quality? Why? Why not? Would it be beneficial for the designated person
to receive an inventory of chemical and physical agents used by all employers on site in order to track chemical usage
and storage? Information collected could include date of receipt, amount applied or used, where and when in the facility
it was used, and how the remainder is stored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Does the definition of the term ``HVAC system'' identify all components of HVAC systems which can adversely affect
indoor air quality if not properly operated and maintained? What other components should be included and why? What
components designated in the definition do not affect indoor air quality and why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Is the definition of ``nonindustrial work environment'' sufficiently descriptive to differentiate them from
industrial work environments? If not, what other descriptors should be included in the definition? Which types of
facilities and establishments proposed under the definition as nonindustrial work environments should not be subject
to this standard and why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Is the definition of ``renovation and remodeling'' appropriately descriptive of such activities? If not, what
modifications to the definition would more reasonably reflect industry view of the characteristics of such activities?

Indoor Air Quality Compliance Program, Paragraph (c)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Is it necessary and appropriate to require employers to establish a written IAQ compliance program in order to
assure the adequacy of indoor air quality in nonindustrial work environments? Why? Why not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If establishment of a written compliance program is necessary, are the informational elements proposed to be
developed under this rule appropriate and why? What is their function for successful implementation of the program?
Which other written material should be made part of the IAQ compliance program and why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Which informational elements proposed to be established as part of the IAQ program, if any, are irrelevant to successful
building system operation and maintenance? Why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Which informational elements proposed to be established as part of the IAQ program, if any, are not generally available
to the employer and why?

Compliance Program Implementation, Paragraph (d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Which of the implementation actions proposed under this paragraph are necessary and appropriate for maintenance
of acceptable indoor air quality. Why? Which are not? Why not? In this regard, specific comment is particularly sought
on the need for the following proposed elements of the implementation program:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Maintenance and operation of the HVAC system to provide at least a required minimum outside air ventilation rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Operation of the HVAC during all work shifts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use of exhaust ventilation during maintenance and housekeeping activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Maintenance of relative humidity to below 60%;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Requiring HVAC system evaluation where CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels exceed 800 ppm; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Requiring building system evaluation in response to employee complaints of building related illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Should the regulation prohibit the storage of hazardous substances in air transport pathways serving as return
air plenums? These areas may include area-ways, plenums, chases, corridors, and mechanical rooms serving as return
air plenums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Controls for Specific Contaminant Sources, Paragraph (e)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Will the proposed provisions addressing construction and operation of designated smoking areas assure that
employees working outside designated areas will not be exposed to ETS? If so, which of the proposed provisions may
be unnecessary to achieve this goal? If not, is it necessary to prohibit smoking within indoor workplaces to eliminate
exposure to ETS or can the provisions as proposed be modified, or supplemented to prevent secondary exposure? If it
is believed that designated smoking areas will effectively contain tobacco smoke, comment is particularly sought
on the appropriateness of requiring designated smoking areas to be enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside and
maintained under negative pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the proposed provision requiring the use of measures such as local source capture exhaust ventilation or substitution
to control air contaminants emitted from point sources where general ventilation is inadequate, feasible or effective?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are the proposed provisions addressing control of microbial contamination effective, feasible, or necessary?
Why? Why not? What additional provisions, if any, should be included to preclude microbial contamination for adversely
affecting indoor air quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where hazardous chemicals are used in the workplace, including cleaning and maintenance chemicals, is employee
notification of their use 24 hours prior to their application, as proposed, necessary to mitigate potential incidental
exposure to such chemicals? To what extent does the use of such chemicals in nonindustrial environments present a
health risk to other employees, or to the acceptability of indoor air quality? Which chemicals and their uses are of
particular concern in non-industrial indoor environments?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are the proposed provisions specifically addressing renovation and remodeling activities necessary and appropriate
and why? Particularly, are the proposed requirements to develop a work plan focusing special attention on HVAC systems,
area isolation or containment, and air contaminant suppression controls necessary to limit the potential for degradation
of air quality? Why? Why not? What other provisions, if any, should be included to limit the effects that renovation
and remodeling activities may have on indoor environments?

Employee Information and Training, Paragraph (g)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Are the provisions proposing that building systems maintenance workers receive special training with respect
to the use of personal protective equipment, use of ventilation during cleaning and maintenance activities, and
on proper use and disposal of hazardous chemicals and other agents, necessary and appropriate to assure maintenance
of acceptable indoor air quality? Why? Why not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should training of building maintenance and systems workers include additional specific elements not proposed
in this notice? What should this additional training consist of and why? Which workers should this training be provided
to_all maintenance and building systems workers, supervisors, crew leaders? Should such training be provided periodically,
or would initial training suffice?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Will retention of records, as proposed, enhance the potential for reducing indoor air quality problems? Will
retention of maintenance records, IAQ compliance program records, and records of employee complaints serve as necessary
documentation upon which actions and decisions can be made to improve deficiencies found in facility air quality?
If so, how will these records serve that purpose?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What length of time should the records required to be established under this proposal be required to be retained?
Is OSHA's proposed 3-year retention period reasonable? Why? Why not? Should different retention periods be specified
for each particular record, and if so, why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VIII. State Plan Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable
standard within six months of the publication date of a final standard. These 25 states are: Alaska, Arizona, California,
Connecticut (for public employees only), New York (for state and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana,
Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a state
standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states.

IX. Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October
30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting
state policy options, consult with states prior to taking any actions which would restrict state policy options,
and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope.
The Order provides for preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so.
Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) expresses Congress' intent to preempt state laws that
establish occupational safety and health standards on issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated standards. Under
Section 18, a state can avoid preemption, however, if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Therefore states with occupational safety and health plans approved under
Section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems which might
be encountered in a particular state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Supreme Court has held that Section 18 does not preempt state or local laws of general applicability
that do not conflict with OSHA standards and that regulate the conduct of workers and non workers alike.

 112 S. Ct. 2374 (1992). Such laws regulate workers simply as members of the general public. OSHA recognizes that many
state and local governments have enacted provisions designed to protect the health of their residents by addressing
indoor air quality issues including the presence of ETS. It is OSHA's intent that state and local laws consistent with
this standard shall remain in effect to the full extent permissible.

X. Information Collection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 CFR part 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection
requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. This proposed indoor air quality standard
requires the employer to allow OSHA access to records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection
requirements for this proposal to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of that Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response. Send
any comments regarding this burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor, room N&hyph;1301, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

Filing of Testimony and Evidence Before the Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any party requesting more than ten (10) minutes for presentation at the informal public hearing, or who intends to
submit documentary evidence, must provide in quadruplicate the testimony and evidence to be presented at the informal
public hearing. One copy shall not be stapled or bound and be suitable for copying. These materials must be provided
to Mr. Thomas Hall, OSHA Division of Consumer Affairs at the address above and be postmarked no later than June 29, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each submission will be reviewed in light of the amount of time requested in the notice of intention to appear. In instances
where the information contained in the submission does not justify the amount of time requested, a more appropriate
amount of time will be allocated and the participant will be notified of that fact prior to the informal public hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any party who has not substantially complied with the above requirement may be limited to a ten-minute presentation
and may be requested to return for questioning at a later time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any party who has not filed a notice of intention to appear may be allowed to testify for no more than 10 minutes as time
permits, at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, but will not be allowed to question witnesses.

Conduct and Nature of Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding
will be resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and
is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative
Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative
in type. The Agency's intent, in essence, is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral
presentations which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which impede or protract
the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative
proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example do not apply. The regulations
that govern hearings and the pre-hearing guidelines to be issued for this hearing will ensure fairness and due process
and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines will be interpreted
in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation generally
will be decided so as to favor development of the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that &sect;1911.4 specifies the
Assistant Secretary may upon reasonable notice issue alternatives procedures to expedite proceedings or for other
good cause. The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation
on the merits of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing
proceeds at a reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the
powers necessary and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911 including
the powers: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To regulate the course of the proceedings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witness and to limit the time for questioning;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment
period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated
in the oral proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject
matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions
of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which
may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of the public response
on the issues involved.

_CARBON DIOXIDE MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL (NONMANDATORY) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) sampling is one of the measurement tools used to characterize indoor air quality. Indoor CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 air concentrations are indicator measures for effectiveness of building ventilation. Elevated carbon dioxide
levels can be an indicator of inadequate outside air exchange rates. Carbon dioxide concentrations below 800 ppm
generally indicate that the ventilation is adequate for diluting occupant-generated contaminants. The carbon
dioxide concentration and the associated outside air ventilation rate offers no confidence as to the adequacy of
dilution and removal of other contaminants released in the space. There is also no implication of health effects associated
with this level of carbon dioxide, or any implication of a permissible exposure limit. Health effects have been observed
in buildings where the carbon dioxide levels were below 800 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recommends this procedure:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Design a program of air sampling that includes samples taken: (a) at least every three months to detect the effects
of seasonal changes (summer/winter transition seasons); (b) after adjustments have been made to the HVAC system;
and (c) at any time there is reason to believe air quality has deteriorated. At least once a year carbon dioxide levels
should be monitored when the HVAC system is providing minimum outside air ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Measure carbon dioxide concentrations late in the morning (about 11:00 am) and late in the afternoon before workers
leave for home (about 3:30 pm). These are the times when carbon dioxide levels should be closest to equilibrium levels
and should give the best indication of effective air exchange rates. These normal use patterns may be altered by visitor
frequency and should be accounted for in the monitoring scheme.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Conduct the sampling at a height of between 3 and 5 feet above the floor, or about the height of employees' heads.
Make sure the samples are taken at least 2 feet from where people are breathing. Take the samples at a sufficient distance
from any other sources of carbon dioxide so these sources do not affect the measurements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Select sampling locations in normally-occupied areas where the ventilation mixing would be the least effective.
These areas might include corners of a room farthest from supply ducts and exhaust vents, locations surrounded by
barriers that might affect air movement, or rooms at the far end of a ventilation supply duct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Measure the carbon dioxide levels outside the building for comparison with the indoor levels. Average outdoor
carbon dioxide levels are typically 300 to 500 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Use colormetric detector tubes or other direct-reading instruments calibrated and operated according to the
manufacturer's instructions for measuring carbon dioxide concentrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take sampling and analytical error into account before comparing results with the 800 ppm benchmark. All measuring
devices have a degree of uncertainty associated with the results. An estimate of that uncertainty is called the sampling
and analytical error. The uncertainty can be reduced by taking more samples with the same device. Table A&hyph;1 can
be used to assure 95 percent confidence that the average of the results from a set of detector tube samples is less than
800 ppm. OSHA recommends these following steps: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Calculate the average of the measurements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Add the detector tube results together.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Divide that total by the number of samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Compare the average of the results with the number of samples taken in the second column in the table. If the average
is less than the number in the table, there is confidence that the CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels are less than 800 ppm. Example: Three samples are taken and the results are 650 ppm, 710 ppm, and 680 ppm. The average
of these three samples is 680 ppm (2,040 ppm divided by 3). The results indicate confidence that the carbon dioxide
levels are less than 800 ppm since the 680 ppm average of the three samples is less than 695 ppm

Table A&hyph;2 shows how to determine if the indoor sample results are significantly different from the results taken
outdoors. Use this table by following these steps: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Take the same number of samples indoors and outdoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Average the results of the outdoor and indoor samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Add the outdoor results together and divide by the number of samples taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Add the indoor results together and divide by the number of samples taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Compare the range of the outdoor and indoor samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Subtract the lowest sample result of the outdoor samples from the highest result for the outdoor samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Subtract the lowest sample result of the indoor samples from the highest result for the indoor samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Calculate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Delta, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
which is a term derived by subtracting the difference between the indoor average and the outdoor average and then multiplying
that result times 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Calculate the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
with the second column in the table below. If the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Test Statistic 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is more than the number found in the column, the difference is significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Three samples are taken indoors and three samples are taken outdoors. The results of the outdoor samples are 500
ppm, 580 ppm and 480 ppm. The results of the indoor samples are 650 ppm, 710 ppm, and 680 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The average of the outdoor samples is 520 ppm (1,560 ppm divided by 3) and the average of the indoor samples is 680
ppm (2,040 ppm divided by 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Range of the outdoor samples is 100 (580^480=100) and the Range of the indoor samples is 60 ppm (710^650). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ``Delta'' is 320; (680^520)&times;2=320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The ``Sum of the Ranges'' is 160; (100+60)=160. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The ``Test Statistic'' is 2 (320 divided by 160=2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Since the ``Test Statistic,'' 2, is greater the 0.974 found in the table for 3 samples, the indoor air levels of carbon
dioxide are significantly more than the outdoor air levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that a public meeting will be held to discuss testing procedures
to demonstrate that an over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug product protects users from ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation.
FDA is holding this meeting after considering public comments regarding UVA claims and testing procedures received
in response to the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking and letters sent by the agency. In addition, FDA is reopening
the administrative record for the proposed rulemaking for OTC sunscreen drug products to allow comment on matters
considered at the meeting. FDA intends to invite guests and consultants to address technical matters related to the
questions listed in this document. This meeting is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28194), FDA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC sunscreen drug products. In the
proposed rule, the agency discussed OTC sunscreen drug products that claim to provide protection from UVA radiation
and the public health significance of UVA radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28232 and 28233). The agency also discussed testing
procedures for sunscreens that absorb UVA radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28248 to 28250). The comment period for comments
related to UVA ingredients, claims, and testing closed on November 8, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that sunscreen drug products having UVA protection claims offer significant UVA protection, the agency
proposed that an OTC sunscreen ingredient must have an absorption spectrum extending to 360 nanometers (nm) or above
in order to display UVA protection claims in its labeling (58 FR 28194 at 28233). The product would also have to demonstrate
meaningful UVA protection by satisfying UVA testing procedures that would be included in the monograph. However,
these procedures have yet to be established. The agency requested specific comments on appropriate procedures to
be used. Previously, the agency had requested specific information on UVA protection factors (Ref. 1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule (58 FR 28194 at 28248 to 28250), the agency tentatively suggested that a testing method similar
to the one described by Lowe et al. (Ref. 2) could be used to demonstrate that a sunscreen drug product provides protection
against UVA radiation. This method uses 48- and 72-hour erythema reactions and 12- to 14-day melanogenesis in skin
sensitized with 8-methoxsalen (8&hyph;MOP). However, because the agency did not have enough information or data
to propose a method for determining UVA protection in the proposed rule, the agency stated that a method should be developed
and validated in the same manner as was the sunscreen testing procedure for protection against ultraviolet B (UVB)
radiation (i.e., sunscreen protection factor (SPF) testing). Furthermore, the agency requested comments and data
regarding an appropriate testing methodology for OTC sunscreen drug products that afford UVA protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received a substantial amount of comments, data, and information regarding UVA ingredients, claims,
and testing procedures. After evaluating the submitted material, the agency finds that there are two basic interrelated
questions regarding testing procedures for determining UVA protection that must be addressed before the agency
can complete its assessment of appropriate UVA ingredients and claims. These questions are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What action spectrum best describes the biological risk of UVA radiation (i.e., which ultraviolet radiation
wavelengths are most likely to cause biological damage), and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Which testing procedure best defines the UVA protection provided by a sunscreen drug product? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Action Spectra for UVA-Related Skin Damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments discussed the appropriate action spectrum for biological risk associated with UVA radiation.
One comment stated that, in developing a consensus regarding an acceptable assay for determining the UVA protection
provided by a sunscreen drug product, the specific UVA effect that is to be blocked must be considered. These effects
include UVA erythema, UVA-induced drug photosensitivity, immediate pigment darkening, delayed tanning, or other
effects of photodamage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that several action spectra describing different aspects of solar-induced skin damage have been
determined in a number of different species and cell types. The comment described these aspects as photocarcinogenesis,
DNA damage, photoaging, mutagenicity, and immunosuppression. The comment maintained that each action spectrum
for UV-induced damage closely tracks the human erythemal action spectrum. The comment stated that the best summary
of the biological risk of UV light has been published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) (Ref.
3). The CIE Hazard Spectrum embodies the comprehensive, yet normal, risks to human skin due to full-spectrum UV exposure
and reflects the findings of the action spectra biological responses to UV described above. The CIE Hazard Spectrum
shows that the damage risk for UVB at 290 nm is 100 times higher than that at 320 nm. The damage risk at 320 nm is 100 times
higher than that at 400 nm. The damage risk at 320 nm is at least 10 times greater than the damage risk at 340 nm. This spectrum
shows that the most damage potential is in the UVB wavelengths (290 to 320 nm), followed by the shorter UVA wavelengths
(320 to 340 nm). The comment cited numerous scientific articles and submitted action spectra to support its statements
(Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that although protection against UVA is important, it is not as important as protection against
UVB. The comment argued that, based on the CIE Hazard Spectrum, the UVB wavelengths contribute 80 to 85 percent of the
damage risk in sunlight, while UVA contributes 15 to 20 percent of the damage risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that some known effects on humans caused by UVA radiation include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Photoaging of the skin,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) UVA-induced hypersensitivities,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Augmentation of skin cancers, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Erythema. However, the comment noted that there is no single known action spectrum to describe which parts of the
UVA spectrum are most active in causing these effects. Therefore, the comment maintained that it is not appropriate
to use the UVA-erythema action spectrum for testing purposes. The comment stated that UVA protection should be assessed
in relation to UVB protection and that the assumption should be made that all wavelengths are equally important.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that the ``current test for erythema'' is inadequate to test for the full spectrum of UVA radiation
because erythema is not a valid measurement of UVA exposure. The comment argued that using the erythema action spectrum
to test for UVA protection will give consumers a false sense of the extent of UVA protection afforded by a product. The
comment added that the immediate pigment darkening (IPD) action spectrum is preferable because it is broad enough
to take into account almost all UVA wavelengths. Another comment stated that the IPD action spectrum is indicative
of a true broad spectrum UVA response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that the IPD action spectrum was first described to extend from 300 to 420 nm, with a broad peak between
340 and 370 nm (Ref. 5). The action spectrum was later described to extend from 300 to 620 nm, with a peak effectiveness
between 400 and 500 nm (visible light) (Ref. 6). Because of the difference between these two reported spectra, the
comment reevaluated the action spectrum for IPD between 310 and 400 nm and reported that the IPD action spectrum extends
from 320 to 400 nm with a low peak around 340 nm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with determining which testing procedure is appropriate for use in validating the UVA protection provided
by a sunscreen drug product, the agency must determine what portion of the UVA spectrum should be blocked by the product
before consumers are effectively protected against the hazards of UVA radiation. The agency would like to consider
the following specific questions at the meeting: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Which action spectra are the most important with respect to skin damage caused by UVA radiation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is the erythema action spectrum an adequate surrogate for UVA biological risk, or is some other action spectrum
(such as the IPD action spectrum) more appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Can a sunscreen drug product that protects consumers against the shorter UVA wavelengths (320 to 340 nm) but not
against longer UVA wavelengths (340 to 400 nm) prevent significant UVA damage? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What should consumers expect from a sunscreen drug product that is labeled to provide protection against UVA radiation
or as a ``broad spectrum'' sunscreen? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. UVA Testing Procedures

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency did not propose a method for determining UVA protection in the tentative final monograph for OTC sunscreen
drug products. The agency stated that a method should be developed and validated in the same manner as the sunscreen
testing procedure for protection against UVB radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28250). The agency noted that any such method
should clearly demonstrate that a particular product provides significant protection against UVA radiation. The
method should include the use of a control sunscreen preparation that absorbs UVA radiation and that can be used to
assure the reliability of the testing procedure and equipment. The method should demonstrate that a sunscreen ingredient
either does or does not protect against UVA radiation. The agency requested comments and data regarding an appropriate
testing method for OTC sunscreen drug products that protect against UVA radiation. In response, the agency received
information and data pertaining to several UVA testing procedures, including both in vivo and in vitro test methods.

One comment recommended adoption of an in vitro test method that does not rely upon either photosensitization or nonsolar
light sources for determining UVA protection for normal skin (Ref. 8). According to the comment, this method involves:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Incorporating the sunscreen transmission spectrum into the convolution spectrum to obtain a UVA effectiveness
ratio which is conveniently expressed as a UVA protection percentage (APP). The comment maintained that, unlike
other methods, the APP represents the fraction of full spectrum UVA (320 to 400 nm) removed by a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment stated that because the original ``full spectrum'' method produces an SPF value analogous to the clinically
determined SPF number, the APP has direct relevance to the SPF determined on human subjects and is a subset of the full-spectrum
SPF determination. The comment added that once an SPF has been determined clinically, it is simple to take the full-spectrum
absorbance spectrum and calculate the APP based on the clinical test results. Therefore, although the determination
of the APP does involve in vitro measurements, it also relies on direct clinical measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment contended that there are a number of advantages to using the APP system:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It is a subset of the existing SPF for sunscreen drug products and, therefore, relates to an erythemal endpoint
in normal skin;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It does not unnecessarily duplicate clinical testing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It clearly demonstrates whether a sunscreen drug product provides meaningful protection against UVA radiation,
and it is useful in determining comparative UVA protection;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) It avoids the deficiencies of nonsolar light sources, photosensitizing chemicals, the failure of dose reciprocity
for human UVA exposures, and endpoints which do not relate to known UVA damage to human skin;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) It is independent of exposure dose or duration;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) It includes all the UVA wavelengths in their direct proportion and intensity as found in natural sunlight; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) It is directly relevant to overall product effectiveness. The comment added that in the absence of a light source
specific to the UVA range, APP determination is the best measurement of a product's UVA protection level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the in vitro APP test is difficult to extend to a human in vivo situation and that the test cannot
be used to study substantivity or stability. The comment added that because the APP test uses the erythema action spectrum
and a mathematical extraction of the UVA segment of the solar spectrum, it overestimates the actual amount of UVA radiation
blocked by most products. A reply comment argued that the APP technique is derived from well-studied and extensively
published in vitro SPF methodology (Refs. 9, 10, and 11), that it is simple to evaluate water resistance using this
model, and that data on water resistance have been published. The reply comment added that APP values are derived from
the same spectral data (320 to 400 nm) that provide in vitro SPF values. The final SPF value from clinical studies is
compared to the in vitro SPF and the absorbance spectrum can be matched to the exact clinical SPF for UVA calculations.
The UVA portion of the sunscreen's efficacy can then be calculated from the in vitro SPF data. Therefore, the comment
argued that the APP has direct relevance to the clinical effectiveness of the sunscreen product, but does not require
the exposure of human subjects to unnecessary UV radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that an in vitro method developed by Diffey and Robson (Ref. 12) avoids many of the limitations of
in vivo methods (e.g., lack of reciprocity and light sources that produce 5 to 20 times the intensity of the sun) and
allows the correct estimation of the attenuating power of a sunscreen drug product. The comment described this method
as recording photocurrent in 5 nm steps from 290 to 400 nm and measuring the spectral transmission of UV radiation through
a sample of Transpore
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 tape with and without sunscreen applied. Transpore
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tape is UV radiation transparent and has a rough surface that distributes sunscreen products in a way similar to the
uneven surface of the skin. Any radiation source may be used, providing there is a continuous power distribution between
290 and 400 nm. This method assesses the SPF of a product and the UVA/UVB ratio. The UVA/UVB ratio compares the reduction
of UV radiation in the UVA region with that in the UVB region of the spectrum. According to the comment, this ratio can
be used as an indicator of the UVA protection properties of a sunscreen drug product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment claimed that the method developed by Diffey and Robson (Ref. 12) has many advantages, as well as being simple,
inexpensive, and well correlated with clinical testing. The comment noted that the method does not require a biological
endpoint such as erythema, tanning, or immediate pigment darkening. The comment stated that the method provides
a basis for the classification of the UVA protection provided by a product and added that a manufacturer planned to
utilize the Diffey and Robson method to standardize the UVA claims of its products. Sunscreen products would be labeled
with one to four stars depending upon the amount of UVA protection provided by the products as determined by the Diffey
and Robson method. The comment concluded that using the ``star'' rating system for UVA claims and the SPF designation
for UVB claims provides a simple method for consumers to determine the protective nature of a sunscreen product. The
comment submitted a description of the manufacturer's methodology and ``star'' rating system (Ref. 13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment submitted data describing the application of this ratio method to the determination of the SPF and
UVA/UVB ratio of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide dispersions (Ref. 14). The comment noted that the accuracy of this
method is enhanced by good product application and that the in vitro results obtained by this method show good agreement
with in vivo values.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, another comment contended that the Diffey and Robson method (Ref. 12) has been shown to have poor correlation
with clinical results (Ref. 15). The comment stated that the Diffey and Robson method has been used as the basis for
``quantifying'' UVA protection expressed as ``stars'' on the package labeling of some sunscreen products sold in
Europe (Ref. 16). Without using an action spectrum such as the CIE UV Hazard Spectrum or the erythemal efficacy spectrum
for weighting, the ``star'' method considers all UVA wavelengths as having the same erythemal effectiveness. The
``star'' value results from an unweighted ratio of the UVA absorbance to the UVB absorbance of the product. Therefore,
the comment maintained that a low SPF product with a flat absorbance spectrum could get four ``stars'' (i.e., the highest
rating), while a higher SPF product would get fewer ``stars'' because the higher SPF product would absorb disproportionately
higher levels of UVB, similar to the action spectrum for erythema. The comment stated that the ``star'' concept is
in direct contrast to the accepted concept of formulating sunscreen drug products to provide the most protection
in the most damaging portion of the UV spectrum. The comment contended that the ``star'' method is misleading to consumers
and added that the use of the ``star'' method in England has been criticized by dermatologists, who have asked that
the system be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the agency adopt the current Standards Association of Australia (SAS) UVA (broad spectrum)
test method AS&hyph;2406 as an objective measure of UVA blocking (Ref. 17). This method measures the percent transmission
of the test sunscreen drug product between 320 and 360 nm. If an 8-micrometer layer of appropriately dissolved sunscreen
product does not transmit more than 10 percent of UV radiation at any wavelength from 320 to 360 nm inclusive, the product
may be considered as providing broad spectrum protection. The comment contended that this method has a number of advantages.
UV protection claims are most appropriately substantiated by measuring the blocking of UV directly rather than measuring
some consequence of UVA exposure. Thin film spectrophotometric evaluation of sunscreen drug products has reached
a level of technical proficiency to permit instrumental evaluation of UVA blocking potential. Adopting an already
accepted standard protocol will enhance the ability of the United States sunscreen industry to compete equally in
foreign markets. This test will substantially reduce testing costs. No human subjects are used. The comment added
that this method provides a strict criterion that serves to identify only the most effective UVA blockers. The comment
submitted several UVA scans to demonstrate that the SAS method differentiates between the ``poorly effective''
oxybenzone-containing sunscreens and an assortment of products containing ``excellent'' UVA blockers, e.g.,
titanium dioxide and avobenzone (Parsol 1789) (Ref. 17). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments contended that there are several deficiencies in the SAS method. The results are not correlated to a clinical
SPF test. Numerous studies have shown that solution and thin-film spectra are not relevant to actual product performance
on skin. The performance of the sunscreen is evaluated only in the limited range of 320 to 360 nm, rather than throughout
the entire UVA spectrum (320 to 400 nm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments recommended that the agency not adopt in vitro methods that rely on measuring the transmission of UVA
radiation through either epidermis or a UV-transparent skin cast (Refs. 18 and 19). The comments contended that these
methods are inappropriate because they use nonsolar UVA radiation sources and limited range UVA detectors or detectors
without an appropriately weighted response. The comments stated that these limitations would cause the results
to be nonrelevant to the actual responses of normal skin to full-spectrum natural sunlight. The comments mentioned
that one method (Ref. 19) contains a small but significant contamination by UVB energy below 320 nm that would adversely
affect the resulting efficacy values and lead to erroneous measures of UVA efficacy. The comments stated that the
other method (Ref. 18) skews results toward the longer UVA wavelengths because of the lamp's deficiencies in the shorter,
energy-rich UVA. The comments added that this skewing causes an overestimation of the protection of some products,
making those with ingredients that are long wavelength absorbers (such as avobenzone) look unrealistically effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment concluded that a rigorous and foolproof in vitro test method has not been established or validated. The
comment submitted two scientific publications that discuss some of the difficulties associated with in vitro sunscreen
testing techniques (Refs. 15 and 20). The comment argued that none of the current in vitro methods adequately evaluate
the photostability of sunscreens. It further stated that a validated in vivo human UVA test method must first be established.
Then, future in vitro test methods can be tested and validated against this standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments urged the agency not to adopt a testing method that utilizes photosensitizing chemicals. The comments
presented a number of arguments against this type of testing. It is considered unethical because of the carcinogenic
potential of the photosensitizing chemical (such as 8&hyph;MOP). The action spectrum (i.e., for 8&hyph;MOP induced
erythema) is artificial and inappropriate. The values obtained vary with the sensitizing chemical used and the spectrum
of the irradiating source used. The values obtained have no relevance to real-life situations. The testing may result
in a persistence of pigmentation or blistering reactions. 8&hyph;MOP sensitization exaggerates the biological
response and presents a risk of causing severe ulcerative acute reactions. 8&hyph;MOP puts subjects at risk for phototoxic
reactions for up to 6 hours after exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment contended that photosensitizing testing methods have a number of benefits, such as short irradiance
times, clearly defined endpoints, and reproducible results. The comment added that the results from these test methods
are relevant to patients taking 8&hyph;MOP or other photosensitizing drugs with similar action spectra. The comment
concluded that photosensitizing test methods could be useful to determine photoprotection factors for claims against
phototoxic reactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments urged the agency to accept the IPD testing method for determining UVA protection. One comment stated
that the IPD method is generally recognized by a substantial body of scientists as the preferred UVA testing method.
Several comments provided a number of benefits for using the IPD method. They claimed that this test method is the one
that is most representative of true conditions because it is an in vivo determination that accounts for biological
reactions that can occur on living skin. Unlike the testing procedure using skin photosensitized with 8&hyph;MOP,
the IPD test is indicative of a true broad spectrum response of normal healthy skin. Unlike erythema that is a response
only to the shorter wavelength UVA radiation, IPD is a response to broad spectrum UVA radiation. The IPD method requires
the use of considerably lower doses of radiation energy, thus exposing subjects to less risk. The IPD method uniquely
compliments the current SPF system by accurately reflecting the actual amount of long wave UVA radiation attenuated
by a sunscreen product. The IPD method is reliable, accurate, and reproducible. The IPD test can be performed in a standard
sunscreen evaluation laboratory with minimal adaptation of existing equipment. The comments concluded that until
well-established action spectra for specific UVA damage are established, IPD is the best method currently available
because it reflects broad spectrum UVA protection equally across the entire UVA spectrum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment submitted a testing protocol using IPD as the endpoint (Ref. 21). The comment stated that the suggested
testing procedure fulfilled a number of criteria. The resulting protection factor gives the consumer additional
information about the sunscreen number, complementing the SPF value. The response variable has a relatively flat
action spectrum (i.e., 320 to 400 nm, with a low peak at around 340 nm) throughout the region of interest. Using this
spectrum results in UVA protection values that closely reflect the actual amount of radiation reduced. The testing
response obeys dose reciprocity over the anticipated irradiance range. The test is practical with minimal risk to
subjects. The comment added that an eight-center clinical test has validated this method as acceptable for determining
UVA protection over the entire UVA spectrum, including long wavelength UVA (i.e., 340 to 400 nm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment submitted clinical test results from the eight test sites (Ref. 21). Each testing facility completed
between 10 and 20 subjects. Subjects with skin types III and IV were used. Four sunscreen formulations and a vehicle
control were tested. The sunscreen products contained: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 7-percent padimate O, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 2-percent oxybenzone, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 5-percent oxybenzone, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 4 percent titanium dioxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protocol used a randomized, complete block design with all subjects at each testing center receiving all five
test materials. The comment stated that the studies were conducted similar to an SPF test, but a detailed protocol
was not submitted. For example, UVA dosages and application density of the test sunscreens were not noted. Six sites
used a 150&hyph;Watt (W) Xenon lamp with 3-millimeter (mm) WG335 and 1-mm UG11 filters. One site used a 1,000&hyph;W
Xenon lamp with 3-mm WG335 and 2-mm UG11 filters. One site used a Krypton lamp (i.e., Dermlite) of unspecified wattage.
The comment noted that neither of the last two UVA sources are recommended, and the results obtained using these lamps
were included for information purposes only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IPD threshold dose of UVA radiation was first measured on unprotected skin, then on protected skin. The ratio of
these two doses was then calculated to derive the UVA Protection Factor (UVA-PF). The IPD was graded immediately after
UV exposure, allowing complete testing in a single visit.

The comment stated that comparison of test products indicated that the mean UVA-PF of the vehicle (1.7), the 7-percent
padimate O product (1.8), and the 2-percent oxybenzone product (1.8) were similar. The 5-percent oxybenzone product
(2.1) and the 4-percent titanium dioxide product (3.0) were both significantly greater than the other three products.
The titanium dioxide product was significantly greater than the 5-percent oxybenzone product. Although overall
statistical analysis detected significant site-by-product interaction, the individual results indicate that
this was primarily a quantitative interaction effect. The comment maintained that the consistency of the results
was encouraging, considering that this was the first experience in reading the IPD response for most of the participating
sites. The comment stated that these data indicate that the IPD procedure can reliably discriminate among products
that provide meaningful long wavelength UVA protection. The comment proposed using a base size of 20 subjects per
test and a 4-percent titanium dioxide product as a control to be run concurrently with each subject. The comment proposed
that the UVA-PF be the lower 95 percent confidence interval subtracted from the mean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments recommended using an IPD test based upon two recent publications (Refs. 22 and 23). One study (Ref.
22) used a Xenon lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror filtered with 1-mm WG345, 1-mm WG320, and 1-mm UG11 filters. The
exposure increments were programmed in arithmetic increments of 2 Joules per square centimeter (J/cm2). On protected
skin, the increments were 3 or 4 J/cm2. Application density of the test sunscreen products was 2 milligrams per cm2.
Visual assessment of pigmentation was done immediately after exposure and was performed on the basis of a homogenous
pigmentation with well-defined borders as endpoints. The UVA-PF is determined as the ratio of minimal IPD dose with
protection to the minimal IPD dose without protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other study (Ref. 23) recommends the use of xenon or metal halide sources, or a xenon/metal halide combination,
with continuous spectra restricted to the UVA spectrum (320 to 390 nm) with filters, such as 3-mm WG335 and 1-mm UG5.
Six UVA doses ranging from 4 to about 30 J/cm2 are applied in 50 percent increments to subjects with skin types II, III,
and IV. The study states that with potential free interpolation, this is actually a 25-percent progression. The doses
applied on the protected skin are multiplied by the expected UVA-PF of the product under test. Observation of the responses
are delayed for at least 1 hour, and typically 2 hours, after exposure. The study states that results are less variable
if read at 2 hours. A simultaneous determination of the minimal IPD doses on protected and unprotected skin is done
at the same time in standard room and illumination conditions. Other parameters concerning the test area, size of
test sites, product application density, selection of volunteers, etc. follow the same current standards as for
the SPF determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments objected to the use of the IPD testing method. One comment stated that the action spectrum for the
IPD response is flat and quite dissimilar from the action spectrum for damage to the skin from ultraviolet light for
erythema, skin cancer, or photoaging of the skin. The comment contended that the IPD response has not been demonstrated
to be a direct or surrogate endpoint for biological damage and, therefore, there is no relationship between a product's
ability to prevent IPD and to prevent damage to the skin. The comment added that IPD has been shown to be unstable, variable,
and nonlinear. Another comment stated that the IPD reaction shows nonreciprocal behavior, i.e., the severity of
the reaction depends upon the time taken to deliver a certain dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that there are two methods of assessing UVA protection that are referred to as IPD. The comment stated
that these two methods differ in the amount of energy needed to produce a response and the time after irradiation at
which the endpoint is read. In one method, the response is read at 45 seconds after exposure. This response is transient
and has been shown to be highly variable and nonreproducible. The response is oxygen-dependent and can only be elicited
in darker skin types. In the second method, the response is read at 2 to 4 hours after exposure and uses a much higher dose
of UVA. The test causes a persistent pigment response in the skin that may last up to several hours. The comment maintained
that the action spectrum for the persistent pigment endpoint has been neither determined nor published.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment argued that the threshold problem of not having a truly solar UVA-only light source further complicates
the results obtained using either IPD method. The comment contended that even filtered Xenon lamps contain significant
amounts of visible radiation which, while not harmful to the skin, may cause the IPD reaction to occur. The comment
pointed out that a sunscreen's ability to block visible light should not be confused or combined with its ability to
provide UVA protection. In addition, the comment argued that the light sources used for both IPD methods lack significant
energy in the shorter UVA wavelengths, which are present in sunlight and which are responsible for the preponderance
of UVA damage to the skin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stating that there is great demand among the ``sunbather'' population for a ``great looking'' tan and for an indicator
to predict how good a tan can be obtained with a product, one comment argued that tanning tests like the IPD are not appropriate
for measurement of the damage caused by UVA radiation. The comment contended that measures of melanogenesis would
be misinterpreted by consumers as indicators of efficacy of tanning and that consumers would soon be choosing products
with the lowest IPD rating to help get the deepest tan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the agency adopt the Protection Factor in UVA (PFA) test method (Refs. 24, 25, and 26).
This method is similar to the SPF testing procedures with a modification to the light source to virtually eliminate
UVB radiation and thus expose subjects to UVA radiation (greater than 99 percent). The PFA test uses subjects with
skin types I, II, and III. The UVA source is a continuous UVA spectrum (preferably xenon arc) filtered with a 3-mm Schott
WG335 filter that eliminates 99 percent of the UVB radiation, with less than 1,500 W per square meter (W/m2) irradiance.
UVA exposures are delivered at 25-percent increments to skin above and below the expected UVA protection level of
the sunscreen product times the minimal response dose. The endpoints measured in this testing method are delayed
erythema or tanning, whichever is present, observed 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The comment stated that these
acute responses have similar action spectra to the chronic action spectra for nonmelanoma skin cancer (as determined
in animals), solar elastosis, and skin wrinkling. The comment added that the data indicate equivalent results with
either response parameter. Minimal response doses are elicited with UVA exposure ranging from approximately 80
to 250 J/cm2. The PFA is the ratio of the minimal response dose on protected skin to the minimal response dose on unprotected
skin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment submitted the results of a multicenter evaluation of sunscreens using PFA methodology (Ref. 25). Sunscreens
containing 2 or 5 percent oxybenzone, 7 percent padimate O, and a placebo were tested in five laboratories using a PFA
protocol. All the solar simulators had intrinsic UV reflecting/IR absorbing dichroic mirrors and were fitted with
Schott 3-mm WG335 and 1-mm UG11 filters. The comment stated that the PFA test method yielded reproducible results
between test centers and was capable of distinguishing between the three levels of UVA protection provided by the
placebo sunscreen and the sunscreens containing 2- or 5-percent oxybenzone. The test was incapable of distinguishing
between the UVA protection provided by the placebo and the 7-percent padimate O (a strong UVB absorber with little
UVA absorbency). The comment stated that these results indicate that the PFA test method is not influenced by the presence
of a strong UVB blocker in the formulation and is specific in identifying UVA protection. The comment added that the
data show that the level of irradiance of the light sources (i.e., 300 to 1,200 W/m2) did not influence the protection
factors of the sunscreens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that testing procedures using modified lamps that produce mostly UVA wavelengths are unsatisfactory
for evaluating the UVA protection afforded by a sunscreen drug product because the filters required for such testing
can remove 40 percent or more of the critical, damaging wavelengths between 320 and 340 nm. In addition, the comments
pointed out that some of these modified lamps contain UVB wavelengths below 320 nm that can overwhelm UVA effects.
However, another comment stated that PFA values obtained using modified lamps and delayed tanning or erythema as
endpoints weigh the UVA II (320 to 340 nm) heavily and, for the most part, ignore the contribution of the longer UVA wavelengths
(360 to 400 nm). One comment stated that failure of reciprocity may occur with very long exposures and that making each
test exactly the same for each differently configured UV source used and its particular energy distribution would
be impossible. Another comment stated that dose reciprocity for the endpoints of delayed tanning or erythema has
been reported to fail at irradiances between 10 and 50 milliwatts per cm

 and below. One comment noted that the interval after exposure at which the responses are evaluated can bias the results.
The comment added that the infrared energy or heat delivered to the skin during these exposures can affect and alter
the results.

The comment stated that no currently existing lamps accurately and fully reproduce the UVA spectrum of sunlight.
Pure UVA I lamps, e.g., the UVASUN series, are used primarily for photochemotherapy where only longer wave UVA (above
340 nm) is wanted. Xenon arc lamps modified with a WG345 filter are deficient in UVA energy below 335 nm and do not accurately
reflect the energies or damage risk of natural sunlight UVA. According to the comment, such lamps remove too much of
the energy at the short end of the spectrum and result in overestimating the UVA effectiveness of sunscreens. Xenon
arc lamps filtered with 1- or 2-mm WG335 filters contain UVB wavelengths below 320 nm and thus can greatly affect test
results. Thicker WG335 filters cut off too much lower UVA energy to accurately represent UVA risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment submitted a method that assesses the attenuation of the incident solar radiation on human skin by a sunscreen
(Ref. 27). This method utilizes the principles of diffuse reflectance and fluorescence excitation spectroscopy.
The method directly measures the optical properties of the skin decoupled from its biological responses. Both procedures
are based on the same principle, any modification of the surface of the skin will produce changes in its absorption
properties. Application of a sunscreen modifies the surface of the skin by providing an additional barrier through
which solar radiation must penetrate before reaching the skin. Measurement of the absorption properties of the skin
before and after sunscreen application yields the transmission spectrum of the product and permits calculation
of it solar protection value for the wavelength range investigated. The comment stated that, because this method
allows repetitive testing, evaluations of substantivity and water resistance are possible. The comment contended
that, because the testing is done on human skin, questions of binding, distribution, and photodegradation can be
answered. In addition, the comment maintained that this testing procedure, like the Diffey and Robson method (Ref.
12), does not suffer from a lack of dose reciprocity, as observed with UVA-induced acute skin reactions. The comment
concluded that this procedure allows for the correct estimation of the attenuating power of a sunscreen; thus, the
protection potential of products in sunlight will be correctly estimated.

The agency would like to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various recommended testing procedures
and the following specific questions regarding these test methods at the meeting: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Which of the in vitro test methods described above would be adequate to evaluate the UVA protection provided by a
sunscreen drug product? Why would the others not be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are the results of in vitro UVA testing methods relevant to the UVA protection provided to consumers by a sunscreen
drug product during normal use? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the APP test method demonstrate whether a sunscreen drug product provides meaningful protection against
harmful UVA radiation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Do the data show that the APP test does not overestimate the actual amount of UVA radiation blocked by most sunscreen
drug products? Identify the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Describe the specifications for an appropriate light source for the IPD testing method, e.g., spectral distribution,
intensity, etc.

6. What UVA radiation doses are appropriate for use in the IPD test? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. When should the IPD response be read_immediately, or 1 or 2 hours after UVA exposure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Is the IPD reaction relevant to protection of the skin from UVA damage? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Do the available data demonstrate that the IPD test is stable, nonvariable, and reproducible? Identify the data.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Do the available data demonstrate that the IPD testing response obeys dose reciprocity over the anticipated irradiance
range? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Are results of the PFA testing procedure relevant to protection of the skin from UVA damage? Identify the results.

13. Can the interval after exposure at which PFA responses are read affect the results? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Does the heat or infrared energy delivered to the skin during PFA testing exposure affect the results? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Describe the specifications for an appropriate light source for the PFA testing method, e.g., spectral distribution,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has concluded, under 21 CFR 10.65, that it would be in the public interest to hold a public meeting to discuss
the many questions and topics associated with UVA testing for OTC sunscreen drug products. The proposed rulemaking
involves 21 CFR parts 352, 700, and 740; however, the discussion at the public meeting will be limited to part 352. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests information regarding UVA protection claims and UVA testing procedures from any interested
person. However, the agency requests that only new or additional information not previously included in the rulemaking
be submitted. Data should be specifically limited and relevant to the questions asked. Any individual or group may,
on or before April 29, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above), comments and data relevant to
the questions and topics on UVA protection and testing procedures contained in this document. Two copies of any comments
are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. All comments are to be identified with the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. It is not necessary to resubmit data and information submitted
previously to this docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any individual or group interested in making a presentation at the meeting should contact Jeanne Rippere (address
above). Presentations should only address the questions and topics listed previously. Persons interested in participating
in the meeting must also send a notice of participation on or before April 29, 1994, to the Dockets Management Branch
(address above). All notices of participation submitted should be identified with the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document and should contain the following information: Name, address, telephone number, business
affiliation, if any, of the person desiring to make a presentation, summary of the presentation, and the approximate
amount of time requested for the presentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Groups having similar interests are requested to consolidate their comments and present them through a single representative.
Depending on the time available and the number of participants, FDA may require joint presentations by persons with
common interests. After reviewing the notices of participation, FDA will notify each participant of the schedule
and time allotted to each person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative record for the OTC sunscreen drug products rulemaking is being reopened to specifically include
only the proceedings of this public meeting. The administrative record will remain open until July 31, 1994, to allow
comments on matters raised at the meeting.
