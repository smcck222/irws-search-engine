<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined
that it is a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined
that this action: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not materially alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866.

The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule and related notice(s) to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983), this Program
is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and
local officials.

This final rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this final rule
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare agencies
will be the most affected to the extent that they may be required to modify application forms, add telephone access
information to their forms, and modify their verification procedures, however the effect on these entities will
be minimal. Participants and applicants will be affected by changes to the application and to procedures in reporting
medical expenses.

The reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the certification and continued eligibility of food stamp
households is approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 0584&hyph;0064.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The food stamp application, as approved under this OMB number, already contains several important verification
statements to the household. The requirement in 7 CFR 273.2(c)(5) that State agencies develop a separate written
general ``Notice of Verification'' versus including such information on the food stamp application or verbally
conveying such information to households does not alter or change the methodologies used to determine the burden
estimates approved under OMB control No. 0584&hyph;0064.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in 7 CFR 272.2(a), 272.4(d), and 272.5 relative to the submission and updating of an optional ``Program
information activities planning document'' as part of a State agency's Plan of Operation have been submitted to OMB
and have been approved under OMB approval number 0584&hyph;0083. This rule amends the table at 7 CFR 271.8 ``Information
collection/recordkeeping_OMB assigned control numbers'' to reflect the OMB control number for the approval of
burden associated with 7 CFR 272.5 of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining provisions of this rule do not contain any reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements subject to
approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local law, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``effective date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program, the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_State
administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities);
(3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at
7 CFR 278.8.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1989 the Department published an interim rulemaking at 54 FR 24518, which implemented several of the food
stamp provisions contained in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435). Comments were solicited
on the provisions of the interim rulemaking through August 7, 1989. The Department received 13 comment letters from
State and local welfare agencies and public interest groups. All comments received were reviewed and considered
but comments which were unclear or not pertinent to this rulemaking are not addressed in this preamble. For a full understanding
of the provisions of this final rule, the reader should refer to the preamble of the interim rule. The provisions of
the interim rule addressing specified procedures for claiming the medical deduction are not being finalized in this
rule. Those provisions will be addressed in a forthcoming proposed rule entitled Simplification of Program Rules.
Also, the provision of the interim rule addressing the delivery of benefits to households which apply after the fifteenth
of the month is not finalized in this rule but will be placed in final form in the forthcoming Benefit Delivery final
rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Elderly or Disabled_7 CFR 271.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 350 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 added three categories to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of elderly or disabled persons. These categories are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients of interim assistance benefits pending the receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of supplemental security income (SSI); (2) recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability-related medical assistance benefits under title XIX of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Social Security Act (SSA); and (3) recipients of disability-based State general assistance benefits. Recipients
of any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these benefits must be treated as disabled persons for food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes provided the eligibility to receive these benefits is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon disability or blindness criteria which are at least as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent as those under title XVI of the SSA. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended paragraph (11) of the definition of ``Elderly or disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member'' in 7 CFR 271.2 in the interim rulemaking to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received several comments suggesting changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule language. One commenter stated that it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unclear in the rule language that receipt of interim assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is involved in only the first of the three new categories of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled member. The Department shares the commenter's concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is amending paragraph (11) of the definition of ``Elderly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled member'' in 7 CFR 271.2 in this rulemaking to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly indicate that receipt of interim assistance as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of being defined as disabled for food stamp purposes is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only required for those persons who are interim recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that it is unclear in the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language if it is only disability-based State general assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(GA) that must be based upon disability or blindness criteria at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least as stringent as title XVI of the SSA, or whether the ``at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least as stringent'' requirement applies to all three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. The Department interprets the law to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``at least as stringent'' criteria apply to all three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. The regulatory language at 7 CFR 271.2 is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to clarify this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter pointed out that the definition of elderly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled persons in 7 CFR 271.2 needs to be revised to clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that it is State programs, not individual cases, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be measured by the ``at least as stringent criteria as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title XVI of the Social Security Act'' requirement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter argued that the regulation, as it is written in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule, appears to state that the decision as to whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GA program is based on criteria as stringent as those under title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
XVI of the Social Security Act can be made on a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. The commenter argued, however, that the intent of Public Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100&hyph;435 was for this decision to be made on a State-by-State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, not case-by-case. The Department agrees with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter and is amending paragraph (11) of the definition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to further emphasize that State disability programs will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be measured by criteria at least as stringent as those under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title XVI, the Department has decided to further amend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``Elderly or disabled member'' in this final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in paragraph (11) of the definition the specific citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the SSA regulations interpreting title XVI of the SSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including this citation will provide State and local agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the information necessary to determine if an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for food stamps meets the definition of elderly/disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person as set forth in the Food Stamp Act.

Training_7 CFR 272.4(d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 322(a) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 amended section 11(e)(6)(C) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(6)(C)) to specifically require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training for case workers provided by the State agency convey the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals of and methods for promptly and accurately certifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible households. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
272.4(d)(1)(i) to reflect this statutory language. A commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not think it was necessary for the Department to instruct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies to include this ``function'' of the Program in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs. As the Department explained in the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the interim rule, this language was added to the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to emphasize Congressional concern in this area as reflected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;435. The Department is adopting the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(1)(i) as final without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, pursuant to section 322(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule added a new paragraph (d)(2) to 7 CFR 272.4 to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies, at their option, to offer training and assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to persons working with certain volunteer or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations. In conjunction with this new option, the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule added a new paragraph (f) to 7 CFR 277.4 to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses (e.g., travel costs, lodging, or meals) of the persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working with the volunteer or nonprofit organization who receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this training and assistance would not be reimbursed. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter was concerned that the interim rule language appearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 7 CFR 277.4(f) could be misinterpreted to mean that travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses of State employees who work with organizations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive this training would not be allowable. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees that the language could create this misinterpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this final rule amends the interim provisions at 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 277.4(f) to clarify this distinction. The interim provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(2) is adopted as final without change.

Information for Low-Income Households_7 CFR 272.5(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 204(a) and (b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and 7 CFR 272.5(c) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule allow State agencies, at their option, to inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households about the availability, eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, application procedures and benefits of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Program. Pursuant to section 204(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule also amended 7 CFR 272.5(c) to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies, at their option, may request reimbursement under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR part 277 for these outreach activities. The interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained a number of conforming amendments necessitated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of these outreach activity provisions. 7 CFR 272.5(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was amended to specify that if a State agency elects to request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement for Program informational materials directed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households, those materials must meet any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilingual requirements. 7 CFR 272.5(c) was further amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that prior to claiming such outreach costs, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must receive approval from the Food and Nutrition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service (FNS) of an appropriate amendment to their State Plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations. In addition, 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) was amended to add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the optional ``Program informational activities plan'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a component of the State Plan of Operation, and 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
272.2(d)(1) was amended to add the requirement that State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies submit the optional ``Program informational activity'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning document to FNS for inclusion in their State Plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation. Lastly, the interim rule added a conforming amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 7 CFR part 277, appendix A, to remove paragraph C(14) which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made obsolete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt the requirement of 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates that State agencies submit a Program informational

activities plan is burdensome. The commenter suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budget justification contained on the form FNS&hyph;366A should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to obtain the prediction of expenditures. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department disagrees. As State agencies begin to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outreach under Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department wishes to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sure that controls are in place that ensure cost-effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spending. The plans provide important information on the kinds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of activities and services being planned as well as the sub-populations at which State agencies are targeting their
efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having this information and the budget projection data will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the Department to assist State agencies in developing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most cost-effective outreach programs possible. Therefore, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule adopts the interim provisions pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for low income households as final without change.

Waiver of the In-Office Interview_7 CFR 273.2(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 330 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(e) to explicitly specify
the circumstances under which the in-office interview for an applicant household must be waived. Consequently,
current rules at 7 CFR 273.2(e) require that in-office interviews be waived if requested by households which are unable
to send a household member to the food stamp office because they: (1) Are elderly or disabled as defined in 7 CFR 271.2;
(2) live in a location which is not served by a certification office; (3) are experiencing transportation difficulties
as determined by the State agency on a case-by-case basis; or (4) are experiencing other hardships that the State agency
determines warrants a waiver of the in-office interview such as illness, care of a household member, hardships due
to residing in a rural area, prolonged severe weather or work hours. If the in-office interview is waived, the State
agency has the option to conduct a telephone interview or a home visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received one comment criticizing the interim rule provision, stating that the provision made ``the
obvious and thoroughly unnecessary statement that granting waivers to in-office interviews applied in rural areas''.
The commenter felt that adding emphasis to the regulations is not a decisive way to act when the Program has operational
problems. Furthermore, the commenter felt that problems State agencies may have in applying the requirement to grant
waivers of in-office interviews should be dealt with by FNS regional office staff. The Department understands the
commenter's concerns, but the language in the interim rule was not added to address operational concerns, but rather
was required by law. Public Law 100&hyph;435 clearly states that waiving in-office interviews for households in
rural areas is sometimes necessary, and State agencies must do so when a household meets specific criteria. The interim
rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(e) specifically to address Congressional concern that residency in a rural area not be a barrier
to participation in the Food Stamp Program. Therefore this action adopts the interim provisions at 7 CFR 273.2(e)
as final without change.

The Food Stamp Application Form_7 CFR 273.2(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the
regulations pertaining to the food stamp application form. Prior to publication of the interim rule, the regulations
at 7 CFR 273.2(b) permitted State agencies to deviate from the FNS-designed food stamp application in order to process
joint applications with other assistance programs, meet the requirements of a State agency computer system or accommodate
State agency needs that are determined to be justifiable. The first provision of section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435
amended section 11(e)(2) of the Food Stamp Act to mandate that, in addition to its current criteria for approving State
agency application forms, FNS must also ensure that the application is brief. Accordingly, the June 7, 1989 interim
rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b) to include brevity as a condition for approving deviations from the FNS food stamp application
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments received about the food stamp application form concerned this provision. Commenters, while
supporting the interim rule's intent to shorten the food stamp application, wondered how the Department intends
to judge whether an application form is ``brief'' enough to meet the requirements of Public Law 100&hyph;435. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397 (p. 24) expressed Congressional dismay over the length of multi-program application
forms, i.e. application forms for food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits. The Department
concurs with Congress on this issue. The purpose of an application form is to obtain basic eligibility information
from the client (such as name, address, income, expenses, etc.). Such information requires only a few pages of questions
for applicant households to complete. The Department also understands, however, that limiting the length of applications
can be a problem for State agencies trying to administer a variety of programs. In December 1990, the Department completed
a review of all State-designed application forms. The review had been initiated because of the passage of Public Law
100&hyph;435 and the ongoing concern that the food stamp application not be a barrier to participation in the Program.
The reviewers found length to be the most disturbing problem with State-designed multi-program application forms.
The length of the forms ranged from 3 to 44 pages, and the number of programs covered by the forms ranged from 3 to 9. Of
the multi-program applications reviewed, 8 forms were 1&hyph;10 pages long, 21 were 11&hyph;20 pages, 7 were 21&hyph;30
pages, and 12 forms were over 30 pages long. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department realizes that the length of application forms is due to a great extent to such demands as automation
and the need to administer a variety of programs. The Food Stamp Act, however, requires the Department to ensure that
application forms are easy to use, readable, brief and written in simple terms. Therefore, the Department, in reviewing
State agency applications, attempts to balance the need to reduce the burden on applicants and each State agency's
need to administer the many programs under its jurisdiction. The Department is making no changes to the interim provision
and is adopting that provision as final.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second provision of section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 requires that the Department, in consultation with
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provide guidance to those State agencies requesting assistance
in the development of brief, simply-written application forms, including forms that allow for simultaneous application
to participate in the Food Stamp, AFDC, and Medicaid Programs. Accordingly, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended
7 CFR 273.2(b) to advise State agencies of their option to request assistance from FNS when developing their applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the Department reevaluate the FNS application form and work with the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) to design a simpler, shorter form to be used for all assistance programs. The Department has
completed drafting a revised version of the FNS Food Stamp Application Form (FNS Form 385), which is available to State
agencies. The Department believes, however, that since many public assistance programs are administered by State
agencies and funded by a combination of Federal and State monies, State agencies are better able to design a short,
multi-program application form that will enhance the administration of their public assistance programs while
lessening barriers to participation for food stamp applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter objected that there is no clear procedure to request assistance from FNS in developing a new application
form. The Department disagrees. In the preamble to the June 7, 1989 interim rule (54 FR 24521), the Department describes
the procedure necessary to request assistance. The procedure, which has not changed, is for State agencies to request
assistance through the Deputy Administrator for the Food Stamp Program. The Deputy administrator, or the Deputy
Administrator's designee, would be responsible for overseeing the review of an application form by FNS officials
at the Regional level and would coordinate the review of the application with HHS. Regional officials will be responsible
for coordinating between the State agency and the National office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 also requires that all applications for food stamp benefits contain certain
statements on the front cover which advise the household of important information about the application process.
These required statements include: (1) A place on the front cover where applicants can write their names, addresses,
and signatures; (2) instructions that advise the households of their right to file the application without finishing
all parts; (3) a statement describing the expedited service procedures; and (4) a statement that informs the household
that benefits are provided only from the date of application. Accordingly, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)
to require that the food stamp application form contain the above information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to publication of the interim rule, section 1736 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief
Act, Title XVII, Public Law 101&hyph;624, 104 Stat. 3359, enacted November 28, 1990 (hereafter referred to as the
Leland Act) amended section 11(e) of the Food Stamp Act to require that certain information previously mandated to
be displayed on the front cover of the application form must now be placed ``on or near'' the front page of the application
form. There must continue to appear on the front page of the application a place where applicants can write their names,
addresses, and signatures. However, the instructions that advise the households of their right to file the application
without finishing all parts, the statement describing the expedited service procedures, and the statement that
informs the household that benefits are provided only from the date of application must now appear ``on or near'' the
front page. The Department implemented this provision in a final regulation implementing categorical eligibility
and application provisions of the Leland Act, published at 56 FR 63611 on December 4, 1991, which amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(v),
(b)(1)(vi), and (b)(1)(vii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes mandated by the Leland Act and implemented in the final rule published on December 4, 1991 have superseded
the provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435 pertaining to mandatory information appearing on the front page of the
application form. For this reason, the Department is not addressing any comments which discuss this provision of
Public Law 100&hyph;435. Individuals with any questions about this provision should refer to the December 4, 1991
final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule mandate that households be informed on the application
of their right to file for food stamp benefits with only their name, address and signature. This is reflected in 7 CFR
273.2(b)(1)(iv) of the interim rule. A commenter felt this requirement did not consider the impact on on-line application
systems which satisfy the intent of this provision in a more sophisticated manner. Usually, an on-line application
system does not require applicants to complete any handwritten information on an application form. The eligibility
worker completes the on-line application at the certification interview. When an applicant is unable to complete
the on-line application process, usually some sort of ``Intent to Apply'' application form is submitted to protect
the filing date. The applicant then returns to complete the on-line application process at a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe the interim rule conflicts with any on-line system presently in operation. In the
final rulemaking implementing categorical eligibility and application provisions of the Leland Act, published
at 56 FR 63611 on December 4, 1991, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)(3) to give FNS authority to review and approve
deviations from the FNS-designed application form, including the use of on-line application forms. The Department
believes this oversight authority will ensure that on-line application forms contain the mandatory information
required by law. The Department is therefore adopting the interim provision in 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(iv) as final without
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also received a general comment which recommended the final rule specifically indicate when the term
``applications'' refers to the applicant's initial request for certification only, and when it refers to recertification.
For food stamp purposes, the Department does not differentiate between certification and recertification. In both
situations, a household must complete and submit a food stamp application form, provide verification of information
and participate in an interview with an eligibility worker. Therefore, the term ``applications'' in the interim
rule and in this final rule refers to both initial certification and subsequent recertifications. The Department
is, however, considering differentiating between initial certification and subsequent recertification. The
Department is currently developing a proposed rule to consider means to simplify program requirements, including
simplifying recertification procedures. In that rule, the Department may propose introducing differences in processing
initial applications for certification and applications for recertification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 352 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 reinstated joint application practices that were previously required under
the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as originally enacted, but subsequently were made optional by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;253, 96 Stat. 763, Sept. 8, 1982). Accordingly, the interim rule, published June 7, 1989,
amended 7 CFR 273.2 (j) and (j)(1)(i) to require State agencies to join the application for food stamps with the application
for public assistance (PA) and general assistance (GA) and to notify AFDC applicants of their right to file a joint
application. The interim rule also amended 7 CFR 273.2(j)(1) to add a new paragraph (j)(1)(v) which specified that
households whose PA/GA eligibility was terminated shall not be required to file a new application, but shall have
their food stamp eligibility and benefits determined by available information from the PA/GA casefile provided
the information is sufficient for food stamp purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the mandate for joint processing of applications were nearly evenly split between opponents and proponents.
One commenter recommended the final rule mandate development of a single, universal application for all needs-based
assistance programs. Another commenter focused on the issue of whether the interim rule exceeded the legislative
intent of section 352 by requiring a single ``application'' for both food stamps and AFDC when only a single ``interview''
is necessary. The commenter felt the interim rule should be amended to mandate only a joint interview for food stamp/AFDC
applicants, not a joint application. Another commenter disagreed with the requirement to include the application
for food stamps in the application for GA benefits because GA is a State-run program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the first comment recommending the development of a single, universal application, the Department has
found that many State agencies have already developed ``multi-program'' forms, i.e., one form is used for food stamps,
PA and GA, and medical assistance. The Department feels State agencies are in a better position to design application
forms that enhance the administration of their benefit assistance programs. For this reason, the Department believes
mandating a single, universal application form is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department disagrees with the premise of the second comment, which stated that the interim rule exceeded legislative
intent by mandating a joint application for both food stamps and AFDC rather than just a joint interview. Section 11(i)
of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(i)), as amended by section 352 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, requires that households
in which all members are included in a federally aided public assistance grant (such as AFDC) have their application
for food stamps contained in the public assistance application form. The Department believes the law is clear in requiring
a joint application for food stamps and PA (as used here, PA is defined at 7 CFR 271.2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to the third comment, legislation passed subsequent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;435 further defined the requirements regarding joint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for GA and food stamps. Section 1740 of the Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act modified the combined application form requirement in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11(i)(3) of the Food Stamp Act to require a combined GA and food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stamp application form only in States that have a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide GA application form. The Department implemented this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in the December 4, 1991, final rule (56 FR 63597) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented the categorical eligibility and application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Leland Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth commenter recommended that the Department withhold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of joint applications which require clients to answer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions irrelevant to the Food Stamp Program if they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for food stamps only. The commenter felt that clients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be informed that answers to those questions are optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that any joint application must be clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to afford applicants the option of answering only those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions relevant to the program or programs for which they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying. The Department is amending the regulatory language at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 311 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 7, 1989, implemented five provisions pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of application information supplied by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household. The interim provisions required that State agencies: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide all applicant households with a clear written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement explaining what the household must do to cooperate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining verification and completing the application; (2) assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each applicant household in obtaining verification and completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application process; (3) not require households to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple sources of verification when the household has already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided verification which adequately supports statements on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application (although a State agency may require households to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide additional verification when the State agency determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that existing verification is incomplete, inaccurate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent); (4) not deny an application solely because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person outside of the household (who is not a person outside of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household because of a specific disqualification action or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ineligible status) fails to cooperate with the State agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of the application; and (5) process applications, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household cooperates by providing information, by taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate steps to verify information otherwise required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified under the Food Stamp Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that clarification is needed regarding whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State agency must provide applicants with a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification statement or a specific verification statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tailored to each applicant household (7 CFR 273.2(c)(5)). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes the preamble to the interim rule was quite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear in encouraging State agencies to develop a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that could be given to all applicant households, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a written statement which would need to be tailored to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the interim rule provided guidelines that must be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the general verification notice, the Department wishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promote greater conformity among State agency-designed notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that applicant households are consistently informed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary documents needed for verification of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(c)(5) to add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that the State agency, at a minimum, include in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general verification notice examples of the types of documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household should provide and an explanation of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the documents should cover.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter correctly pointed out that the preamble of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule was incorrect in stating that current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that social security numbers must be verified prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying any applicant household for benefits. Current rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;273.2(f)(1)(v) state that the State agency shall not delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible household solely to verify the social security number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SSN) of a household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter correctly identified an inconsistency in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim regulation language at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(i)(A) with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the requirement for verification where the source of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's income has changed. The first sentence of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section correctly states that ``the State agency shall verify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in income or actual expenses if the source has changed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount has changed by more than $25.'' The final sentence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertently omits the requirement for verification anytime the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of income changes, even if the amount has changed by $25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or less. The same inconsistency exists at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(i)(A) and (ii) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct the inconsistencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter criticized the interim rule's interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 311(D) of Public Law 100&hyph;435. Section 311(D) provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State agency may not deny any application for participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely because of the failure of a person outside of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household to cooperate with a request for providing verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision would not apply when the person refusing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperate would otherwise be a household member but for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of any of the individual disqualification provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of section 6 of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Act. These subsections require disqualification for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person intentionally making a false or misleading statement or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committing any act which violates the Food Stamp Act (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(b)); any non-exempt person who is physically and mentally fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is between the ages of 16 and 60 who refuses to register to

work (section 6(d)); any person who is a student enrolled at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least half-time in an institution of higher education (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e)); any person who is not a resident of the United States, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not either a citizen or a lawful alien (section 6(f)); and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who receives SSI benefits in a ``cash-out'' State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(section 6(g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When amending 7 CFR 273.2(d)(1) to incorporate the mandate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 311(D) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department added two more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories to the list of persons outside the household who cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial of an application for participation if they fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperate with a request for providing verification. These two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new categories were: Individuals disqualified for failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an SSN, and persons who fail to attest to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizenship or alien status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter who criticized this provision felt that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department had exceeded its authority in excluding two new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of non-household members from the third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters correctly point out that the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broadened the third party verification rule to include two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional categories of persons who will cause the denial of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to participate if they failed to cooperate with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request to provide verification. This was done to make this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision consistent with other provisions in the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where ineligible or disqualified persons are, in effect, deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by program regulations to be a household member for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining eligibility and benefit levels. FNS believes this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate as it is consistent with the desire to simplify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements that was expressed by Congress in adopting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Hunger Prevention Act (See, e.g., Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p.25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule also amended verification standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households subject to monthly reporting and retrospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting (MRRB) at 7 CFR 273.21(i) (1) and (3). Those provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not being finalized in this final rule, however, because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been superseded by amendments made in the final rule on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes, published on December 4, 1991, at 56 FR 63597. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals with questions about verification standards for MRRB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households should refer to this December 4, 1991 final rule.

Demonstration Projects/Cash-Outs in Other Benefit Programs_7

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 340 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule amended 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to specify that in-kind or vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments which would normally be excluded as income but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converted in whole, or in part, to a direct cash payment under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approval of a federally authorized demonstration project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall continue to be excluded from income. These federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized demonstration projects include demonstration projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
created by waiver of the provisions of Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, conversion to direct cash payment does not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-deductibility of the expenses paid with these funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in order to ensure that an excluded vendor payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been converted to a direct cash payment is not excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twice (once as income and once as expenses) the interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to specify that an expense covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an excluded vendor payment which has been converted to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct cash payment under the approval of a federally authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration project remains non-deductible as a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received no comments regarding these provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule. Therefore, this action adopts the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions as final with no changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 323 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies are required to provide a household, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification and recertification, with a statement describing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's reporting responsibilities. Moreover, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must provide all households with a toll-free telephone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number or a number where collect calls will be accepted in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the household to reach an appropriate representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically require that the ``change report'' form include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement describing the household's reporting responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) was amended to specify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``change report'' form must contain the number of the food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
office and a toll-free number or a number where collect calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be accepted. (Reporting requirements remained unchanged for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households subject to MRRB provisions of 7 CFR 273.21.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule also amended the provisions relative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Eligibility, the Notice of Denial, the Notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adverse Action, and the requirements for bilingual notices. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 7 CFR 272.4(b)(3)(ii)(B), 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.10(g)(1)(i)(A), 7 CFR 273.10(g)(1)(ii) and 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.13(a)(2), respectively, were amended to specify that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices must also include either a toll-free number or a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where collect calls will be accepted for households living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside the local calling area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received one comment on these provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule. The commenter pointed out that the legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent of the toll-free or collect telephone number was to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase households' access to the State agency in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain information or report changes. The commenter felt this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of purpose should be incorporated into the rule itself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to help guide State agencies' implementation efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes including a statement of purpose in 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.12(b) is unnecessary. Congress was clear that its intent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passing the Hunger Prevention Act was to make it easier for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible households to apply and obtain benefits (Senate Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 100&hyph;397, p.25). On its face, the implementation of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision demonstrates its purpose without additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanation. The interim provisions are adopted as final without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to two provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Program regulations to extend eligibility to farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households which are in need of program assistance. Section 341 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Public Law 100&hyph;435 specified that self-employed farm households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are subject to MRRB have the option to annualize their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-employment income and expenses over a 12-month period. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was implemented in the interim rule by amending 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.21(f)(2)(i) and 273.11.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 342 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 affected farm households which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quit farming. Accordingly, 7 CFR 273.8(e)(5) was amended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule to specify that property essential to self- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment of a household member engaged in farming is excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a resource for one year from the date the household member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates self-employment from farming. A conforming amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1)(i) specified that any licensed vehicle which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been used over 50 percent of the time in the self-employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a household member engaged in farming continues to be excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a resource for one year from the date the household member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates his/her self-employment from farming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received only one comment on the interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which supported the one-year extension of the above exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this action adopts the interim provisions as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without change.

Under the interim rule, the provisions addressed in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule were retroactively implemented effective July 1, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received several comments complaining about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short implementation time for the interim rule. While we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sympathize about the short lead time given to State agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the interim rule, the Department had no discretion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this matter and had to implement the time frames mandated by Public Law 100&hyph;435. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this final action which adopt as final without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change provisions of the interim rule or modify a provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule for clarity only are retroactively effective to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1989. The clarifications do not represent any change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy and, thus, do not require any special implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts by State agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this final action which require the alteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of State procedures, are to be effective May 6, 1994. State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must complete implementation efforts of new provisions no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than September 5, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any variance resulting from the implementation of the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment shall be excluded from quality control error

The provisions of this final rule

that amend 7 CFR 273.2(b)(3), 273.2(c)(5), 273.2(f)(8) (i)(A) and

(ii), and paragraph (11) of the ``Elderly or disabled member'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition in 7 CFR 271.2 are effective as of May 6, 1994. The State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall implement the provisions not later than September 5, 1994 for all households newly applying for Program benefits
on or after such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation date. The current caseload shall be converted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions at household request, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recertification, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs first, and the State agency must provide restored benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back to the required implementation date. If for any reason a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency fails to implement on the required implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, restored benefits shall be provided, if appropriate, back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the required implementation date or the date of application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is later. Any variances resulting from implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the provisions of this amendment shall be excluded from error

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) has revised and reissued its Rules Regarding Equal
Opportunity (Rules) to conform those Rules as closely as possible to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's

Opportunity'', which became effective October 1, 1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These Rules are hereby issued as a final rule. The Board issued these Rules as an interim rule, with request for public
comments, on February 18, 1993. This final rule deviates from the interim rule in only a few particulars, based upon
recommendations received from the Commission and from interested members of the Board's staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to laws respecting discrimination in employment, the Board as a matter of policy has long recognized that
it should afford to its employees, applicants for employment, and others the same substantive and procedural rights
that are enjoyed by persons in their dealings with other government agencies. Pursuant to this policy, part 268 has
been revised by the Board after the issuance by the Commission of its federal sector complaint processing regulations
(29 CFR part 1614) which became effective on October 1, 1992. A new part 268 was issued by the Board as an interim rule
effective February 18, 1993; (58 FR 9517, February 22, 1993) and is now issued as a final rule with revisions following
receipt and consideration of public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the Commission's new regulations, this final rule addresses matters of the kind addressed by Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 791), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended (29 U.S.C.
621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) and the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206(d)). Subpart G (Prohibition Against Discrimination In Board Programs And Activities
Because Of A Physical Or Mental Handicap) of the interim rule has also been revised consistent with recent revisions
to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission and one commenter recommended that the terms ``handicap'' and ``handicapped'' should be replaced
with ``disability'' or ``disabled'' throughout the Rules. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 substituted
the term ``disability'' for the term ``handicap'' throughout the Rehabilitation Act (Section 102(f), Pub. L. 102&hyph;569).
It is the Board's intention to update the language of its Rules to conform to the 1992 amendment with whatever updates
are made by the Commission. Although such revisions have not yet been incorporated in the Commission's regulations
(29 CFR part 1614), in light of the Commission's specific recommendations, the Board has substituted appropriate
language throughout the Rules as set forth above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter took exception to the deletion of section 703 (Self evaluation) of the prior Rules, which was in effect
prior to February 18, 1993. Section 703 had required the Board to evaluate its then current policies and practices,
and to make necessary modifications, regarding the upgrade of its facilities to conform to the standards of Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The time limits stated in section 703 have passed. The Board has conducted the required
survey of its facilities, and the Board has been implementing appropriate modifications to its facilities. Therefore,
the Board believes that section 703 has become moot. The Board believes that this is a technical deletion that does
not affect the Board's strong and continuing commitment to equal opportunity and equal access for individuals with
a disability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission suggested merging &sect;268.102(u) into &sect;268.102(t) of the Rules, so that both paragraphs
relate to sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Board has adopted this suggestion. The Commission also
suggested that the Board amend the definition of ``individual with a disability'' to exclude from the definition
alcoholics and individuals with current infectious diseases. With the assistance of the Commission's staff, the
Board has inserted language in &sect;268.303 which provides that alcoholics will be held to the same performance
and conduct standards that all other Board employees must satisfy, following the Commission's regulations regarding
holding alcoholics to the same performance and conduct standards to which an employer holds its other employees.
29 CFR 1630.16(b). In addition, language has been inserted to prevent persons with infectious diseases from working
in the Board's food handling area, following the Commission's regulations regarding infectious and communicable
diseases for food handling jobs. 29 CFR 1630.16(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission suggested that adoption of part 268 by the Board is unnecessary in light of the Commission's Government-wide
complaint processing procedures. 29 CFR part 1614. The Board believes, however, based on specific provisions of
the Federal Reserve Act and established precedent, that adoption of part 268 is necessary to authorize and insure
the Board's compliance with the important national policies set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and
the other laws cited above. The Board will continue to work closely with the Commission to insure effective implementation
of these Rules consistent with those laws and the policies of the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter expressed a concern regarding the organizational placement and reporting relationship
of the EEO Programs Officer. Citing the Commission's Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity regulations (29
CFR 1614.102(b)(3)), the commenter proposed that the EEO Programs Officer report to the Chairman of the Board of Governors.
The Commission addressed this matter in the preamble to its regulations and stated ``Moreover, &sect;1614.607 permits
[the agency head] to delegate that authority. Ultimate responsibility would remain, though, with the higher official.''
57 FR 12642, April 10, 1992. The Board believes that the EEO Programs Officer's reporting relationship is appropriate
and is consistent with the Commission's approach. In this connection, the Board's Rule provides that the EEO Programs

Other Revisions to Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional, minor modifications have been made in the final rule based on comments received from Board staff. These
modifications are not substantive: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The third sentence in &sect;268.103(c)(11) has been re-written to reflect actual practice concerning the EEO
Programs Director's contracting authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A new paragraph (d) has been added to &sect;268.202 stating that section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act is covered
by these Rules, which caused paragraphs (d) and (e) to be renumbered as paragraphs (e) and (f); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sections 268.202(e)(13), 268.205(c), 268.204(b) and 268.604(b) were modified to clarify existing language
in the interim rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 268.204(f) was modified to make it clear that the Board will develop and use alternative dispute resolution
procedures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 268.206(a)(7) was modified to provide that the Staff Director for Management or the General Counsel,
or their designees, should consult with the EEO Programs Director before issuing the certification as provided for
in subparagraph (7); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Because of the strict time limits governing the issuance of a final decision, &sect;&sect;268.209(a) and 268.709(k)
have been modified to provide that the Governors will have only 3 business days (formerly 7 calendar days) to ask that
a matter be brought to the full Board for final decision rather than be resolved by the Board's delegee; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Section 268.304(b)(3) was modified so that it now provides that the Board will prefer only U.S. citizens over equally
qualified noncitizens in hiring. This was done to insure compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act,
as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules are hereby issued as the Board's final rule and this final rule shall be made effective 30 days from publication.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Aggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age or disability must consult an EEO Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally
resolve the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An aggrieved person must initiate contact with an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged
to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the date that the action was communicated
to the aggrieved person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board shall extend the 45-day time limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when the individual shows that
he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that he or she did not know and reasonably
should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence he
or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting an EEO Counselor within the time limits,
or for other reasons considered sufficient by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At the initial counseling session, EEO Counselors must advise individuals in writing of their rights and responsibilities,
including the right to request a hearing after the investigation by the Board, the right to file a notice of intent to
sue pursuant to &sect;268.301(a) of this part and to file a lawsuit alleging a violation of the ADEA instead of an administrative
complaint of age discrimination under this part, the duty to mitigate damages, administrative and court time frames,
and that only the matter(s) raised in pre-complaint counseling (or issues like or related to issues raised in pre-complaint
counseling) may be alleged in a subsequent complaint filed with the Board. EEO Counselors must advise individuals
of their duty to keep the Board informed of their current address, to serve copies of requests for review by the Commission
on the Board, and to keep the Commission informed of their current address in connection with any review of a Board action.
The notice required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall include a notice of the right to file a class complaint.
If the aggrieved person informs an EEO Counselor that he or she wishes to file a class complaint, the EEO Counselor shall
explain the class complaint procedures and the responsibilities of the agent of the class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) EEO Counselors shall conduct counseling activities in accordance with instructions promulgated by the EEO Programs
Director, which shall be consistent with the counseling guidelines contained in the Commission's ``EEO Management
Directives For 29 CFR part 1614''. When advised that a complaint has been filed by an aggrieved person, the EEO Counselor
shall submit a written report within 15 calendar days to the EEO Programs Director and to the aggrieved person concerning

(d) Unless the aggrieved person agrees to a longer counseling period under paragraph (e) of this section, the EEO Counselor
shall conduct the final interview with the aggrieved person within 30 days of the date the aggrieved person brought
the matter to the EEO Counselor's attention. If the matter has not been resolved, the aggrieved person shall be informed
in writing by the EEO Counselor, not later than the 30th day after contacting the EEO Counselor, of the right to file
a discrimination complaint with the Board. This notice shall inform the complainant of the right to file a discrimination
complaint within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, of the appropriate official with whom to file a complaint
and of the complainant's duty to assure that the EEO Programs Director is informed immediately if the complainant
retains counsel or a representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Prior to the end of the 30-day period, the aggrieved person may agree in writing with the Board to postpone the final
interview and extend the counseling period for an additional period of no more than 60 days. If the matter has not been
resolved before the conclusion of the agreed extension, the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section shall
be issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In the event the aggrieved person believes that he/she has been discriminated against and agrees to participate
in an established Board alternative dispute resolution procedure, the pre-complaint processing period of this
section will be 90 days. If the matter has not been resolved before the 90th day, the notice described in paragraph (d)
of this section shall then be issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The EEO Counselor shall not attempt in any way to restrain the aggrieved person from filing a complaint. The EEO
Counselor shall not reveal the identity of an aggrieved person who consulted the EEO Counselor, except when authorized

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The complainant has the right to file a request for review with the Commission with regard to the Board's final decision
or dismissal of all or a portion of a complaint; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board is required to conduct a complete and fair investigation of the complaint within 180 days of the filing
of the complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Board shall dismiss a complaint or a portion of a complaint: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That fails to state a claim under &sect;&sect;268.203 and 268.205(c) of this part, or states the same claim that
is pending before or has been decided by the Board or the Commission; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That fails to comply with the applicable time limits contained in &sect;&sect;268.204, 268.205(b) and 268.305(b)
of this part, unless the Board extends the time limits in accordance with &sect;268.604(c) of this part, or that raises
a matter that has not been brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor and is not like or related to a matter that has been
brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That is the basis of a pending civil action in a United States District Court in which the complainant is a party,
provided that at least 180 days have passed since the filing of the administrative complaint, or that was the basis
of a civil action decided by a United States District Court in which the complainant was a party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel
action, is discriminatory; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Where the complainant cannot be located, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to locate the complainant
and the complainant has not responded within 15 calendar days to a notice of proposed dismissal sent to his or her last
known address; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the Board has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information or otherwise
proceed with the complaint, and the complainant has failed to respond to the request within 15 calendar days of its
receipt or the complainant's response does not address the Board's request, provided that the request included a
notice of the proposed dismissal. Instead of dismissing for failure to cooperate, the complaint may be adjudicated
if sufficient information for that purpose is available; or

the Board's Staff Director for Management, the General Counsel or a designee reporting directly to the Staff Director
for Management or General Counsel (after consulting with the EEO Programs Director) that the offer constitutes full
relief, provided that the offer gave notice that failure to accept would result in dismissal of the complaint. An offer
of full relief under this paragraph (a)(7) is the appropriate relief in &sect;268.501 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Board shall inform the complainant of the right to file a request for review with the Commission with regard
to the dismissal of the individual complaint pursuant to &sect;268.401 of this part, or to file a civil action. A copy
of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision to dismiss an individual complaint

Investigation of complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The investigation of individual complaints shall be conducted by an investigator appointed by the EEO Programs
Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Consistent with guidance proffered by the Commission, the Board, through the EEO Programs Director, shall develop
a complete and impartial factual record upon which to make findings on the matters raised by the written complaint.
The investigator may use an exchange of letters or memoranda, interrogatories, investigations, fact-finding conferences
or any other fact-finding methods that efficiently and thoroughly address the matters at issue. The EEO Programs
Director may incorporate alterative dispute resolution techniques into the investigation in order to promote early
resolution of complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section apply to the investigation of complaints: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The complainant, the Board and any employee of the Board shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence
as the investigator deems necessary, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies of the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The investigator may administer oaths. Statements of witnesses shall be made under oath or affirmation or, alteratively,
by written statement under penalty of perjury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the complainant, or the Board or its employees, fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely
fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits or the attendance of witness(es),
the investigator may note in the investigative record that the Board when rendering a final decision should, or the
Commission on review may, in appropriate circumstances:

(i) Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have
reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the
opposing party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If documentary or testimonial evidence is needed by the investigator, and such documentary evidence is known
to be contained in the files of another federal agency, or the testimony of an employee of another federal agency is
needed, the EEO Programs Director shall, if necessary, contact the Commission for assistance in obtaining such documentary
or testimonial evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The investigation shall be conducted by an investigator with appropriate security clearances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Board shall complete its investigation within 180 days of the date of the filing of an individual complaint
or within the time period contained in the determination of the Commission on review of a dismissal pursuant to &sect;268.206
of this part. By written agreement within those time periods, the complainant and the Board may voluntarily extend
the time period for not more than an additional 90 days. The Board may unilaterally extend the time period or any period
of extension for not more than 30 days where it must sanitize a complaint file that may contain confidential information
of the Board under 12 CFR part 261, or other privileged information of the Board, provided the Board notifies the complainant
of the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Within 180 days from the filing of the complaint, within the time period contained in a determination of the Commission's
Office of Federal Operations on review of a dismissal, or within any period of extension provided for in paragraph
(e) of this section, the Board shall notify the complainant that the investigation has been completed, shall provide
the complainant with a copy of the investigative file, and shall notify the complainant that, within 30 days of the
receipt of the investigative file, the complainant has the right to request a hearing before an administrative judge
from the Commission or may receive an immediate final decision pursuant to &sect;268.209 of this part from the Board.
In the absence of the required notice, the complainant may request a hearing under &sect;268.208 of this part at any
time after 180 days has elapsed from the filing of the complaint.

Requests
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. When a complainant requests a hearing, the EEO Programs Director shall request the Commission to appoint an administrative
judge to conduct a hearing in accordance with this section. Any hearing will be conducted by an administrative judge
or hearing examiner with appropriate security clearances. Where the administrative judge determines that the complainant
is raising or intends to pursue issues like or related to those raised in the complaint, but which the Board has not had
an opportunity to address, the administrative judge shall remand any such issue for counseling in accordance with
&sect;268.204 of this part or for such other processing as may be ordered by the administrative judge.

. The administrative judge shall notify the parties of the right to seek discovery prior to the hearing and may issue
such discovery orders as are appropriate. Unless the parties agree in writing concerning the methods and scope of
discovery, the party seeking discovery shall request authorization from the administrative judge prior to commencing
discovery. Both parties are entitled to reasonable development of evidence on matters relevant to the issues raised
in the complaint, but the administrative judge may reasonably limit the quantity and timing of discovery. Evidence
may be developed through interrogatories, depositions, and requests for admissions, stipulations or production
of documents. It shall be grounds for objection to producing evidence that the information sought by either party
is irrelevant, overburdensome, repetitious, privileged, or that production would be unlawful.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conduct of hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Board shall provide for the attendance at a hearing of all Board employees approved as witnesses by an administrative
judge. Attendance at hearings will be limited to persons determined by the administrative judge to have direct knowledge
relating to the complaint. Hearings are part of the investigative process and are thus closed to the public. The administrative
judge shall have the power to regulate the conduct of a hearing, limit the number of witnesses where testimony would
be repetitious, and exclude any person from the hearing for contumacious conduct or misbehavior that obstructs the
hearing. The administrative judge shall receive into evidence information or documents relevant to the complaint.
Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, but the administrative judge shall exclude irrelevant or repetitious
evidence. The administrative judge or the Commission may refer to the Disciplinary Committee of the appropriate
Bar Association any attorney or, upon reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, suspend or disqualify from
representing complainants or agencies in hearings raising claims of discrimination any representative who refuses
to follow the orders of an administrative judge, or who otherwise engages in improper conduct. The Board in such circumstances
may take whatever action it deems appropriate to suspend or disqualify any such attorney or representative from appearing
or practicing before the Board.

. The procedures in paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section apply to hearings of complaints: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The complainant, the Board and any employee of the Board shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence
as the administrative judge deems necessary, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies of the Board.
If documentary or testimonial evidence is needed for the hearing, and such documentary evidence is known to be contained
in the files of another federal agency, or if the testimony of an employee of another federal agency is needed, then
the administrative judge may seek assistance from appropriate sources in obtaining such documentary or testimonial
evidence for the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Administrative judges are authorized to administer oaths. Statements of witnesses shall be made under oath or
affirmation or, alternatively, by written statement under penalty of perjury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the complainant, or the Board or its employees fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely
fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es),
the administrative judge may, in appropriate circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have
reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the
opposing party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Issue a finding fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or

Findings and conclusions without hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) If a party believes that some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute and there is no genuine issue as to
credibility, the party may, at least 15 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing or at such earlier time as required
by the administrative judge, file a statement with the administrative judge prior to the hearing setting forth the
fact or facts and referring to the parts of the record relied on to support the statement. The statement must demonstrate
that there is no genuine issue as to any such material fact. The party shall serve the statement on the opposing party.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The opposing party may file an opposition within 15 calendar days of receipt of the statement in paragraph (e)(1)
of this section. The opposition may refer to the record in the case to rebut the statement that a fact is not in dispute
or may file an affidavit stating that the party cannot, for reasons stated, present facts to oppose the request. After
considering the submissions, the administrative judge may order that discovery be permitted on the fact or facts
involved, limit the hearing to the issues remaining in dispute, issue findings and conclusions without a hearing
or make such other ruling as is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the administrative judge determines upon his or her own initiative that some or all facts are not in genuine dispute,
he or she may, after giving notice to the parties and providing them an opportunity to respond in writing within 15 calendar
days, issue an order limiting the scope of the hearing or issue findings and conclusions without holding a hearing.

. Unless the administrative judge makes a written determination that good cause exists for extending the time for
issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 180 days of a request for a hearing being received by the Commission,
an administrative judge shall issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits of the complaint, and shall
order appropriate relief where discrimination is found with regard to the matter that gave rise to the complaint.
The administrative judge shall send copies of the entire record, including the transcript, and the findings and conclusions

General policy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board shall give full consideration to the hiring, placement and advancement of qualified individuals with a
disability who are physically or mentally disabled. The Board shall be a model employer of individuals with a disability.
The Board shall not discriminate against individuals with a disability who are physically or mentally disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable accommodation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Board shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an employee or applicant
for employment who is a qualified individual with a disability unless the Board can demonstrate that the accommodation
would impose an undue hardship on its operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Making facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with a disability; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,
appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, and other similar
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining whether, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an accommodation would impose an undue
hardship on the operation of the Board, factors to be considered include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The overall size of the Board's operations with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities
and size of budget; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The type of Board operation, including the composition and structure of the Board's work force; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Employment criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Board shall not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen
out qualified individuals with a disability or any class of individuals with a disability unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The test score or other selection criterion is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business
necessity; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There are no available alterative job-related tests that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many individuals
with a disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as to insure that, when administered to an
employee or applicant for employment who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test
results accurately reflect the employee's or applicant's ability to perform the position or type of position in question
rather than reflecting the employee's or applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skill (except where
those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-employment inquiries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the Board shall not conduct a pre-employment medical
examination and shall not make pre-employment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is an individual
with a disability or as to the nature or severity of a disability. The Board may, however, make pre-employment inquiry
into an applicant's ability to meet the essential functions of the job, or the medical qualification requirements
if applicable, with or without reasonable accommodation, of the position in question, i.e., the minimum abilities
necessary for safe and efficient performance of the duties of the position in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Board from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of disability or when the pre-employment
medical questionnaire used for positions that do not routinely require medical examination indicates a condition
for which further examination is required because of the job-related nature of the condition; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the gathering of pre-employment medical information for
the purpose of hiring individuals with a disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To enable and evaluate affirmative action to hire, place or advance individuals with a disability, the Board may
invite employees and applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are disabled, if:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The Board states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written
questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in conjunction with affirmative
action; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Board states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that refusal to provide
it will not subject the employee or applicant for employment to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only
in accordance with this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the employee or
applicant for employment shall be kept confidential except that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Managers, selecting officials, and others involved in the selection process or responsible for affirmative
action may be informed that the employee or applicant for employment is an individual with a disability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary accommodations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 (1) The Board shall not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment who are qualified individuals
with a disability due to the inaccessibility of its facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It shall be the policy of the Board to comply with the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, the Architectural Barriers
Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reassignment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a nonprobationary employee becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with
reasonable accommodation due to a disability, the Board shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant
position at the same grade level, the essential functions of which the employee would be able to perform with reasonable
accommodation if necessary unless the reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the Board.
In the absence of a position at the same grade level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available
grade level below the employee's current grade level shall be made, but availability of such a vacancy shall not affect
the employee's entitlement, if any, to disability retirement pursuant to any retirement plan in which the employee
is enrolled. If the Board has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position
at the time the Board has determined that the nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions
of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the Board does not have an obligation under this section
to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the Board shall consider the individual on an equal basis
with those who applied for the position.

use of drugs, when the Board acts on the basis of such use. The term ``drug'' means a controlled substance, as defined
in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812). The term ``illegal use of drugs''
means the use of drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act, but
does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized
by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of federal law. This exclusion, however, does not exclude an

 The term ``individual with a disability'' does not include an employee who is an alcoholic whose current use of alcohol
prevents the employee from performing the duties of his or her job, or whose employment by reason of such current alcohol
use, would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of others. In this regard, alcoholics shall meet the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Within 30 days of the Board's receipt of a class complaint, the Board shall designate a representative who shall
monitor the class complaint on behalf of the Board and who shall be one of the individuals referenced in &sect;268.202(e)(3)
of this part, and forward the class complaint, along with a copy of the EEO Counselor's report and any other information
pertaining to timeliness or other relevant circumstances related to the class complaint, to the Commission's Office
of Federal Operations. The Commission shall assign the class complaint to an administrative judge or complaints
examiner who shall, if required, have a proper security clearance. The administrative judge may require the agent
of the class or the Board to submit additional information relevant to the complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The administrative judge may recommend that the Board dismiss the class complaint, or any portion, for any of the
reasons listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;268.206 of this part, or because it does not meet the prerequisites of a class complaint under &sect;268.102(g)
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If an allegation of discrimination in the class complaint is not included in the EEO Counselor's report, the administrative
judge shall afford the agent of the class 15 calendar days to state whether the matter was discussed with the EEO Counselor
and, if not, explain why it was not discussed. If the explanation is not satisfactory, the administrative judge shall
recommend that the Board dismiss the allegation under &sect;268.206 of this part. If the explanation is satisfactory,
the administrative judge shall refer the allegation to the Board for further counseling by an EEO Counselor with the
agent of the class. After counseling, the allegation shall be consolidated with the class complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If an allegation of discrimination in the class complaint lacks specificity and detail, the administrative judge
shall afford the agent of the class 15 calendar days to provide specific and detailed information. The administrative
judge shall recommend that the Board dismiss the class complaint if the agent of the class fails to provide such information
within the specified time period. If the information provided contains new allegations outside the scope of the complaint,
the administrative judge shall advise the agent of the class how to proceed on an individual or class basis concerning
these allegations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The administrative judge shall recommend that the Board extend the time limits for filing a class complaint and
for consulting with an EEO Counselor in accordance with the time limit extension provisions contained in &sect;&sect;268.204(a)(2)
and 268.604 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When appropriate, the administrative judge may recommend that a class be divided into subclasses and that each
subclass be treated as a class, and the provisions of this section shall then be construed and applied accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The administrative judge's written recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or dismiss a class complaint
and the complaint file shall be transmitted to the Board, and notification of that transmittal shall be sent to the
agent of the class. The administrative judge's recommendation to accept or dismiss shall become the Board's decision
unless the Board accepts, rejects or modifies the recommended decision within 30 days of the receipt of the recommended
decision and complaint file pursuant to &sect;268.209 of this part. The Board shall notify the agent of the class by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the administrative judge of its decision to accept or dismiss a class
complaint. At the same time, the Board shall forward to the agent of the class copies of the administrative judge's
recommendation and the complaint file. The dismissal of a class complaint shall inform the agent of the class either
that the class complaint is being filed on that date as an individual complaint of discrimination and will be processed
under subpart B of this part, or that the class complaint is also dismissed as an individual complaint in accordance
with &sect;268.206 of this part. In addition, it shall inform the agent of the class of the right to file a request for
review of the dismissal of the class complaint with the Commission pursuant to &sect;268.401 of this part, or to file
a civil action. A copy of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision to dismiss
a class complaint pursuant to &sect;268.209(b)(4) of this part.

Obtaining evidence concerning the complaint.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Upon the acceptance of a class complaint by the Board, the administrative judge shall notify the agent of the class
and the Board's representative of the time period that will be allowed both parties to prepare their case. This time
period will include at least 60 days and may be extended by the administrative judge upon the request of either party.
Both parties are entitled to reasonable development of evidence on matters relevant to the issues raised in the class
complaint. Evidence may be developed through interrogatories, depositions, and requests for admissions, stipulations
or production of documents. It shall be grounds for objection to producing evidence that the information sought by
either party is irrelevant, overburdensome, repetitious, privileged, or that production would be unlawful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If mutual cooperation fails, either party may request the administrative judge to rule on a request to develop
evidence. If a party fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to a request made or approved
by the administrative judge for documents, records, comparative data, statistics or affidavits, and the information
is solely in the control of one party, such failure may, in appropriate circumstances, cause the administrative judge:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing
to provide the requested information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To consider the matters to which the requested information pertains to be established in favor of the opposing
party;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) To recommend that a decision be entered in favor of the opposing party; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) To take such other actions as the administrative judge deems appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the period for development of evidence, the administrative judge may, in his or her discretion, direct
that an investigation of facts relevant to the class complaint or any portion be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Both parties shall furnish to the administrative judge copies of all materials that they wish to be examined and
such other material as may be requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Opportunity for resolution of the class complaint.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The administrative judge shall furnish the agent of the class and the Board's representative a copy of all materials
obtained concerning the class complaint and provide opportunity for the agent of the class to discuss the materials
with the Board's representative and to attempt resolution of the class complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The class complaint may be resolved by agreement of the Board and the agent of the class at any time as long as the agreement
is fair and reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the class complaint is resolved, the terms of the resolution shall be reduced to writing and signed by the agent
of the class and the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Notice of the agreement of resolution shall be given to all class members in the same manner as notification of the
acceptance of the class complaint and shall state the relief, if any, to be granted by the Board. An agreement of resolution
shall bind all members of the class. Within 30 days of the date of the notice of the agreement of resolution, any member
of the class may petition the Commission to vacate the agreement of resolution because it benefits only the agent of
the class or is otherwise not fair and reasonable. Such a petition will be processed in accordance with paragraph (c)
of this section and if the administrative judge finds that the agreement of resolution is not fair and reasonable,
he or she shall recommend that the agreement of resolution be vacated and that the original agent of the class be replaced
by the petitioner or some other class member who is eligible to be the agent of the class during further processing of
the class complaint. The Board may determine, with respect to the petition, that the agreement of resolution is not
fair and reasonable, which vacates any agreement between the former agent of the class and the Board. The Board's decision
to vacate the agreement of resolution shall be communicated to the former agent of the class and to the petitioner,
and shall inform them of their right to file a request for review with the Commission under &sect;268.401 of this part.
A copy of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision pursuant to &sect;268.209(b)(5)
of this part.

Relief for an applicant. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) (i) When it is determined in a final decision that an applicant for employment has been discriminated against,
the Board shall offer the applicant for employment the position that the applicant for employment would have occupied
absent discrimination or, if justified by the circumstances, a substantially equivalent position unless clear
and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant for employment would not have been selected even absent the
discrimination. The offer to the applicant for employment shall be made in writing. The applicant for employment
shall have 15 days from receipt of the offer within which to accept or decline the offer. Failure to accept the offer
within the 15-day period will be considered a declination of the offer, unless the applicant for employment can show
that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented a response within the time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the offer is accepted, appointment shall be retroactive to the date the applicant for employment would have
been hired. Back pay, computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 shall be awarded from the date the applicant
for employment would have entered on duty until the date the applicant for employment actually enters on duty unless
clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant would not have been selected even absent discrimination.
Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation where sovereign immunity has been waived. An applicant
for employment shall be deemed to have performed service at the Board during such period for all purposes except for
meeting service requirements for completion of a required probationary period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the offer of employment is declined, the Board shall award the applicant for employment a sum equal to the back
pay he or she would have received, computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 from the date he or she would have
been appointed until the date the offer was declined, subject to the limitation of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation. The Board shall inform the applicant for employment,
in its offer of employment, of the right to this award in the event the offer of employment is declined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When it is determined in a final decision that discrimination existed at the time the applicant for employment
was considered for employment but also by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant would not have been hired
even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless take all steps necessary to eliminate the discriminatory
practice and ensure it does not recur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Back pay under this paragraph (b) for complaints under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act may not extend from a
date earlier than two years prior to the date on which the complaint was initially filed by the applicant for employment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Nondiscriminatory placement, with back pay computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 unless clear and
convincing evidence contained in the record demonstrates that the personnel action would have been taken even absent
the discrimination. Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation where sovereign immunity has
been waived. The back pay liability under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act is limited to the two years prior to the
date the discrimination complaint was filed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If clear and convincing evidence indicates that, although discrimination existed at the time the personnel action
was taken, the personnel action would have been taken even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless eliminate
any discriminatory practice and ensure it does not recur; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cancellation of an unwarranted personnel action and restoration of the employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Expunction from the Board's records of any adverse materials relating to the discriminatory practice; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

evidence that the employee or applicant for employment has failed to mitigate damages. The Board shall have the burden
of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the complainant has failed to mitigate his or her damages.

Awards of attorney's fees or costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of this paragraph (e) relating to the award of attorney's fees or costs shall apply to allegations of
discrimination prohibited by Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In a notice of final action or a decision, the employee
or applicant for employment may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees or costs (including expert witness fees) incurred
in the processing of the complaint. In this regard: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A finding of discrimination raises a presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney's fees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Attorney's fees are allowable only for the services of members of the Bar and law clerks, paralegals or law students
under the supervision of members of the Bar, except that no award is allowable for the services of any employee of the
Federal Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Attorney's fees shall be paid only for services performed after the filing of a written complaint and after the
complainant has notified the Board that he or she is represented by an attorney, except that fees allowable for a reasonable
period of time prior to the notification of representation for any services performed in reaching a determination
to represent the complainant. Written submissions to the Board that are signed by the representative shall be deemed
to constitute notice of representation.

Amount of awards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When the attorney's fees or costs are awarded, the complainant's attorney shall submit a verified statement of
costs and attorney's fees (including expert witness fees), as appropriate, to the Board within 30 days of receipt
of the final decision, unless a request for review or reconsideration is filed. A statement of attorney's fees shall
be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing the attorney's charges for legal services
and both the verified statement and the accompanying affidavit shall be made a part of the complaint file. The amount
of attorney's fees or costs to be awarded the complainant shall be determined by agreement among the complainant,
the complainant's representative and the Board. Such agreement shall immediately be reduced to writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) (A) If the complainant, the complainant's representative and the Board cannot reach an agreement on the amount
of attorney's fees or costs within 20 days of the Board's receipt of the verified statement and accompanying affidavit,
the Board shall issue a decision determining the amount of attorney's fees or costs due within 30 days of receipt of
the statement and affidavit. The decision of the Board shall include the specific reasons for determining the amount
of the award. The complainant or the complainant's representative may file a request for review with the Commission
of the Board's decision, and the Board's notice to the complainant and his or her representative shall include EEOC
Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) The amount of attorney's fees shall be calculated in accordance with existing case law using the following standards:
The starting point shall be the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This amount
may be reduced or increased in consideration of the following factors, although ordinarily many of these factors
are subsumed within the calculation set forth in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B): The time and labor required, the novelty
and difficulty of the questions, the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly, the attorney's preclusion
from other employment due to acceptance of the case, the customary fee, whether the fee is fixed or contingent, time
limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, the amount involved and the results obtained, the experience,
reputation, and ability of the attorney, the undesirability of the case, the nature and length of the professional
relationship with the client, and the awards in similar cases. Only in cases of exceptional success should any of these
factors be used to enhance an award computed by the formula set forth in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The costs that may be awarded are those authorized by 28 U.S.C. 1920 to include: Fees of the reporter for all or any
of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and
witnesses; and fees for exemplification and copies necessarily obtained for use in the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Witness fees shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1821, except that no award shall

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, when the Board requests reconsideration, when the case involves
an employee's removal, separation, or suspension continuing beyond the date of the request for reconsideration,
and when the EEOC decision recommends retroactive restoration, the Board shall comply with the EEOC decision only
to the extent of the temporary or conditional restoration of the employee to duty status in the position recommended

that the Board has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement or a final decision, the complainant shall
notify the EEO Programs Director, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance within 30 days of when the complainant
knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance. The complainant may request that the Board implement the terms
of the settlement agreement or final decision or alteratively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing
from the point processing ceased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Board shall attempt to resolve the matter brought to the Board's attention by the complainant in paragraph
(a) of this section, and respond to the complainant, in writing. If the Board has not responded to the complainant,
in writing, or if the complainant is not satisfied with the Board's attempt to resolve the matter, the complainant
may request the Commission to review whether the Board has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement or the
final decision. The complainant may file such request for review 35 days after he or she has served the Board with the
notice of allegations of noncompliance, but must file the request for review with the Commission within 30 days of
his or her receipt of a Board's determination. The complainant must serve a copy of the request for review on the Board
and the Board may submit a response to the Commission within 30 days of receiving notice of request for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to rendering its determination, the Commission may request that the parties submit whatever additional
information or documentation they deem necessary, or it may direct that an investigation or hearing on the matter
be conducted. If the Commission determines that the Board is not in compliance and the noncompliance is not attributable
to acts or conduct of the complainant, it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the
point processing ceased. Allegations that subsequent acts of discrimination violate a settlement agreement shall
be processed as separate complaints under &sect;&sect;268.205 or 268.305 of this part, as appropriate, rather than
under this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Board shall collect and maintain accurate employment information on the race, national origin, sex and disabilities
of its employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Data on race, national origin and sex shall be collected by voluntary self-identification. If an employee does
not voluntarily provide the requested information, the Board shall advise the employee of the importance of the data
and of the Board's obligation to report it. If the employee still refuses to provide the information, the Board shall
make a visual identification and inform the employee of the data it will be reporting. If the Board believes that information
provided by an employee is inaccurate, the Board shall advise the employee that the purpose for which the data is being
collected is solely statistical, of the need for accuracy, of the Board's recognition of the sensitivity of the information,
and of the existence of procedures to prevent its unauthorized disclosure. If, thereafter, the employee declines
to change the apparently inaccurate self identification, the Board shall accept it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Subject to applicable law, the information collected under paragraph (b) of this section shall be disclosed only
in the form of gross statistics. The Board will not collect or maintain any information on the race, national origin,
or sex of individual employees except in accordance with applicable law and when an automated data processing system
is used in accordance with standards and requirements prescribed by the Commission to insure individual privacy
and the separation of that information from the employee's personnel record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Board's system shall incorporate the following controls:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only those categories of race and national origin approved by the Commission shall be used; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only the specific procedures for the collection and maintenance of data that are prescribed or approved by the
Commission shall be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Board shall use the data only in studies and analyses that contribute affirmatively to achieving the objectives
of the Board's equal employment opportunity program. The Board shall not establish quotas for the employment of persons
on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Data on disabilities shall also be collected by voluntary self-identification. If an employee does not voluntarily
provide the requested information, the Board shall advise the employee of the importance of the data and of the Board's
obligation to report it. If an employee who has been appointed pursuant to the Board's affirmative action program
for hiring individuals with a disability still refuses to provide the requested information, the Board shall identify
the employee's disability based upon the records supporting the appointment. If any other employee still refuses
to provide the requested information or provides information that the Board believes to be inaccurate, the Board
shall report the employee's disability status as unknown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Board shall report to the Commission on employment by race, national origin, sex and disability in the form
and at such times as the Board and Commission shall agree.

the complainant shall have the right to be accompanied, represented and advised by a representative of complainant's
choice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the complainant is an employee of the Board, he or she shall have a reasonable amount of official time, if otherwise
on duty, to prepare the complaint and to respond to Board and Commission requests for information. If the complainant
is an employee of the Board and he or she designates another employee of the Board as his or her representative, the representative
shall have a reasonable amount of official time, if otherwise on duty, to prepare the complaint and respond to Board
and Commission requests for information. The Board is not obligated to change work schedules, incur overtime wages,
or pay travel expenses to facilitate the choice of a specific representative or to allow the complainant and representative
to confer. The complainant and the representative, if employed by the Board and otherwise in a pay status, shall be
on official time, regardless of their tours of duty, when their presence is authorized or required by the Board or the
Commission during the investigation, informal adjustment, or hearing on the complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In cases where the representation of a complainant or the Board would conflict with the official or collateral
duties of the representative, the Board may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify
the representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Unless the complainant states otherwise in writing, after the Board has received written notice of the name, address
and telephone number of a representative, all official correspondence shall be with the representative with copies
to the complainant. When the complainant designates an attorney as representative, service of documents and decisions
on the complaint shall be made on the attorney and not on the complainant, and time frames for receipt of materials by
the complainant shall be computed from the time of receipt by the attorney. The complainant must serve all official
correspondence on the designated representative of the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The complainant shall at all times be responsible for proceeding with the complaint whether or not he or she has
designated a representative.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPs. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the
anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations governing the Customs field organization by establishing Santa Teresa,
New Mexico, as a port of entry. The document also establishes the Santa Teresa Airport, which is within the boundaries
of the port of entry, as a designated airport for the purposes of report of arrival and Customs clearance. Currently,
Santa Teresa is a temporary Customs station, and Santa Teresa Airport is operating as a landing rights airport. Because
of the traffic in the area which already exists, and the anticipated growth in that traffic, Customs has determined
that a need exists to create a port of entry at Santa Teresa. Through this change, the general public and importers will
be served better and Customs personnel and resources will be more efficiently utilized.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As part of its continuing program to obtain more efficient use of its personnel, facilities and resources, and to provide
better service to carriers, importers and the public, Customs is amending &sect;101.3, Customs Regulations (19
CFR 101.3), by establishing a port of entry at Santa Teresa, New Mexico and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is amending &sect;122.24(b) by adding the Santa Teresa Airport to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of airports designated as airports at which private aircraft arriving in the Continental U.S. via the U.S.
- Mexican border from a foreign place in the Western Hemisphere south of the U.S. can land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 33462) on July 29, 1992, proposing these actions and inviting the public to comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received in response to the proposal. After further review, Customs has determined to amend the regulations
as proposed. Until this amendment becomes effective, the only port of entry along the New Mexico-Mexico border is
located in the far western portion of the state. Because the amount of traffic in the Santa Teresa area has increased
recently, Customs has established, as an interim measure, a temporary Customs station at Santa Teresa under the authority
of &sect;101.4(d), Customs Regulations. The airport at Santa Teresa, which recently lost its status as a user fee
airport by operation of law, is now operating as a landing rights airport. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishing Santa Teresa as a Port of Entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria for determining whether a port of entry should be established by Customs was initially identified in
T.D. 82&hyph;37 on March 9, 1982 (47 FR 10137). The criteria in that T.D. were subsequently revised by T.D. 86&hyph;14
(February 5, 1986, 51 FR 4559) and T.D. 87&hyph;65 (May 4, 1987, 52 FR 16328). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria used by Customs in determining whether a port of entry shall be established are whether the community
requesting creation of the port can: (1) Demonstrate that the benefits to be derived justify the Federal Government
expense involved; (2) be serviced by at least two major modes of transportation (rail, air, water, or highway); and
(3) has a minimum population of 300,000 within the immediate service area (approximately a 70-mile radius). In addition,
T.D. 82&hyph;37 provides that the actual or potential Customs workload (minimum number of transactions per year)
must meet one of several alternate criteria, one of which is 2,500 consumption entries (each valued over $1000.00)
of which no more than half can be attributed to one private party. Finally, T.D. 82&hyph;37 provides that the facilities
at the location must include adequate warehousing space for secure storage of imported cargo pending final Customs
inspection and release, and administrative office space, inspection areas, storage areas and other space necessary
for regular Customs operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Commissioner of the Southwest Region has reported to Customs Headquarters that the Santa Teresa area
is well served by air, rail, and highway modes of transportation. The population within a 70-mile radius of the port
is contained in a variety of jurisdictional units and communities. Both El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico are within
that radius, as are several smaller communities. The 1990 El Paso County estimated population was over 606,000, while
Dona Ana County, New Mexico added another 15,000. The estimated 1990 population of Juarez, Mexico is 1.2 million.
All these figures are expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Creation of a port of entry at Santa Teresa
will more evenly distribute the vehicular traffic which is currently forced to pass through El Paso, Texas. There
is significant construction taking place in and around the vicinity of Santa Teresa to build inspection booths and
stations, administration buildings and other support facilities to allow Customs to perform its mission in a safe
and efficient manner. The Mexican Government was instrumental in assisting construction of a new paved road to the
border from Mexico which was completed in early October 1993. Customs has received commitments from several corporate
importers that they will utilize Santa Teresa as a port of entry once it becomes operational. Studies conducted by
several sources have indicated that, once the port becomes operational, over 25,000 commercial vehicles will use
the port per year, and approximately 6,000 consumption entries will be filed per year at the land border port. The local
Chamber of Commerce reports that several corporations have expressed interest in locating in the area in anticipation
of Santa Teresa's being designated a port of entry by Customs. Economic benefits, in the form of additional employment,
are already being felt in the community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period Santa Teresa has been operating as a temporary Customs station, Customs has achieved notable results
in obtaining commitments from the trade community regarding their use of electronic data input for the processing
of entries. Currently, most of the brokers or importers filing entries are automated. No current importer dominates
the scene, and, as the surrounding infrastructure continues to improve, additional entities have expressed their
intentions to utilize the port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the only port of entry along the New Mexico-Mexico border is located in the far western portion of the state.
Diplomatic negotiations have been held with the Government of Mexico concerning the creation of a port of entry at
Santa Teresa, and both governments are in agreement with such an action.

Port of Entry Boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundaries of the port of entry of Santa Teresa are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning at the junction of the boundary between Texas and New Mexico with the U.S.-Mexico border, west, along the
Mexico-U.S. border until it intersects the range line between Range 1 East and Range 2 East, New Mexico Principal Meridian;
at that point, north along that range line until it reaches the line between Township 27 South and Township 28 South;
then east along the Township line until it reaches the Texas-New Mexico border; then south-east along the Texas-New
Mexico border to the beginning point.

Santa Teresa Airport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, Customs is also amending &sect;122.24(b) by adding the Santa Teresa Airport, which is within the boundaries
of the port of entry, to the list of airports designated as airports at which private aircraft arriving in the Continental
U.S. must report intended arrival pursuant to &sect;122.23(b) and land for Customs processing in accordance with
&sect;122.24(b). Section 122.23(b) provides, essentially, that all private aircraft arriving in the Continental
U.S. via the U.S.-Mexican border, from a foreign place in the Western Hemisphere south of 33 degrees north latitude,
or from any place in Mexico, shall furnish notice of intended arrival to Customs at the nearest designated airport
to the point of crossing for the first landing in the U.S. &sect;122.24 provides that such aircraft shall land for Customs
processing at the nearest designated airport to the border or coastline crossing point. At present, there is no designated
airport in the State of New Mexico. The identification of the Santa Teresa Airport as a designated airport by Customs
will benefit the flying public by increasing the options available for reporting arrival and obtaining Customs processing.
The addition of this airport will also reduce delays at existing designated airports by permitting a better distribution
of the inspection burden.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense is engaged in a major downsizing, resulting in less land and buildings needed to support
defense missions. Congressional legislation in 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;526) and 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510) provided
for non-partisan Commissions to assess the closure recommendations of the Secretary of Defense, and make base closure
and realignment recommendations to the President and the Congress. The bases recommended for closure and realignment
by the 1988, 1991, 1993 Commissions were all approved under this process. Another Commission will meet in 1995. As
a result of the 1988, 1991 and 1993 actions, the Department of Defense is now in the process of closing 70 major installations
throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even in large cities a military base often represents a major employment center and a significant economic stimulus
for the local economy. With its multimillion dollar payrolls a base closure can be a serious blow to the local community.
The Department of Defense recognizes that the manner in which real and personal property at closing bases is disposed
of can have a dramatic impact on the local community's prospects for economic recovery. In the past, the traditional
property disposal methods focused on maximizing proceeds from the sale of real and personal property with little
regard for enhancing the prospects for economic recovery in the community. Recognizing that the old way of doing business
was not designed to dispose of major military installations in a way that would revitalize base closure communities,
President Clinton announced, on July 2, 1993, a major new program to speed the economic recovery of communities where
military bases are slated to close. In a sharp departure from the past, the Clinton Administration pledged to give
top priority to early reuse of the base's valuable assets. Rapid redevelopment and the creation of new jobs in base
closure communities are the goals of the new initiative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In announcing the program, the President outlined the following five parts of his community reinvestment program:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Jobs-centered property disposal that puts local economic redevelopment first.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fast-track environmental cleanup that removes needless delays while protecting human health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transition coordinators at major bases slated for closure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Easy access to transition and redevelopment help for workers and communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Larger economic development planning grants to base closure communities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the task of remaking the economic foundation of a community is never easy, a closed military base can be a community's
single greatest asset in charting a new future. An airfield, a port, or the land, buildings, furniture and equipment
on a base can be a catalyst for new economic activity. The Administration's plan to make base property more affordable
to communities for the purpose of job creation is a fundamental change. It allows communities that have viable plans
for economic redevelopment to obtain property at prices within their means. The President's Five-Part Plan was an
important step in steering the base closure and reuse process toward rapid job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In announcing the community revitalization program, President Clinton recognized that existing Federal law required
the Department of Defense to charge full price when closed bases will be used for job-creating economic development,
yet it can transfer bases for free for a variety of ``public'' uses, including recreation, aviation, education and
health. President Clinton stated that the Administration would seek to change the law, to enable the Department of
Defense to transfer property for free or at a discount for economic development purposes, when community development
plans meet a strict test for economic viability and job creation. Accordingly, the President asked the National Economic
Council (NEC) an interagency coordinating arm of the White House and the Department of Defense to draft a proposal
that puts economic development at the center of base closure asset disposition. The NEC convened an interagency working
group that created the following framework for base disposal:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Where a ready market does not exist, make property available to the local redevelopment authority, without initial
cost, for economic development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Congress, mindful of the need to reform this process, endorsed the President's plan by authorizing Title XXIX
of Public Law 103&hyph;160, Base Closure Communities Assistance, the so-called ``Pryor Amendment''. Based largely
on legislation sponsored by Senator Pryor, the provisions of Title XXIX provide the legal authority to carry out the
President's plan by, among other things, authorizing conveyances of real and personal property at or below fair market
value to local redevelopment authorities, and sharing of profits on subsequent sales and leases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;160 required the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations to implement the provisions
of the law. This is being accomplished under the Administrative Procedures Act which allows for the public to comment
on the regulations. Due to the need to begin acting on the proposed regulations, the Department of Defense has issued
them as interim final rules which allow actions at closing bases to begin before the regulations are made final after
the public comment period. The section related to the conveyance of property in consideration of environmental restoration
costs, is issued as a proposed rule and cannot be exercised until a final rule is published following public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Real Property Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Department of Defense no longer needs to retain real property at a closing base, the Department is required
to dispose of the property in accordance with the prescribed screening process in the General Services Administration
property disposal regulations and the new expedited process authorized in Title XXIX. This process permits DoD entities,
other Federal Agencies and homeless providers to identify property they would like to acquire when the base closes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The screening process for real property requires the Department of Defense to identify first what it needs to retain.
Any property excess to the Department of Defense is then made available to other Federal Agencies. Property not needed
by other Federal Agencies is then identified as surplus and reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) for a determination of suitability for homeless use and publication of such properties in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Property that has no homeless interest, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will
then be available for transfer by either direct sale to the public, negotiated conveyance to the local redevelopment
authority, public benefit conveyances for airports, schools, ports, etc., or the new economic development conveyance
discussed in paragraph 5. of this summary. The Military Departments will work with the other Department of Defense
Components, Federal Agencies, homeless providers and reuse planners, early in the closure process, to sort out these
requests. This new process will provide for the early identification of property which will become available for
reuse. This information is critical to the local redevelopment authority's ability to design a realistic redevelopment
plan. Agreement with proposed uses, other than for McKinney Act homeless use, is at the discretion of the Military
Departments who have been delegated disposal authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. McKinney Act Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is a statute designed to permit recognized providers of assistance
to the homeless to receive a high priority in acquiring unneeded land and buildings on Federal properties. Buildings
and land on closing bases provide excellent opportunities for homeless providers to acquire the infrastructure
they need to establish their programs. This section of the interim final rule describes the new process, specifically
tailored for base closure properties, that will expedite the screening process with homeless providers and will
result in the early identification of their needs. The expedited screening process will be pursued in a proactive
manner. The Military Departments will work with communities to identify eligible entities and conduct timely outreach
seminars to educate homeless providers with respect to the land and buildings that will be made available and the process
for making a formal application to HHS to acquire such land and buildings. The early identification of homeless assistance
requirements will permit communities to develop reuse plans that fully accommodate homeless needs, while permitting
early identification of the remaining property for quick sale to create jobs, a Federally-sponsored public benefit
conveyance, or conveyance to a local redevelopment authority for economic development purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Local Redevelopment Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The early formation of a local redevelopment authority is critical to the successful reuse of the base. The primary
focus of the local redevelopment authority should be developing a comprehensive local redevelopment plan. This
plan should embrace the range of feasible reuse options that will result in rapid job creation. The local redevelopment
plan will generally be used as the proposed action when the disposing Military Department conducts the environmental
analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Jobs-Centered Property Disposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new property disposal process described in this section and in paragraphs 5. and 6. of this summary, is designed
to rapidly create new jobs. In most cases, that will occur through conveyances for economic development, without
initial cost, as described in paragraph 5. However, in a few cases, an entire base or a substantial portion of it will
have a high value and hence a ready market for development. In such cases, market sale of the property may be the most
effective way to rapidly create new jobs.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Military Department will identify properties having a ready market and begin the appraisal process as soon as
possible but not later than 6 months after completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process in paragraph
2. of this summary. The appraisals should take into consideration uncertainties and the associated risks in property
development as well as the impact of the base closure on market conditions. Moreover, the appraisal will reflect the
most likely range of uses consistent with local interests rather than highest and best use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in determining the estimated fair market value, the Military Departments will solicit for expressions
of interest for the entire or a substantial portion of the base for a period no longer than 6 months. The results will
be shared with the local redevelopment authority. Expressions of interest will be solicited simultaneously with
other screening and disposal actions and will not cause a delay in the disposal process. The Military Departments
will analyze each expression of interest and determine if it represents a reasonable proposal that is likely to lead
to rapid development and job creation. If after consulting extensively with the local community, the Military Department
makes a favorable determination, the Department may decide to offer the property for sale. The local redevelopment
authority will be promptly notified of the decision and may challange the decision. If the Military Department nevertheless
decides to proceed with the sale, potential bidders will be strongly encouraged to work with the local redevelopment
authority so that their proposals are compatible with the local redevelopment plan. Identifying a substantial portion
of the base for sale, however, does not preclude the community's acquisition of the property through a negotiated
sale with the Department of Defense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that a base or substantial portion thereof, is identified as potentially valuable but does not sell due
to the absence of a ready market, the property will then be available for conveyance for public benefit or, economic
development purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout this process, the Military Departments will make maximum effort to give community considerations a high
priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Economic Development Conveyances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Closing military bases often have a great deal of land that may not be readily developable or marketable due to its location.
Additionally, closing bases often have buildings that may need to be demolished in order to encourage redevelopment
and economic revitalization. Historically, the process of selling bases, or parts thereof, for fair market value
has been time consuming and the proceeds from the few sales of base closure properties have been less than originally
anticipated. In the past, the law permitted the Department of Defense to convey property at a discount of up to 100 percent
(free of charge) for specific public purposes such as health, aviation, recreation, and education_but not for economic
development. The new authority permits the DoD to convey land and buildings to redevelopment authorities initially
for free, after it is determined that the base, or significant portions thereof, cannot be sold in accordance with
the rapid job creation concept. Such conveyances may help induce a market for the property, thereby, enhancing economic
recovery. Redevelopment authorities requesting an economic development conveyance, shall submit a simple written
request containing four basic elements as described in the interim rule. Generally, installations will be conveyed
at no initial cost with a recoupment provision that will permit the Department of Defense to share in any future profits
should the base be later leased or sold. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed under this authority at no cost and with
no recoupment if they meet the standards as detailed in the interim rule. The conveyance for economic development
should be used by local redevelopment authorities to gain control of large areas of the base, not just individual buildings.
The income received from some of the higher value property should help offset the maintenance and marketing costs
of the less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide
an income stream to assist the long term development of the property.

6. Profit Sharing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When real property is conveyed as described in paragraph 5. of this summary, DoD shall generally share in the division
of future profits should the property be subsequently sold or leased. The division of profits shall be based on net
profits and the share shall generally favor the local redevelopment authority. There shall be a 15-year time limit
on the share of the profits. The government's portion of the receipts from the profit shall not exceed the estimated
fair market value of the property at the time of conveyance to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Leasing of Real Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Leasing of real property early in the reuse process is an effective way to quickly attract new jobs to replace those
that have been lost by the base closing. In the past, the requirement to lease at fair market value discouraged the creation
of new jobs. The new leasing process, at less than fair market value, will provide new incentives for redevelopment
authorities and businesses alike to spur job creation and speed economic redevelopment. Inasmuch as the Department

suitable economic reuse to occur on substantial portions of closing bases.

8. Personal Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal property located on closing bases is often very useful to the redevelopment of the real property. This section
of the interim final rule outlines procedures to allow transfer of personal property with the real property in many
cases. It provides for completing an inventory soon after the base is approved for closure and consultation with local
officials. This consultation may include a walkthrough of the base to familiarize local officials with potentially
available property. The community can then identify the personal property it wishes to retain in its redevelopment
plan. The Department of Defense will keep a great deal of the personal property at the base while the redevelopment
plan is being put together. Only valid exemptions will be made to this freeze, usually involving specific military
requirements or property which the base does not own. Emissions trading procedures will be issued separately and
are not covered by the interim final rule.

Facilities and equipment located on closing bases are often important to the eventual reuse. This section of the interim
rule below provides procedures to protect their condition while the redevelopment plan is being put together. The
level of maintenance will be determined in consultation with the redevelopment authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense has determined that this interim rule is not a significant regulatory action, as defined
by Executive Order 12866. The rule does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities. It provides for transfer of paid-for federal installations no longer needed for economic
development purposes. This will benefit the economy and the communities in which the closing bases are located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12886. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been certified that this interim final rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because
the interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary
effect of the interim final rule will be to reduce the burden on local communities of the Government's property disposal
process at closing military installations and to accelerate the economic recovery of the relatively small number
of communities that will be affected by the closure of nearby military installations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act because it imposes no obligatory information requirements
beyond internal DoD use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is DoD policy to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Help communities impacted by base closures achieve rapid economic recovery through effective reuse of the assets
of closing bases_more quickly, more effectively and in ways based on local market conditions and locally developed
reuse plans_by implementing the President's Five-Part Plan that encourages:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Transferring real and personal property expeditiously to local redevelopment authorities and in ways that enhance
economic development and job creation or other public benefits. This can best be accomplished by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Making transfers of property to a redevelopment authority for economic development affordable, when necessary
to foster community redevelopment plans. The use of existing public benefit conveyances should be considered, where
appropriate, before the use of a public benefit conveyance for economic development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Accelerating the property screening process early in the disposal process to determine other potential Federal
uses of the property, including the identification of the needs of homeless providers. This will determine how much
of the property is available for early economic development and/or other community reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Informing communities, as early as possible after the base closure decision is final, if an installation will
be considered for ``economic development'' conveyances under Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, Title XXIX and will not be
offered for sale, instead. Such decisions shall be based on a determination that the existence of a ready market for
the property indicates that public or private developers can not be relied upon as the preferable mechanism to spur
economic redevelopment and the creation of new jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Encouraging interim leases at less than the estimated fair market value in order to facilitate State or local
economic redevelopment efforts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) Delegating authority to approve interim leases and simple land transfers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Considering the personal property requirements of the community redevelopment plan when making decisions
on the disposition of base equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Ensuring fast-track environmental cleanup of closing bases to permit earlier determination of property suitable
for either conveyance or lease. The key elements of this initiative are to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Establish a base realignment and closure cleanup team composed of members from the Department of Defense, the
Environmental Protection Agency and State regulatory agencies, at every base where property is available for transfer
and reuse. The team shall prepare the base realignment and closure cleanup plan and make decisions to expedite the
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Quickly identify and document uncontaminated real property parcels to permit timely reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Identify opportunities to convey property quickly to those willing to pay the cost of cleaning up the contaminated
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Ensure analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190; 10 U.S.C. 4332 et. seq.)
process are produced in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Establish procedures for identifying and documenting parcels of real property that are environmentally suitable
for lease, even if needed mitigation precludes conveyance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Improve public involvement in the environmental cleanup by establishing and seeking public participation
in Restoration Advisory Boards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Providing full time base transition coordinators at major installations slated for closure or substantial realignment.
The principal functions of the coordinators shall be to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Assist in cutting through red tape on property disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Assist in keeping the environmental cleanup on a fast track.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Assist the DoD Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) in helping communities identify sources of Federal assistance
for developing and implementing economic redevelopment plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Providing easy access to transition and redevelopment help for workers and communities by targeting major sources
of Federal funding assistance to base closure communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Providing larger economic development planning grants to base closure communities. Planning grants should
be approved quickly. The Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment will move beyond the traditional
role of providing grants for planning to helping communities transition from planning to implementation by funding
a portion of the staff required for implementation of the local redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Follow the following framework in implementing Title XXIX of Pub. L. 103&hyph;160:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where a ready market exists, complete screening and then sell properties quickly for public or private development
to speed up job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where a ready market does not exist, make property available to the local redevelopment authority without initial
consideration, for economic development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Share the net profits between the Department of Defense and the local redevelopment authority if a property conveyed
without initial consideration for economic development is subsequently leased or sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This regulation does not create any rights or remedies and may not be relied upon by any person, organization, or
other entity to allege a denial of any rights or remedies other than those provided by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, Title XXIX.

It is DoD policy to help communities affected by base closures achieve rapid economic recovery through effective
reuse of the assets of closing bases_more quickly, more effectively and in ways based on local market conditions and
locally developed reuse plans. This will be accomplished by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Selling properties quickly for public or private development to speed up job creation where a ready market exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Making property available without initial consideration for economic development where a ready market does
not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Sharing the net profits between the DoD and the local redevelopment authority if a property conveyed without initial
consideration for economic development is subsequently sold or leased.

Procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Real property screening.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the Department of Defense no longer needs to retain real property, the Department is required to dispose of
the property in accordance with the prescribed screening process in the General Services Administration property
disposal regulations and the expedited process described in this part. This process permits DoD entities, other
Federal Agencies and homeless providers to identify property they would like to acquire when the base closes. The
Secretary concerned will work with the other DoD Components, Federal Agencies, homeless providers and reuse planners,
early in the closure process, to sort out these requests. This process will provide for the early identification of
property which will become available for reuse that is critical to the local redevelopment authority's ability to
develop a realistic reuse plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Military Departments should complete the internal DoD real property screening of closing and realigning
base property:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By April 1, 1994, for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Within 4 months of the date of approval of the 1995 closures and realignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Military Departments should seek local redevelopment authority input in making determinations on the retention
of property and should consider their input, if provided. Transfer of real property at closing and realigning bases
between any of the Military Departments, or retention of real property at a closing base by a Military Department,
must be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, unless such a transfer has already been
approved by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Formal screening of real property excess to the DoD with other Federal Agencies must be completed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By June 1, 1994, for 1988, 1991, and 1993 closures and realignments unless the community requests a postponement
of the surplus determination as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Within 6 months of the date of approval of the 1995 closures and realignments unless the community requests a postponement
as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) These timeframes afford Federal Agencies sufficient time to assess their needs, submit initial expressions
of interest to the Department of Defense, and apply for the property. During this period, Agencies sponsoring public
benefit conveyances should also consider the suitability for such purposes. The Military Departments should provide
other Federal Agencies as full and complete information as practicable on the property in the Notice of Availability.
Requests for transfers of property submitted by other Federal Agencies will normally be accommodated. Decisions
on the transfer of property to other Federal Agencies shall be made by the Military Department concerned in consultation
with the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Military Departments should make the notices of availability available to the local redevelopment authorities,
State and local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Within the 6 month screening period in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Military Departments shall consult
with the local redevelopment authority and make appropriate final determinations whether a Federal Agency has identified
a use for, or shall accept transfer of, any portion of the property. If no Federal Agency requests the property, the
property shall be declared surplus. However, the local redevelopment authority may request the Military Department
concerned to delay this final surplus declaration. All requests for delay must be in writing and made before May 1,
1994 for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments and within 5 months of the approval of the 1995 base closures
and realignments. If there is a Federal Agency request for transfer, the Secretary concerned may postpone the determination
to transfer and the Secretary may also postpone the determination of surplus for all or any part of the property at the
installation for such period as the Secretary concerned determines is in the best interest of the communities affected
by the closure of the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Screening of real property with State and local government agencies shall take place concurrently with McKinney
Act screening. The screening notice should state:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uses to assist the homeless shall take precedence unless the Secretary concerned or the Secretary of Health and Human
Services (HHS) determines that a competing request under 40 U.S.C. 484(k) is so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh
the needs of the homeless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Withdrawn public domain lands are those lands which have been transferred from the Department of Interior to a
Military Department for its temporary use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) These lands on closing or realigning bases are to be returned to the Secretary of Interior when the Secretary of
the Military Department concerned no longer has need for these lands, if they are still suitable for the programs of
the Secretary of Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Military Department concerned will notify the Secretary of Interior, normally through the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), when withdrawn public domain lands are included within an installation to be closed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The Bureau of Land Management will screen these lands within the Department of Interior to determine if these
lands are suitable for return to the Department of Interior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the lands are not suitable for the programs of the Secretary of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management will
so notify the Military Department and state that these lands should be processed as the other real property on the base.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Military Department will notify the Bureau of Land Management that it concurs with the determination and will
proceed in accordance with the real property screening procedures described in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) McKinney Act Screening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 11301), is a statute designed to permit
HHS-approved providers of assistance to the homeless to receive a high priority in acquiring unneeded land and buildings
on Federal properties. Buildings and land on closing bases provide excellent opportunities for homeless providers
to acquire the land and buildings they need to establish their programs. This section describes the new process specifically
tailored for base closure properties that will expedite the screening process with homeless providers and will result
in the early identification of their needs. The Military Departments will work with communities to identify eligible
entities and conduct timely outreach seminars to educate homeless providers with respect to the land and buildings
that will be made available and the process for making a formal application to the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS). The early identification of homeless assistance requirements for land and buildings at closing bases will
permit communities to develop reuse plans that fully accommodate homeless needs, while permitting early identification
of the remaining property for either quick sale for job creation, a federally sponsored public benefit conveyance
or conveyance to a local redevelopment authority for economic development purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is required to publish by February 15 of each year a list of
all the properties which were published in accordance with the McKinney Act in the previous calendar year. For the
purpose of reporting properties to HUD pursuant to the new expedited McKinney screening process described in this
section, the Military Departments should report only those properties which remain available as of the reporting
date. For the purposes of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which an expression of interest has been received by HHS from a
homeless provider, but a final HHS determination has not yet been made, shall be reported for screening under the new
procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which no expression of interest has been received by HHS from
a homeless provider and for which the Department of Defense has received no expression of interest or bona fide offer
in accordance with the provisions of section 501(c)(4)(C) of the McKinney Act, shall be reported in accordance with
the procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which no expression of interest has been received by HHS from
a homeless provider and for which the Department of Defense has received an expression of interest or bona fide offer
in accordance with the provisions of section 501(c)(4)(C) of the McKinney Act, shall not be reported in accordance
with the procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 1988 and 1991 base closure and realignment properties which remain available shall be reported to HUD in accordance
with the new expedited procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Under the new expedited McKinney Act screening process, the Military Departments shall sponsor a workshop or
seminar in communities having closing or realigning bases before reporting to HUD. All available property at closing
and realigning bases that will become surplus to Federal Agency needs will be reported to HUD:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By June 1, 1994, for the 1988, 1991, and 1993 closures and realignments, unless the community requests a postponement
of the declaration of surplus under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Within 6 months of the date of approval of the 1995 base closures and realignments unless the community requests
a postponement of the declaration of surplus under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) HUD shall make a determination of the suitability of each property to assist the homeless in accordance with the
McKinney Act. Within 60 days from the date of receipt of the information from the Department of Defense, HUD shall publish
a list of suitable properties that shall become available when the base closes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Providers of assistance to the homeless shall then have 60 days in which to submit to HHS expressions of interest
in any of the listed properties. If a provider indicates an interest in a listed property, it shall have an additional
90 days after submission of its written notice of interest to submit a formal application to HHS, a period which HHS
can extend. HHS shall then have 25 days after receipt of a completed application to review and complete all actions
on such applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) During the new expedited McKinney Act property screening process (from 60 to 175 days following 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
publication, as appropriate), disposal agencies shall take no final disposal action or allow reuse of property that
HUD has determined suitable and that may become available for homeless assistance, unless and until:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No timely expressions of interest from providers are received by HHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No timely applications from providers expressing interest are received by HHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) HHS rejects all applications received for a specific property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If no provider expresses an interest to HHS in a property within the allotted 60 days, the Military Department should
promptly inform the affected local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, the local governments, and
Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available
for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest
to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If there are expressions of interest by homeless assistance providers, but no application is received by HHS from
such a provider within the subsequent 90-day application period (or within the longer application period if HHS has
granted an extension), the Military Department should promptly inform the local redevelopment authority, the Governor
of the State, and Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property
will be available for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written
expression of interest to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan for the base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) If at any time during the 25 day HHS review period HHS rejects all applications for a specific property, the Military
Department should promptly inform the local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, and Federal Agencies
that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available for community
reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest to incorporate
the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan for the base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) During the allotted 1-year period for the local redevelopment authority to submit a written expression of interest
for the property, surplus properties not already approved for homeless reuse shall not be available for homeless
assistance, unless such homeless assistance is included in the local redevelopment authority's plan. The surplus
properties will also not be advertised by HUD as suitable during these 1-year periods. The surplus property may be
available for interim leases to any entity, including local redevelopment authorities as deemed appropriate by
the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(11) If the local redevelopment authority does not express in writing its interest in a specific property during the
allotted 1-year period, the disposal agency shall again notify HUD of the date of availability of the property for
homeless assistance. HUD may then list the property in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as suitable and available after the base closes following the previous McKinney Act procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The listing of base closure property from the 1991 and subsequent rounds of base closures reported to HUD shall
contain the following statement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The properties contained in this listing are closing or realigning military installations. This report is being
accomplished pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, section 2905(b). In accordance with section 2905(b), this property
is subject to a one-time publication under the McKinney Act, after which property not provided to homeless assistance
providers will not be published again unless there is no expression of interest submitted by the local redevelopment
authority in the one-year period following the end of the McKinney screening process pursuant to this publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) The list of 1988 base closure properties that will be reported to HUD shall contain the same statement as paragraph
(b)(12) of this section, and shall refer to section 2905(a) of the Act (107 Stat. 1916).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The early formation of a redevelopment authority is critical to the successful reuse of the base. The primary focus
of the redevelopment authority should be developing a comprehensive local redevelopment plan. This plan should
embrace the range of feasible reuse options that will result in rapid job creation. The local redevelopment plan will
generally be used as the proposed action in conducting environmental analyses required by the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Although the statute only requires the local redevelopment authority to submit a written expression of interest
within 1 year after the date the property is released from McKinney Act screening, the local redevelopment plan should
be prepared within that 1 year period. The plan should at a minimum identify:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Parcels recommended to be transferred to other Federal Agencies (whether or not a specific request for such transfer
was made by the Agency during the screening period) and their intended uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Parcels recommended to be transferred or conveyed for uses such as homeless assistance, public benefit purposes,
or other qualifying public purpose conveyance programs and their intended uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Parcels, and their intended uses, recommended to be conveyed by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Negotiated sale at estimated fair market value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Conveyance without initial consideration to local redevelopment authorities, with or without recoupment,
as provided in this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The plan should discuss how it will enhance the prospects for economic development and job creation, if the redevelopment
authority intends to request an economic development conveyance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Jobs-centered property disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The new property disposal process described in this section and in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section which
follow, is designed to rapidly create new jobs, either by taking advantage of a ready market for development of valuable
property or by inducing a market through conveyances for economic development, initially without consideration.
The procedures described below generally apply to 1993 and 1995 base closures and may not apply to 1988 and 1991 closures
which may be well along in the disposal process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The Military Departments should identify properties with potential for rapid job creation and begin, as soon
as possible, but not later than completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening (paragraph (b) of this section),
an appraisal or other estimate of the property's fair market value. Such appraisals or estimates should address a
range of likely market values taking into account: feasible uses for the property; the uncertainties in property
development; and, current market conditions (i.e., recognizing the state of the market after a closure announcement).
The appraisals should not be based on the replacement cost of the properties, since they may not be readily adaptable
for civilian use. Additionally, the appraisal should not be based on the highest and best use, but the most likely range
of uses consistent with local interests. The above appraisal may be accomplished for 1988 and 1991 closures if it is
determined that it would be beneficial to do so and will not delay the disposal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To assist in the appraisal/estimation of fair market value of properties with a potential for rapid job creation,
and to determine if interests exist in properties not originally identified for rapid job creation, the Military
Departments shall, for 1993 and 1995 closures, advertise for expressions of interest in all or any substantial part
of each closing installation. For the 1993 and 1995 closures, the Military Departments shall advertise at the completion
of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process (see paragraph (b) of this section). The Military Departments
may advertise for expressions of interest in all or any substantial part of each closing installation on the 1988 or
1991 closure lists if it is determined that it would be beneficial to do so and will not delay the disposal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Advertisements for expressions of interest shall be open for 6 months. Expressions of interest received should
detail the intended use, the site plan, the jobs estimated to be created, the schedule for development and hiring,
and an evaluation of the worth of the land and buildings. Expressions of interest will be shared with the local redevelopment
authority. Advertisements for expressions of interest will be conducted simultaneously with all other disposal
actions and are not an additional step in the disposal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Military Departments shall analyze each expression of interest and determine within 30 days of receipt if
it is made in good faith and represents a reasonable development proposal. If the Military Department decides that
an expression of interest received demonstrates the existence of a ready market, the prospect of job creation, and
offers proceeds consistent with the range of estimated fair market value, it may decide to offer the property for sale.
The property proposed for sale shall promptly be publicly identified, and the redevelopment authority shall be notified.
The redevelopment authority may request reconsideration of this decision under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
Potential offerors will be encouraged to work with the redevelopment authority so that their development goals will
be compatible with the local redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a redevelopment plan has not been completed, the redevelopment authority will be encouraged to include the
potential for sale of the property identified by the Military Department under paragraph (d)(3) of this section,
in the plan. The DoD Component will evaluate whether the potential sale of the identified property is covered by any
ongoing environmental analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Based on this evaluation,
consideration can be given to integrating the potential sale into the existing analyses or preparing additional
analyses required by law or otherwise deemed appropriate. The environmental impact statement shall, to the extent
practicable, be completed within 12 months, or a Finding of No Significant Impact issued within 6 months, of the public
announcement identifying the property proposed for sale.

(4) A few high value installations for which a ready market apparently exists may, nevertheless, not have generated
any expressions of interest during the allotted 6 month period. Regardless, such installations provide an opportunity
for private sector rapid job creation which should be pursued. In these cases, the Military Departments, based on
completed appraisals or other estimates of the fair market value, shall inform redevelopment authorities that the
property is expected to be offered for sale and an economic development conveyance should not be anticipated. Redevelopment
authorities shall be so informed as soon as possible, but not later than 6 months after completion of the McKinney Act
screening process. In making these determinations, airport, port, and school property may be excluded if it appears
that they are likely to be converted to public airports, ports or schools under existing public benefit conveyance
programs. The determination that an installation will be sold under paragraph (d)(4) of this section has 2 components:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The property must have a high value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There must be a ready market. Ready market means that offers to purchase at or near the estimated range of fair market
value from the private sector covering all or most of the installation could be expected within 6 months of advertising
the base for public sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Within 60 days of the announcement by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned of the intention to sell
property in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section, the authorized local redevelopment authority
may request, in writing, that this determination be reconsidered. The Secretary shall consider the request, provide
a final determination in writing to the local redevelopment authority and announce this determination publicly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Identification of an installation or property for sale under this section does not preclude a community's acquisition
of property for the estimated fair market value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments
because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed
to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases of 1988 and 1991 closures where this new property disposal
process is considered not appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding
with the disposition of the property.

Economic development conveyances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Closing military bases often have a great deal of land that may not be readily developable or marketable due to its
location. Additionally, closing bases often have buildings that may need to be demolished in order to encourage redevelopment
and economic revitalization. Historically, the process of selling bases, or parts thereof, for fair market value
has been time consuming and the proceeds from the sales of base closure properties have been less than originally anticipated.
In the past, the law permitted the Department of Defense to convey property at a discount of up to 100% (free of charge)
for specific public purposes such as health, aviation, recreation, and education_but not for economic development.
The new process that follows permits the DoD to convey land and buildings to redevelopment authorities with no consideration,
subject to recoupment, after it is determined that the base, or significant portions thereof, cannot be sold in accordance
with the rapid job creation concept. Such conveyances may help induce a market for the property, thereby, enhancing
economic recovery. Redevelopment authorities shall submit a simple written request containing four basic elements
as described in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(iv) of this section. Generally, installations will be conveyed
at no initial cost with a recoupment provision that shall permit DoD to share in any future profits should the base be
later leased or sold. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed under this authority with no recoupment if they meet the
standards in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The conveyance for economic development should be used by local redevelopment
authorities to gain control of large areas of the base, not just individual buildings. The income received from some
of the higher value property should help offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the less desirable parcels.
In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide an income stream to assist
the long term development of the property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) The Secretary of Defense is authorized by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, Section 2903 to convey real property at an installation
to be closed to the local redevelopment authority for economic development (an economic development conveyance).
The conveyance of property may be for consideration at or below the estimated fair market value, or without consideration.
The consideration, if any, can be paid in cash or in kind. Property to be transferred pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;160,
section 2903, will be conveyed with no consideration, subject to recoupment as described in paragraph (f) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The economic development conveyance authority is an addition to existing public benefit authorities and, generally,
should not be used when these public benefit authorities would apply. The Military Departments shall prepare a written
explanation why a transfer was made using this economic development conveyance authority for what appears to be a
purpose covered by an existing public benefit authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Before making an economic development conveyance of real property, an appraisal or other estimate of the property's
fair market value shall be made, based on the proposed reuse of the property. The Military Department shall consult
with the local redevelopment authority on appraisal assumptions, guidelines and on instructions given to the appraiser,
but shall be fully responsible for completion of the appraisal. When a property is conveyed for economic development
with no initial consideration, the Military Department shall prepare a written explanation why the estimated fair
market value was not received and retain it in their real property files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Property may be conveyed under Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160 to an authorized local redevelopment authority for economic
development following submission of a written request to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned disposing
of the property. The requests should contain the following elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Description of the property to be conveyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Statement of the local redevelopment authority's legal authority to acquire and dispose of property under the
laws of the governing State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A redevelopment plan that includes economic development and job creation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A statement explaining why existing public benefit conveyance authorities are not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Installations located in rural areas are of particular concern. An economic development conveyance may be made
without consideration and without recoupment in a rural area when the base closure will have a substantial adverse
impact on the economy of the local community and on the prospect of its economic recovery from the closure. To determine
whether a rural community is eligible for transfer under this section, the Secretary concerned shall first determine
whether the closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the prospect for economic recovery by determining whether
there is a market for the property. The closure may be determined to have substantial adverse impact if after advertising
for expressions of interest pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, no expressions of interest are received. No
expressions of interest to purchase the property signifies that public or private developers will not be able to provide
jobs and economic growth sufficient to provide timely recovery from closure without assistance. The second step
requires the Secretary concerned to make a determination that the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact
on the economy of the communities in the vicinity of the installation. In these cases, the base shall be offered to the
local redevelopment authority for conveyance without consideration and without recoupment (subject to paragraph
(f)(5) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments,
because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed
to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases where the new property disposal process is not appropriate,
the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding with the disposition of the property.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When real property is conveyed as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Department of Defense shall generally
share in the division of future profits should the property be subsequently sold or leased. The division of profits
shall be based on net profits and the share shall generally favor the local redevelopment authority. There shall be
a 15-year time limit on the share of the profits. The government's portion of the receipts from the profit shall not
exceed the fair market value of the property at the time it was conveyed to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Properties conveyed under the authority of Pub.L. 103&hyph;160, section 2903, to local redevelopment authorities
under an economic development conveyance that are subsequently sold or leased shall be subject to recoupment (profit
sharing) by the Department of Defense, except as provided in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. In the absence of a determination
by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned that a different division of the net profits is appropriate
because of special circumstances, the net profits shall be shared on a basis of 60 percent to the local redevelopment
authority and 40 percent to the Department of Defense. The purpose of this recoupment policy is to allow the local redevelopment
authority to benefit from the success of its efforts and from value created from zoning. Eliminating the requirement
for initial consideration also frees the local redevelopment authority's income stream for use in funding infrastructure
improvements needed to develop the property and increase its value. Sharing the profits, when they occur, will provide
a return to the taxpayers for the property they originally paid for, without unduly burdening the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total recoupment by the Government shall not exceed the fair market value of the property (or the top end of the
range of values) calculated at the time of conveyance to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The standard excess profits covenant promulgated by the General Services Administration (GSA) at 41 CFR 101&hyph;47.4908
shall be used as a model deed provision to implement this recoupment policy, recognizing that the GSA provision will
require tailoring for each parcel. The following changes and additions are required:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The deed provision will express the profit sharing established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, unless
explicitly modified by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The term of this deed provision in economic development conveyances will be 15 years unless released earlier
by the government upon satisfaction of the recoupment requirement. The disposing Military Department will provide
a statement, for use at any settlement, on the local redevelopment authority's compliance with the deed provision.
The Military Department will formally release the provision when the government has received its share of the sale
proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The deed provision will forbid ``straw'' transactions (sales or leases to a cooperating party at a nominal price),
transactions at other than arm's length, and other devices designed to circumvent the Government's recovery of its
share of the net profits. The purpose of this clause of the deed provision is to provide a basis for the government to
intervene if it appears that a transaction may adversely affect its interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In calculating the amount of any net profit from a sale or lease, the local redevelopment authority may include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Capital costs, as provided in 41 CFR 101&hyph;47.4908(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Direct and indirect costs related to the particular property and transaction that are otherwise allowable under
48 CFR part 31 including the allocable costs of operation of the local redevelopment authority with regard to that
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The annual report required by the GSA provision will be deleted, and a clause requiring notification to the disposing
Military Department of sales or leases will be substituted. The notice of sale or lease will be accompanied by an accounting
or financial analysis indicating the net profit, if any, from a sale, or the estimated annual profit from a lease. The
accounting or financial analysis, and any other aspect of a transaction by the local redevelopment authority with
respect to property transferred under this part, is subject to Department of Defense audit.

revenues from a conveyance under this section when such settlement is requested by the redevelopment authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments,
because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed
to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases where the new property disposal process is not appropriate,
the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding with the disposition of the property.

Leasing of real property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Leasing of real property is an effective way to quickly attract new jobs to replace those that have been lost by the
base closing. In the past, the requirement to lease at fair market value discouraged the creation of new jobs. The new
process of leasing, at less than fair market value, where appropriate, will provide new incentives for redevelopment
authorities and businesses alike to spur job creation and speed economic redevelopment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretaries of the Military Departments are authorized by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, section 2906 to lease real
and personal property at closing or realigning bases for consideration of less than the estimated fair market value,
if the Secretary concerned determines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That a public interest will be served as a result of the lease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That securing the estimated fair market rental value from the lease is not compatible with such public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Military Departments shall determine the environmental suitability of property to be leased using the procedures
in the DoD policy entitled ``Procedures for Finding of Suitability to Lease (FOSL)'' contained in the Deputy Secretary
of Defense Memorandum,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 ``Fast Track Cleanup at Closing Installations'', September 9, 1993, and any amendments thereto. Regulatory consultation
(Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and State government) must be completed before entering into any leases,
as specified in the FOSL guidance and when approved, the Memorandum of Understanding between DoD and EPA will confirm
the FOSL process.

(4) The Military Departments are encouraged to redelegate leasing authority to the level that can best respond to
local redevelopment needs and still exercise prudent and consistent stewardship over these public assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Personal property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Personal property located on closing bases is often very useful to the redevelopment of the real property. This
section outlines procedures to allow transfer of personal property with the real property in many cases. It provides
for completing an inventory soon after the base is approved for closure, consulting with local officials, and a walkthrough
of the base. The community can then identify the personal property it wishes to retain in its redevelopment plan. The
Department of Defense will keep a great deal of the personal property at the base while the redevelopment plan is being
put together. Only valid exemptions will be made to this freeze, usually involving specific military requirements
or property which the base does not own. Emissions trading procedures will be issued separately and are not covered
by the part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each Military Department and Defense Agency, as appropriate, shall take an inventory of the personal property,
to include its condition, at closing or realigning bases as early in the closure process as possible. At realigning
bases, the inventory shall be limited to the personal property located on the real property to be disposed of by the
Military Department or Defense Agency. The purpose of the inventory is to identify personal property_any property
except land, fixed-in-place buildings, ships, and Federal records_that could enhance the reuse potential of real
property that may be conveyed to the local redevelopment authority for supporting the economic redevelopment of
the base. The exempted categories of personal property listed in paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall not be subject
to review by the community. The inventory must be completed by June 1, 1994, for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments
or within 6 months after the date of approval of 1995 closures.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) The inventory shall be taken in consultation with local redevelopment authority officials. If no local redevelopment
authority exists, consultation shall be offered to the local government in whose jurisdiction the installation
is wholly located, or a local government agency or State government agency designated for the purpose of such consultation
by the chief executive officer of the State. Based on these consultations, the base commander is responsible for determining
the items or category of items potentially enhancing the reuse of the real property and needed to support the redevelopment
plan. When the inventory is completed, base personnel shall offer a ``walkthrough'' with representatives of the
local redevelopment authority so that they can see the type and condition of the property available for reuse. Disagreements
should be resolved within the chain-of-command, with final authority on resolving personal property issues resting
with the Secretary of the Military Department or Defense Agency Director responsible for the real property. This
authority may be further delegated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Military Departments should make every reasonable effort to assist affected communities in obtaining the
personal property needed to convert the bases into economically-viable enterprises. Personal property not subject
to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall remain at a closing or realigning base until one of the following
time periods expire (whichever comes first):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One week after the date on which the redevelopment plan is submitted to the applicable Military Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date on which the local redevelopment authority notifies the applicable Military Department that a plan
will not be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Twenty-four months after the dates referred to in paragraph (h)(2) of this section which for 1988, 1991 and 1993
base closures and realignments is November 30, 1995, or 24 months after the date of approval of the 1995 closures and
realignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Ninety days before the date of the closure or realignment of the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Personal property may be removed without regard to these time periods upon approval of the base commander, or higher
authority within the Military Department, and after notice to the local redevelopment authority, if the property:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is required for the operation of a unit, function, component, weapon, or weapon system transferring to another
installation. A transferring unit or function may take with it any property needed to function properly as soon as
it arrives, provided that suitable replacement equipment will not be readily obtainable there and moving it is cost-effective.
In addition to this authority for the transferring unit or function to remove personal property, the major command
having jurisdiction over the installation (e.g., the Army's Forces Command or the Air Force's Air Combat Command),
or the major claimant having jurisdiction over the installation (e.g., the Navy's U.S. Atlantic Fleet) also may remove
property that is needed immediately and is indispensable to an organization under its jurisdiction at another installation
for carrying out the organization's primary mission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is uniquely military in character, and is likely to have no civilian use (other than use for its material content
or as a source of commonly used components). Classified items; nuclear, biological, chemical items; weapons and
munitions; museum property or items of significant historic value that are maintained or displayed on loan; and similar
military items fit this exception.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is not required for the reutilization or redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the Military
Department concerned and the redevelopment authority).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Is stored at the installation for distribution (including spare parts or stock items). This exception includes
materials or parts used in a manufacturing or repair function but does not include maintenance spares for equipment
to be left in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Meets known requirements of an authorized program of another Federal Department or Agency for which expenditures
for similar property would be necessary, and is the subject of a written request received from the head of the Department
or Agency. In this context, ``expenditures'' means the Federal Department or Agency intends to obligate funds in
the current quarter or next six fiscal quarters. The Federal Department or Agency must pay packing, crating, handling,
and transportation charges associated with such transfers of personal property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Belongs to nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI). NAFI property may be removed at the Military Departments'
discretion, because NAFI property belongs to the Service members collectively and is not government property. Therefore,
it may not be transferred to the local redevelopment authority under this section. Separate arrangements for communities
to purchase NAFI property are possible and may be negotiated with the Military Department concerned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Personal property to be transferred to the local redevelopment authority in support of its redevelopment plan
is not subject to sections 202 and 203 of Public Law 81&hyph;152, ``Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act of 1949, as amended'' of June 30, 1949, 40 U.S.C. 483&hyph;484. If the real property is transferred without consideration,
the personal property shall also be transferred without consideration. If the real property is transferred at or
near estimated fair market value, the value of the personal property shall be included in the estimated fair market
value of the real property. If the property is conveyed separately from the real property, the value of the personal
property shall be that at which it is carried on the installation's property account or estimated fair market value
as agreed to between the parties at the time of transfer.

(7) In addition to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section, the Military Department or Defense Agency is
authorized to substitute an item similar to one requested by the redevelopment authority. The substitute items may
be drawn from another installation or from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service. It is the responsibility
of the Military Department or Defense Agency that owns the property to find a similar item that may be suitable as a substitute.
In this context, ``similar'' means the original and the proposed substitute item are designed and constructed for
the same specific purpose. However, before substituting another item for the one being requested, the base commander
shall consult with the redevelopment authority.

(8) Personal property that is not needed by a major command (or its subordinates), a Federal Agency, or a local redevelopment
authority (or a State or local jurisdiction in lieu of a local redevelopment authority) shall be transferred to a Defense
Reutilization and Marketing Office for processing in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 483 et seq.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Facilities and equipment located on closing bases are often important to the eventual reuse. This section provides
procedures to protect their condition while the redevelopment plan is being put together. The level of maintenance
will be determined in consultation with the redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 2902 states that the Secretary may not reduce the level of maintenance and repair
of facilities or equipment at the installation below the minimum levels required to support the use of such facilities
or equipment for nonmilitary purposes, except when the Secretary of the Military Department concerned determines
that such reduction is in the National Security interest of the United States. This requirement remains in effect
until one of the time periods in paragraph (h)(4) of this section has expired.

(3) The initial minimum level of maintenance and repair to support non-military purposes shall be determined during
consultation between the Military Department and the redevelopment authority. This level and the property to which
it applies shall be reviewed with the local redevelopment authority when it presents its final development plan.
Where agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of the Military Department concerned shall determine the level
of maintenance required. In no case shall the level of maintenance and repair:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Exceed the standard at the time of approval of the closure or realignment.

(ii) Require any improvements to the property to include construction, alteration, or demolition, except that required
by environmental restoration.

(4) The negotiated minimum maintenance agreement must be tailored to the specific non-military uses, but shall include
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Maintaining the facilities and equipment that are likely to be utilized in the near term at a level that shall prevent
undue deterioration and allow transfer to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Overview of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Implementation of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) was directed by Congress in section 4408 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;484, which amended title 10, United
States Code, by adding section 1078a. This law directed the implementation of a program of temporary continued health
benefits coverage for certain former beneficiaries of DoD, comparable to the health benefits provided for former
civilian employees of the Federal government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress also directed the program start by October 1, 1994, and replace the conversion health care programs authorized
in section 1086a and 1145(b) of title 10. Conversion health care is provided via a Department of Defense (DoD) contract
with Mutual of Omaha and is scheduled to end September 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status directs that the benefits offered by the CHCBP must be comparable to those offered to former civilian employees
of the Federal government. As is the case for those employees, the costs will be borne by the beneficiary who will pay
the entire premium charge. Additionally, the DoD is permitted to charge up to an additional ten percent of the premium
charge to cover administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4408(b), eligibility to enroll in the CHCBP includes members of the uniformed services who are discharged
or released (voluntarily or involuntarily as long as not under adverse conditions) and their dependents; certain
unremarried former spouses of a member or former member; and emancipated children.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health care coverage in the CHCBP is for a specific time period, which varies by the category of beneficiary. Coverage
periods are as follows: Former uniformed services members and their dependents_up to 18 months; unremarried former
spouses_up to 36 months; emancipated children (age 21 if not in college or up to age 23 if in college)_up to 36 months.
Eligible beneficiaries generally will have 60 days to elect coverage after they are notified of their opportunity
to enroll.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Defense considered three alternatives to implement this program: first, integration of the program
within the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) health care plans under arrangement with the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM); second, competitive procurement of a private insurer to administer this program; and
lastly, continued CHAMPUS-type coverage, paid for by the beneficiary, with a third party administrator collecting
the premiums and performing eligibility and verification functions. The first option was rejected based on the difficulties
of making the transition from a DoD administered benefit to an OPM program. The second option was not selected based
on the likelihood that an acquisition process involving a beneficiary group of such unpredictable size and characteristics
would not result in a vendor willing to underwrite this program. Contractors would be wary that health care costs would
exceed the capped premium. Thus, we propose to offer this program directly through the established mechanisms of
CHAMPUS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under this approach, beneficiaries will continue to make use of existing CHAMPUS rules and administrative structures
to receive their medical care and have medical claims paid. This feature will allow enrollees to make use of discounts
and reduced copayments and provider arrangements already part of CHAMPUS in some locations. As previously noted,
a third party administrator (TPA) will act as a central agent for the program. The functions of this TPA will be to: receive
applications for enrollment of beneficiaries; verify eligibility and approve enrollment; notify the Defense Enrollment
and Eligibility Reporting Systems (DEERS) of enrollment; collect premiums; and provide administrative services.
CHCBP eligibles will obtain information concerning the program and the application process and other TPA functions
at their local base transition office or through the nearest military treatment facility's (MTF) Health Benefits
Advisory (HBA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that premium rates for this program will be comparable to the premium rates of a mid-range Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO) offered in the FEHBP. The Department of Defense has contracted with a private sector actuarial
firm to help develop premium rates. It is anticipated these rates will include individual and family premiums, but
will not be age/sex adjusted. (Similar to FEHBP premium schedules). Premium rates for fiscal year 1995 are currently
being calculated, however, it is expected that these quarterly rates will be in the range of $250 self and $625 for family.

II. Rulemaking Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires certain regulatory assessments for any ``significant regulatory action,'' defined
as one which would result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or have other substantial impacts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires that each Federal agency prepare, and make available for public comment,
a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulation which would have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is not a significant regulatory action under the provisions of Executive Order 12866, and it would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule will impose additional information collection requirements on the public under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 USC 3501&hyph;3511), because beneficiaries will be required to enroll. Request for approval
and review has been submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a proposed rule. Public comments are invited. All comments will be considered. A discussion of the major issues
received by public comments will be included with issuance of the final rule, anticipated approximately 60 days after
the end of the comment period.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CHCBP is a premium based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to qualified beneficiaries
(set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered
via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator.
The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules
and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for DoD
beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to
be part of CHAMPUS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993. The revisions concern a rule from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District
(SMAQMD). This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of
approving this rule is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rule controls VOC emissions from aerospace assembly
and coating operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of this revision into the California SIP under provisions
of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards
and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 4, 1993 at 58 FR 51591, EPA proposed to approve SMAQMD Rule 456, Aerospace Assembly and Component Coating
Operations, into the California SIP. Rule 456 was adopted by SMAQMD on February 23, 1993 and submitted by the California
Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on April 6, 1993. This rule was submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the
CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology
(RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act.
A detailed discussion of the background for the above rule and nonattainment area is provided in the proposed rule
cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the proposed rule cited
above. EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions
and evaluations has been provided at 58 FR 51591 and in a technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region
IX office (TSD for SMAQMD Rule 456 dated August 8, 1993).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 26, 1988, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control submitted a revision to
the Delaware State implementation plan (SIP) to achieve and maintain the national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10). The revision consists of: (1) Regulation 1_``Definitions and Administrative
Principles''; (2) Regulation 3_``Ambient Air Quality Standards''; (3) Regulation 15_``Air Pollution Alert and
Emergency Plan''; and (4) Regulation 25_``Requirements for Preconstruction Review''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The April 26, 1988 submittal also contained revised cutpoints for the motor vehicle exhaust emissions testing program
in Delaware and a newly-adopted volatile organic compound (VOC) control regulation for equipment leaks at synthetic
organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) facilities. The former was addressed under a separate rulemaking
at 55 FR 3402. The latter is also being addressed under a separate rulemaking. This notice will address only that portion
of the State of Delaware's April 26, 1988 submittal pertaining to PM&hyph;10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 26, 1988 submittal is consistent with the SIP revision requirements for PM&hyph;10 Group III areas as detailed
in the July 1, 1987 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (52 FR 24672). The amended Delaware regulations are consistent with the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10, and specify:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PM&hyph;10 as an indicator of particulate matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;exceedance levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of SIP Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) (52 FR 24634). The PM&hyph;10 standards replace
the total suspended particulate (TSP) standards promulgated by EPA in 1971. Also on July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated
changes to the policies and regulations by which it will implement the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52
(52 FR 24672).

Using the classification criteria established at 52 FR 24672, EPA has preliminarily designated areas within each
State as Group I, II, or III based upon an area's probability of attaining the PM&hyph;10 standard. The July 1, 1987

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice requires State implementation plan (SIP) revisions for all classified Group I, II, and III areas and indicates
the SIP revision requirements for each classification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 7, 1987, the State of Delaware was classified at 52 FR 29383 as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Group III_The entire State of Delaware.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments) did not affect the requirements established for Group III areas. The

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires States to seek approval of SIP revisions as required under the preconstruction review program and to codify
other minor regulatory changes as needed. It is presumed that the existing Delaware SIP is adequate to demonstrate
attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in all Group III areas in the State. On April 26, 1988, the State
of Delaware responded to the July, 1, 1987

EPA Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated Delaware's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The amended regulations conform

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to Delaware's regulations have been effective in the State
since March 29, 1988. This action will be effective June 6, 1994 unless, by May 6, 1994, notice is received that adverse
or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective
date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another
will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments
are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 6, 1994.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the four (4) regulations submitted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control as a revision to the Delaware SIP. EPA's review of this material indicates that it conforms to the requirements
of 40 CFR parts 51 and 52, and to the July 1, 1987 promulgation of NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action
conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 6, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)
of the Clean Air Act.)

evidence of carcinogenicity was observed based on a statistically significant increasing trend for benign liver
cell tumors in male rats and a statistically significant increasing trend for ovarian tubular adenomas in female
rats. A re-evaluation of the ovarian neoplasia data indicated that there was no statistically significant, dose-related,
trend in the incidence of ovarian tumors in female rats. This study is discussed further below.

 assay. A Dominant Lethal Study to further evaluate the mutagenic mechanism is due March 5, 1995 (2 years after the date
of the initial conditional registration of dimethenamid under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide
Act [FIFRA]).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has concluded that the available data provide limited evidence of carcinogenicity for dimethenamid in
rats and has classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence
of carcinogenicity in animals) in accordance with Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 1986 (51 FR 33992). Based on a review by the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of
the Office of Pesticide Programs, the Agency has determined that a quantitative risk assessment is not appropriate
for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The tumor response was primarily due to a significantly increasing trend for benign and/or malignant liver tumors
in males and due to a significantly increasing trend for ovarian tubular adenomas in female rats. A re-evaluation
of the ovarian neoplasia data indicated that there was not a statistically significant, dose-related, trend in the
incidence of ovarian tumors in female rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to mice at dose levels ranging from 30 to 3,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evidence, EPA concludes that dimethenamid poses at most a negligible cancer risk to humans and that for
purposes of risk characterization the Reference Dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk.
Residues of dimethenamid will not concentrate in processed soybean commodities and a food or feed additive regulation
is not required for dimethenamid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard risk assessment approach of using the RfD based on systemic toxicity was applied to dimethenamid. Using
a hundredfold safety factor and the NOEL of 5 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2&hyph;year
rat feeding study, the RfD is 0.05 mg/kg/day. The Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) from the established tolerances
is 0.000003 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 0.007 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population. The proposed use on
soybeans would contribute an additional 0.000068 mg/kg/day, raising the ARC to 0.000071 mg/kg bwt/day, or 0.14 percent
of the RfD. The exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population did not utilize a significantly greater
amount of the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tolerances have been previously established for dimethenamid in corn grain, corn fodder and corn forage. The metabolism
of dimethenamid in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable expectation of secondary residues occurring
in meat, milk and eggs from the tolerance associated with this petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead
time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical
Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide
enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C),
Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location
and telephone number: Room 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;5937).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS amends its regulations to allow importers or brokers to file ``Fisheries Certificates of Origin,'' which are
required for importation of certain fish and fish products, using the U.S Customs Service's Automated Broker Interface
(ABI) system. The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate excess paperwork and minimize the reporting burden, while
maintaining an efficient, accurate system to monitor the importation of the regulated fish and fish products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has implemented the use of the NOAA Form 370 ``Fisheries Certificate of Origin'' (FCO) to monitor the importation
of those fish and fish products specified by regulation to implement the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;711)(MMPA),
the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;627, Title IX) (DPCIA), and the International
Dolphin Conservation Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;523)(IDCA). These laws reflect the policy of the U.S. Government to ameliorate a worldwide environmental
crisis in which marine mammals and other marine life are killed by commercial fishing technology, such as large-scale
driftnets and purse seine nets deployed to encircle dolphins. The FCO provides the U.S. Customs Service (USCS) a tool
to monitor and deny entry of those fish products that are prohibited entry into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published a proposed rule, with a request for comments, on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60829), in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to amend the regulations to allow importers or brokers to file the FCO using the USCS's Automated Broker Interface
(ABI). Filing with the ABI would allow electronic filing of importation documentation without submission of the
paper forms. There were no comments received on the proposed rule. The final rule is substantially identical to the
proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule advances USCS's long-range plan to automate the importation process with the goal of eliminating
unnecessary paperwork. NMFS has requested, and USCS has agreed, to incorporate the FCO into the ABI system. USCS has
agreed to collect the information and to make the information available to NMFS by electronic transfer. The ABI system
for the FCO will not be ready until the second quarter of 1994. Many details still need to be worked out before initiating
electronic filing of the FCO. Recognizing this, NMFS is structuring its regulations to accommodate both the existing
paper system and the future electronic filing of the FCO. To facilitate the conversion to electronic filing, the final
rule will permit electronic filing at any and all points of entry where the ABI system is or may become available. After
the ABI system is implemented for the FCO, importers will have the option to file electronically or submit the paper
FCO upon entry. If an importer is unable to participate in the electronic filing system, the paper FCO can still be used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importers or their brokers will be required to maintain documentation to verify electronic entries for a period of
5 years after the entry. Any FCOs from foreign exporters, invoices, ``dolphin safe'' certification, and all other
required documents must be maintained by the broker or importer. NMFS enforcement officers are allowed access to
these documents, upon request, for routine inspections and when investigating alleged violations of the MMPA or
``dolphin safe'' labeling violations.

This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. chapter
35. The collections-of-information requirements found at &sect;216.24(e)(3) have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget under control number 0648&hyph;0040. The public reporting burden for filing the Certificate
of Origin electronically is 24 minutes, and the recordkeeping requirement for maintaining the information is 5 minutes.
Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of the collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to: Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (See

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains EPA's final rule implementing the control of vehicle refueling emissions through the use
of vehicle-based systems. It applies to light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The rule applies to all fuels
used by a vehicle, and includes special provisions for vehicles/fuels judged to be inherently low in refueling emissions.
For light-duty vehicles, the requirements begin in the 1998 model year, and phase in over three model years. In the
1998 model year, 40 percent of each manufacturer's light-duty vehicles must meet the requirements. This increases
to 80 percent in the 1999 model year and rises to 100 percent in model years 2000 and later. A special provision for phase-in
is also included for small volume manufacturers of light-duty vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This requirement also applies to light-duty trucks. For light-duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 0&hyph;6000
lbs, the requirement begins in model year 2001 and phases-in over three model years at the same rate as applied to light-duty
vehicles. For light-duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6001&hyph;8500 lbs, the requirement commences
in model year 2004 and phases-in over three model years at the same rate as light-duty vehicles. The rule does not apply
to heavy-duty vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also establishes certification requirements covering test procedures for integrated and non-integrated
control system designs, a refueling emission standard of 0.20 g/gallon and other related certification requirements
and provisions. Finally, the rule contains enforcement provisions related to liability, Selective Enforcement
Auditing and nonconformance penalties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 19, 1987, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the control of vehicle refueling emissions (52 FR 31162). The proposal
described the need for these controls as well as the conclusions of an EPA study of gasoline marketing emissions comparing
the relative merits of the two available control technologies: Systems incorporated into the gasoline dispensing
pump system design (known as Stage II vapor recovery) and systems incorporated into the design of the vehicle (known
as onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR)) (see Public Docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07). Based on this study, along with
EPA's analysis and response to public comments published in documents separate from the NPRM (Evaluation of Air Pollution
Regulatory Strategies for Gasoline Marketing Industry_Response to Public Comments (II&hyph;A&hyph;20), Draft
Regulatory Impact Analysis: Proposed Refueling Emission Regulations for Gasoline-Fueled Motor Vehicles, Vols.
I and II) (II&hyph;A&hyph;18, 19), and technical support documents related to ORVR test procedure (II&hyph;A&hyph;08)
and ORVR vehicle safety (II&hyph;A&hyph;17), EPA proposed to require refueling emission control through ORVR systems.
The above mentioned studies are available in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11. All future references of this nature
can be found at the cited location in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11 unless otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the NPRM, EPA held a public hearing in October 1987, followed by an extensive public
comment period which closed in February 1988. Comments were analyzed by EPA and key issues were assessed. As a result,
EPA determined that the final rulemaking should be delayed pending the resolution of safety concerns expressed by
both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (part of the Department of Transportation (DoT))
and a number of the commenters. The final rule was further delayed when it became evident that Congress would address
issues concerning refueling controls in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Amendments revised section 202(a)(6) of the CAA to read as follows:

Within 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall, after
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicle-based (`onboard') systems for
the control of vehicle refueling emissions, promulgate standards under this section requiring that new light-duty
vehicles manufactured beginning in the fourth model year after the model year in which the standards are promulgated
and thereafter shall be equipped with such systems.

Subsequent to the enactment of the CAAA, EPA continued its consultation with DOT/NHTSA related to the potential safety
concerns regarding the implementation of vehicle-based refueling emission controls. In July 1991, NHTSA completed
an updated safety study entitled ``An Assessment of the Safety on Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery Systems''. On
September 3, 1991, EPA published an additional 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (56 FR 43682) releasing the NHTSA report for public review and seeking further comment on key issues involved
with ORVR controls, most notably on circumstances that had changed since the publication of the NPRM. The notice also
described and sought comment on a document entitled ``Summary of Changed Circumstances'', which discussed statutory
changes, technology development, and potential modifications to the refueling test procedure.

EPA held a public hearing on September 26 and 27, 1991, and public comments were received for 30 days thereafter. After
reviewing these comments, EPA continued its consultation with NHTSA. Based on the outcome of the consultation, EPA
determined that ORVR controls should not be required at that time. The Agency took this step because it concluded,
after consultation with NHTSA and after considering the conclusions of NHTSA's safety study, that ORVR controls
posed ``unreasonable'' safety risks relative to Stage II systems. A

 notice detailing the decision and the supporting rationale was published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13220). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's action was challenged by representatives of the petroleum refining, gasoline marketing, environmental and
consumer auto safety communities. They argued that section 202(a)(6) of the CAA created a non-discretionary duty
to promulgate ORVR standards for LDVs. The court agreed, holding that EPA had no choice but to promulgate such standards,
and that the entire safety analysis in the April 15, 1992 notice was flawed because of the comparison with Stage II technology,
a comparison not allowed by the text of the statute.

. at 261, 270. The court set aside the April 15, 1992 Agency action, and ordered EPA to promulgate regulations requiring
vehicle-based refueling controls on LDVs in accordance with the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners further moved the court for an order requiring EPA to issue ORVR requirements by a particular date.
Before the court ruled, EPA and the petitioners entered into a settlement agreement whereby the Agency agreed to promulgate
such rules by January 22, 1994 (58 FR 33813, June 21, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the court's decision, EPA published two

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices (May 27, 1993, 58 FR 30731 and June 17, 1993, 58 FR 33418) seeking public comment on the key issues that had changed
since the last public comment period. EPA also held a public hearing on these issues on July 22, 1993, and solicited
comments for 30 days thereafter. EPA has analyzed these additional comments, and has revised its proposed regulations
accordingly. To support this rule, two key documents, a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and a Summary and Analysis
of Comments have been completed and are available for review in the public docket.

The remainder of the document is divided into sections. Section II describes the various aspects of the rule as listed
in the Table of Contents above, and provides rationale for the approaches being implemented. Section III describes
the long and extended public participation in the rulemaking process and previous study. Section IV summarizes the
Regulatory Impact Analysis. Finally, sections V through X describe various aspects of the rule with regard to compliance
with various administrative requirements such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 202(a)(6) of the Act mandates that EPA promulgate requirements for new light-duty vehicles (LDVs) to be equipped
with ORVR systems. In the August 1987 NPRM, EPA proposed that ORVR requirements apply to LDVs and, in this rule, is finalizing
that LDV portion of the original NPRM, consistent with the statutory requirements. The model year, phase-in, certification
and other requirements for LDVs are discussed in sections B through F, below.

2. Extension of the ORVR Requirement to LDTs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the authority provided in Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is applying the ORVR requirement
to light-duty trucks (LDTs). EPA is finalizing portions of that proposal in today's rules. Each manufacturer's LDTs
will have to meet the refueling emission requirements under the phase-in schedule and compliance program for trucks
described in the Implementation section below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching this decision, EPA has conducted a detailed analysis of the need for and desirability of extending the
requirement beyond the LDV class. The analysis is detailed in the supporting Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) available
in the public docket. The key points are summarized below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the rule affects pollutants which ``cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger public health or welfare'' (Section 202(a)(1)). Hydrocarbons, as ozone precursors, have long been an
essential object of emission control strategies (both vehicles and non-vehicles). Ambient ozone is an irritant
that adversely affects pulmonary membranes, lung tissues, and lung functions, and is also associated with adverse
ecological effects. Refueling emissions also contain benzene, a Group A human carcinogen. The gasoline vapors themselves
also adversely affect public health and welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, and perhaps most compelling, is the large amount of refueling emissions which arise from these LDTs. In 1990,
trucks represented about 33 percent of the gasoline used by highway motor vehicles. Using American Automobile Manufacturers
Association (AAMA) figures, retail truck sales have increased at a compound annual rate of 4&hyph;5 percent over
the past ten years, and this growth is projected to continue well into the next century. This increase in sales and market
fraction has led to an increase in the gasoline used by trucks. The fraction of gasoline used by LDTs is projected to
increase to 37 percent by 2000 and continue at that level or higher in the future. Thus, the percentage of the refueling
emissions inventory attributable to LDTs is large and is expected to increase in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another way to look at the magnitude of the emissions from LDTs is the equivalent gram per mile (g/mi) emission rate
attributable to their uncontrolled refueling emissions. As shown in the RIA, taking into account Phase II RVP control
and the RVP effects of reformulated gasoline, the nationwide uncontrolled refueling emission rate during the ozone
season for LDTs is about 0.22 g/mi. These are large emission rates in contrast to those controlled by other strategies
being implemented under the 1990 CAAA and being considered by the states in their State Implementation Plans. A good
example is the Clean-Fuel Fleet requirements under section 246 of the CAA and the Low Emission Vehicle program being
implemented in California and perhaps in other states. In these cases the equivalent emission reductions are in the
range of 0.12 to 0.18 g/mile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, EPA believes that ORVR controls are technologically feasible for LDTs. Reports and other materials submitted
to the docket over the past several years as well as comments by the regulated industry indicate that prototype ORVR
systems have been installed on a number of passenger cars and light trucks (IV&hyph;A&hyph;06, IV&hyph;D&hyph;682,
680, 682, 685, 688, 864, 701, 712, 718, 719, 720, 721, IV&hyph;E&hyph;50, 73). As is now the case with evaporative control
systems, we anticipate that the control technology used for LDT ORVR systems will be very similar to that applied to
LDVs. Although there are some differences between LDV and LDT fuel systems (e.g., tank size in some larger LDTs), the
general fuel system concepts, designs, and configurations are very similar. In addition, vehicles in both classes
must meet the recently promulgated enhanced evaporative emission control requirements beginning in the 1996 model
year. As with LDVs, EPA anticipates that the same evaporative emission control technology can be applied to control
refueling emissions in LDTs. To ensure that the enhanced evaporative control system canister and purge system can
be applied to ORVR controls, EPA is applying the same refueling emission test procedure approach to LDTs as is being
applied to LDVs. The only significant design difference will be the need for some form of a fillneck seal. However,
with the anticipated liquid seal approach this requires at most a minor fillneck modification and does not involve
new hardware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there are vehicle-to-vehicle differences in fuel system designs, these affect both the evaporative and refueling
emission rates for a given vehicle/fuel system design. To EPA's knowledge there is nothing unique about the design
or function of LDT fuel systems relative to LDVs which would suggest that the test procedure approach being applied
to LDVs would not be equally effective for LDTs in accomplishing the goal of allowing the widespread use of integrated
enhanced evaporative/refueling emission control systems. Although uncertainty has been expressed, no commenter
provided data or even a substantiated argument to support the view that the test procedure modifications would not
be equally effective in facilitating LDT use of integrated enhanced evaporative/refueling control systems. In
fact, testing conducted by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC&hyph;APRAC Project VE&hyph;6) (IV&hyph;D&hyph;565)
and EPA (II&hyph;A&hyph;06) indicate no significant difference between LDV and LDT uncontrolled refueling emission
rates. As is the case for LDVs, the refueling test procedure approach described above should allow the widespread
use of integrated refueling/evaporative control systems for LDTs. Thus, since there is no problem with applying
enhanced evaporative control systems to LDTs, there should be no problem with integrated evaporative/ refueling
control systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefits of applying the ORVR requirements to LDTs exceed the costs of the requirement. Since EPA believes, and
the manufacturers' comments indicate, that most vehicles will use an integrated evaporative/refueling control
system, the incremental costs of LDT ORVR controls are relatively small. As detailed in the RIA, EPA's cost is comprised
of added hardware (mostly an improved vent/rollover valve and larger diameter vapor line) and short term development
costs (for emissions and safety certification, facility modification hardware/tooling modifications, and systems
engineering) minus the fuel recovery credit. The size of the fuel recovery credit depends on the amount of vapor captured.
This in turn depends on the fuel used, the emissions rate (g/gal), and the presence or absence of Stage II vapor recovery.
Taking all of these factors into account, and assuming Stage II controls in most of the ozone NAAs, the cost estimate
for LDTs/HDVs are shown below in Table 1.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was discussed above, LDTs represent over 33 percent of the nation's gasoline consumption. With the test procedure
and control system approach mentioned above, EPA expects that the in-use control efficiency of LDT ORVR systems will
exceed 95 percent. Incremental to Stage II controls, LDT ORVR controls would provide a nationwide average annual
emission reduction of 115,000 tons between 1998 and 2020. Reductions in NAAs with Stage II controls are large as well.
With no Stage II phase-out, the average annual emission reduction in the NAAs is 31,000 tons. If Stage II is phased out
when ORVR is in widespread use (2010), the average annual emission reduction in the NAAs attributable to LDT controls
increases to 68,000 tons. These incremental reductions in NAAs are large relative to the other control options available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is discussed below, reductions in refueling emissions have value in all areas of the country. However, the main
focus of the ORVR requirement is to provide ozone NAAs additional reductions to assist them in complying or maintaining
compliance with the ozone standard. Thus, the important areas to consider are those which are not now in compliance
with the ozone standard. At present there are 54 marginal or worse ozone NA areas, which represent about 54.9 percent
of the nationwide highway gasoline consumption. Of these 54 areas, about 43 now have, or are expected to have, Stage
II vapor recovery systems in place. Since ORVR controls are required on all LDVs, and Stage II vapor recovery is (or
will be) in place in most moderate or worse ozone NAAs, the key comparison to be made is (1) retaining Stage II controls
in the moderate or worse ozone NAAs solely for the purpose of controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions, versus (2)
requiring ORVR controls for LDTs and possibly HDVs, assuming the Stage II control that is or will be in place. This comparison
provides a worst case perspective on the LDT/HDV cost effectiveness, since benefits outside NAAs are ignored and
planned Stage II is assumed to continue after the ORVR requirement is promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is described in the RIA, EPA has conducted the analysis for both the Stage II retention and ORVR options. The cost
effectiveness of retaining Stage II solely for the purpose of controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions is about $3400
per ton. The cost effectiveness of the LDT ORVR controls incremental to the Stage II now in place is about $200 per ton
if Stage II is phased out when ORVR control is in widespread use (2010) and only about $700 per ton if Stage II is never
phased out. Under either scenario the cost effectiveness of the ORVR option is attractive. Thus, even with the Stage
II controls, it is more cost effective to require ORVR controls on LDTs than to retain Stage II solely for controlling
LDT/HDV refueling emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the VOC emission reduction benefits cited above, LDT ORVR controls have other benefits. These benefits
have not been considered in the calculations above, but would further enhance the attractiveness of LDT ORVR. LDT
ORVR controls would result in an average annual fuel savings equivalent to about 31 million gallons of gasoline per
year between the period 1998 and 2020 assuming no Stage II phase-out, and about 43 million gallons per year if Stage
II is phased out. In addition, there will be health benefits as a result of reductions in air toxic emissions. Best estimates
are the avoidance of 2&hyph;3 cancer incidences per year as a result of lower refueling benzene emissions. Additional
cancer avoidances are possible depending on the assumption regarding the toxicological impact of the remainder
of the constituents of the gasoline vapor. Reductions in potential non-cancer health effects and welfare benefits
such as reduced crop and material damage due to ozone would occur as well.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In summary, EPA has decided to implement ORVR controls for LDTs for several reasons: Their contribution to the VOC
inventory is significant and there is a need for additional VOC reductions to address air quality concerns, the control
is technologically feasible and inexpensive, there are additional valuable benefits, and, as discussed in the RIA,
the cost effectiveness is very attractive, especially when compared to other programs being implemented and under
consideration. The analysis shows that the cost effectiveness of implementing ORVR controls for LDTs is superior
to retaining Stage II controls for the same purpose. The overall benefit to cost ratio for LDT ORVR is about 1.5. If the
application of ORVR controls to LDVs and LDTs allows phaseout of Stage II controls in the future, the cost savings attributable
to Stage II operations/ maintenance which would no longer occur would make the average annual costs of ORVR controls
negative (an average annual savings of over $40 million). Based on the cost effectiveness analysis and benefit-cost
ratio, one could also justify implementing LDT ORVR controls incremental to Stage II controls. However, the long-term
retention of Stage II would seem problematic since it would be needed only for heavy-duty vehicles.

3. Heavy Duty Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require ORVR controls for all HDVs. However, as discussed below, this requirement is not
being finalized in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information available to EPA indicates that an HDV ORVR system would be conceptually similar to those applied LDVs
and LDTs and the initial costs should be relatively small. However, motor vehicle manufacturers have argued that
the design and production of ORVR systems for HDVs would be considerably more difficult than for LDVs and LDTs. Commenters
have maintained that the technological step from light-duty technology is greatest with regard to HDVs which have
the largest fuel tanks and different fuel/vapor system component designs and configurations than many smaller LDTs.
Comments regarding incomplete HDVs expressed concern that secondary manufacturers would improperly modify or
incorrectly complete the vehicle fuel system (which is usually not fully installed for incomplete HDVs) and perhaps
affect the proper function of the manufacturer-provided ORVR system. Concern was also expressed that secondary
manufacturers might not have the expertise to correctly install the ORVR systems in all cases. In each case the primary
manufacturer may have legal liability for potential problems. It is also worth noting that many HDVs are also produced
by the primary manufacturer as an incomplete HDVs, perhaps compounding the concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes the manufacturers' strong concerns about ORVR implementation issues that are unique to HDVs, and
agrees that in many cases the application of ORVR controls to HDVs would be more difficult than for LDTs. Oftentimes
the fuel and vapor control systems are differently configured than those on LDTs and the fuel tanks are larger and of
different design. The large number of commercial applications for HDVs leads to a larger number of unique body/chassis
designs (e.g., 12 passenger vans, crew cabs, long bed pick-ups, dual wheel axle trucks) and thus a larger number of
different fuel system configurations. Another significant difference is that the engine in the HDV would be certified
separate from the ORVR system and thus there are additional challenges in matching the canister purge provided by
the engine with the needs of each ORVR system. The manufacturers' comments discussed above lay out the special concerns
for incomplete HDVs, including potential legal liabilities for the primary manufacturer. Finally, it should be
noted that unlike LDVs and LDTs EPA is not aware of any prototype ORVR-equipped HDVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these concerns, the effort needed to implement LDV and LDT ORVR systems, the relatively small number of gasoline-fueled
HDVs, and the fact that the application of ORVR standards to HDVs is discretionary, EPA is not finalizing the portion
of the NPRM which applies to HDVs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Even without implementing HDV ORVR requirements at this time, the ORVR program still provides significant benefits.
When viewed as a percentage of sales, ORVR still applies to 91 percent of all gasoline-fueled trucks and 97 percent
of all gasoline-fueled vehicles. Similarly, control is still achieved over 86 percent of all gasoline-fueled truck
refueling emissions and 94 percent of all gasoline vehicle refueling emissions. Thus, EPA's final decision that
ORVR requirements are not required for these vehicles does not significantly reduce the effectiveness of the ORVR
program.

4. Applicability to California Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As discussed further in the summary and analysis of comments, today's final rule implements a federal standard applicable
to all vehicles sold in the United States. Based on the language in section 202(a)(6) of the Act, EPA considers refueling
emissions control to be an evaporative standard. Although California has motor vehicle standards in place for model
year 1998 and beyond, including evaporative emission standards, to date EPA has issued no section 209(b) waivers
which consider a federal ORVR refueling program when evaluating the protectiveness, in the aggregate, of those standards.
However, EPA interprets section 209(b)(3) to provide that once a section 209(b) waiver is granted, compliance with
the state program is deemed compliance with the federal program standards. (See 42 FR 3193, January 17, 1977). To the
extent that a new federal standard is established subsequent to a waiver, such standard will be considered in a waiver
reconsideration or future waiver request consideration. EPA is making no finding at this time how stringency, in
the ORVR context, may be considered in a waiver proceeding, should one occur. (It should be noted that EPA in this notice
is restating its consistent interpretation for the convenience of rulemaking participants, and does not intend
to reopen for reconsideration the issue of the effect of existing section 209(b) waivers on post-waiver regulations.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) staff has held one workshop to discuss the proper application of refueling
control (November 2, 1993). CARB is considering three courses of action: adopting the federal ORVR rule, adopting
a California-specific ORVR rule, test, or standard, or maintaining that California's current motor vehicle program,
taken in the aggregate, is at least as stringent as the federal program notwithstanding the lack of ORVR controls.
If California submits a waiver request for its evaporative emission control program applicable to model year 1998
or thereafter, which does not include federal ORVR requirements, EPA will decide at that time whether California's
motor vehicle program is at least as protective as the federal program.

5. Fuels Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the September 1991 and May 1993 notices, EPA specifically solicited comments on applying the ORVR requirements
to highway motor vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline. Consistent with EPA policy on fuel neutrality and
establishing a consistent set of requirements for all fuels, today's rule requires that LDVs and LDTs operating on
any fuels be capable of meeting the refueling emission standard described below. It applies to vehicles certified
under both 40 CFR part 86 and 40 CFR part 88. Although many commenters stated that the refueling standard should not
apply to vehicles operating on diesel fuels, the section 202(a)(6) requirement by its terms applies to all LDVs regardless
of the type of fuel used. (In contrast, section 202(k) requires evaporative emission controls only for ``gasoline-fueled
motor vehicles''.) However, EPA has attempted to tailor the refueling emission certification requirements to the
fuel used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of vehicles capable of operating on gasoline, alcohol, or gasoline/alcohol blends must show that
these vehicles comply when refueled with such fuels through testing as described later in this preamble. This requirement
applies to dedicated neat alcohol fuel vehicles and vehicles using alcohol blends. Bi-fuel or dual-fuel vehicles
must meet the requirements on both fuels. Flexible-fueled vehicles must meet the requirements on all fuel combinations.
At the present time the only alcohol fuel affected is methanol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a waiver of emission testing requirements is available for those vehicles/fuels which are considered to
be inherently low in refueling emissions. EPA believes that a general engineering evaluation approach is acceptable
for diesel vehicles and diesel fuels for several reasons. Diesel fuel today has a Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of less
than one pound per square inch (psi) (7 kPa) and diesel engines today do not raise the temperature of fuel in their tanks
substantially more than do gasoline engines (less than 130 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F under most conditions). For these reasons, the vapor space over the fuel in diesel tanks has a very low concentration
of fuel vapor compared to that in gasoline tanks and thus displacement refueling emissions are low. EPA thus expects
diesel fuel vehicles to meet the refueling emission standard without a control system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under this approach, the vehicle manufacturer's certification application must include a statement that there
is nothing about the vehicle, its fuel system, or fuel that is counter to EPA's assessment as discussed above, and the
manufacturer's certification that the vehicle meets the refueling emission standard (even without a control system).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA retains the opportunity to test vehicles to ensure that they comply with the emission standard during certification
confirmatory testing, Selective Enforcement Audits, and in-use testing. EPA also retains the right to retract the
engineering evaluation option for diesel vehicles if the RVP of in-use diesel fuel increases or is expected to increase
beyond 1 psi (7 kPa) or a significant increase in fuel tank temperatures is expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since exhaust and evaporative emission requirements now exist for all new methanol-fueled (neat and blend) vehicles,
these shall be required to comply with the ORVR standards under the same phase-in schedule as gasoline-fueled vehicles.
EPA expects that these vehicles will use a technology similar to that used to comply with the evaporative emission
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refueling control requirement will be applied to other dedicated, dual-fuel, bi-fuel, and flexible-fuel vehicles
using other fuels (e.g., dedicated and hybrid electric vehicles, ethanol and ethanol blends, compressed and liquid
natural gas, liquified petroleum gas) as regulations covering these fuels are implemented in the future. Lead time,
safety, and other factors will be considered in the course of these actions. Full testing and engineering evaluation
certification options will be considered.

1. Leadtime, Effective Model Year and Phase-in Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Section 202(a)(6) of the Act specifies a four model year lead time before ORVR requirements are to become effective
for LDVs (``vehicles manufactured beginning in the fourth model year after the model year in which the standards are
promulgated''). After this four-year lead time, a three-year phase-in period begins, during which 40 percent, 80
percent, and 100 percent, respectively, of each manufacturer's sales of new LDVs will need to meet the ORVR requirements.
Today's action is occurring early in the 1994 model year. Thus, ORVR requirements for LDVs will become effective with
the 1998 model year. At least 40 percent of each manufacturer's LDV sales will need to meet ORVR requirements in model
year 1998, 80 percent for model year 1999, and 100 percent for model years 2000 and later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the application of ORVR requirements to LDTs is under the general authority in section 202(a)(1), the specific
lead time and phase-in requirements of section 202(a)(6) do not automatically apply. Rather, the standard ``shall
take effect after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the
requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance `` (Section 202(a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, EPA believes that the nature of ORVR technology for LDTs will be very similar
to that for LDVs and that the cost of controls, incremental to the cost of enhanced evaporative emission controls,
is minimal. EPA also does not believe that ORVR controls for LDTs present different safety issues than canisters on
LDVs where there is now general consensus that there are no unreasonable risks. We therefore believe that the lead
time required for developing these systems could be similar regardless of vehicle class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While several commenters requested a delay in the LDT ORVR requirement, commenters did not indicate that it was not
technically feasible to develop ORVR controls for LDTs during this timeframe. However, comments from the vehicle
manufacturers did express a concern that resource and facility constraints would make simultaneous development
of ORVR systems for LDVs and all trucks problematic. They have also indicated that design, development and some in-use
experience with ORVR systems on passenger cars would be helpful in the design of LDT systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that the resource and facility concerns expressed by the manufacturers and the desirability for
in-use experience with ORVR systems can be balanced against the need for emission reductions by beginning the phase-in
of ORVR requirements for LDTs after the program for LDVs has been fully implemented. In the mid-to-late 1990's gasoline-powered
vehicle manufacturers will need to respond to new evaporative emission requirements, cold CO exhaust emission standards,
and California and Clean Fuel Fleet exhaust emission standards among others. Most of these requirements apply to
all three vehicle classes and entail several hundred vehicle/engine families. Under the statutory requirement
the manufacturers will need to comply with LDV ORVR requirements in the same timeframe. And while complying with the
enhanced evaporative and ORVR requirements simultaneously using an integrated control system reduces the burden
relative to separate approaches for LDTs, a delay for LDTs is not unreasonable given the already existing requirements.
This trade-off is also acceptable in the short-term since Stage II refueling controls are or will be in place in many
ozone NAAs. However, for the reasons discussed above, EPA believes that ORVR controls are the preferred long term
approach for control of refueling emissions from LDTs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Therefore, the requirements promulgated today for LDTs will be implemented in two stages. The first stage will cover
LDTs with a GVWR of 6,000 or less (LLDT), the second will cover LDTs with a GVWR of 6,001 to 8,500 lbs GVWR (HLDT). LLDTs
represent about 70 percent of LDT sales. HLDTs represent the remaining 30 percent. For LLDTs, the ORVR requirement
will begin implementation in the 2001 model year and will phase in over three model years according to the same percentages
as LDVs. For HLDTs, the ORVR requirement will begin implementation in the 2004 model year and will phase in over three
model years according to the same percentages as LDVs (40/80/100). This schedule will permit the development and
application of cost-effective, economically achievable technology, as required by section 202(a)(2) and will
still allow consideration of the Stage II phaseout provisions of section 202(a)(6) of the CAA in the long term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions of 40 CFR 86.085&hyph;1(b) permit manufacturers to certify HDVs with a GVWR of 8,501&hyph;10,000 lbs
GVWR as LDTs. This option will remain in effect for refueling controls. HDVs certified under this option would be treated
as HLDTs for purposes leadtime, phase-in and sales compliance determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not view the provisions of section 202(a)(3) as applying to refueling controls, as that provision was probably
intended to apply only to exhaust emission standards, as did its predecessor provision. However, even if it did apply,
this section would provide for at least four years of leadtime. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is allowing this much leadtime for HLDTs anyway, designating section 202(a)(2) or 202(a)(3) as authority for
HDV leadtime has no practical significance here.

2. Small Volume Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Today's rule includes a short-term provision for small volume light-duty vehicle manufacturers. Several small
volume manufacturers commented that, as a practical matter, they cannot phase in their compliance due to their small
size and limited product lines. Small volume manufacturers also claimed that they sometimes rely on control technology
developed by larger manufacturers to develop their compliance strategies, and this would not be possible if they
must comply at essentially the 100 percent of sales level before the larger manufacturers. R&amp;D cost concerns
were cited as obstacles as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that these comments state valid concerns. As is described in three recent Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, EPA has allowed small volume manufacturers to delay compliance to the last model year of the phase-in: in
the Tier 1 exhaust emission standard rule (June 5, 1991, 56 FR 25724), the cold CO exhaust emissions rule (July 17, 1992,
57 FR 31888), and the enhanced evaporative emission standards rule (March 24, 1993, 58 FR 16003), and has decided to
allow the same accommodation for the ORVR requirement for light-duty vehicles. This provision is included, not only
for the reasons raised by the manufacturers, but also because it would be inconsistent to face ORVR compliance before
evaporative emission compliance when the comments indicate that most manufacturers plan to use integrated refueling/evaporative
control systems and these are desirable for both cost and safety reasons. In addition, requiring phased compliance
for these manufacturers effectively denies them the opportunity Congress intended to phase in the control technology.

in 40 CFR part 86, may delay compliance to model year 2000 (i.e., the third model year of the phase-in), but must comply
with 100 percent of sales in that and subsequent model years. Because of the additional leadtime EPA is affording to
LDTs, the Agency is not implementing this small-volume manufacturer provision for these vehicles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was discussed in the May 1993 notice, vehicles meeting the refueling emission standard because they are inherently
low in refueling vapor emissions (those certified without a control system using the engineering evaluation option),
and thus are waived from testing, cannot be counted in either the vehicles complying or base sales figures in determining
compliance with the sales requirements of the statute. Compliance for these vehicles is to be calculated separately.

C. Refueling Emission Test Procedures and Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes test procedures for the measurement of refueling emissions and a corresponding emissions
standard by which to judge the adequacy of ORVR control system designs. The test procedures accommodate integrated
system designs, which control both refueling and evaporative emissions with a common vapor storage unit, as well
as non-integrated system designs, which do not share vapor storage units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test procedures for these two types of control systems, although different in some ways (explained below), involve
the same basic steps: Load the storage canister with hydrocarbon vapor, drive the vehicle to provide opportunity
for canister purge, and refuel the vehicle while measuring emissions (see Figures 1 and 2). The first two steps together
are referred to as the preconditioning phase and are discussed in detail further on in this section.

1. Refueling Emissions Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedure for the refueling step is common to both integrated and non-integrated systems. It involves disconnecting
the vapor line from the fuel tank to the canister, draining the fuel tank, refueling with test fuel to 10 percent of the
nominal tank capacity, soaking the vehicle for 6 to 24 hours at 80

minute (15.1 to 37.9 liters per minute) and is terminated at the first automatic shutoff that occurs after a quantity
of fuel has been pumped equal to at least 85 percent of the nominal tank capacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the key issues raised in the July 1993 hearing and the subsequent comment period concerned the test temperature
specifications for the dispensed fuel and the residual in-tank fuel, both of which have a major impact on the refueling
vapor generation and therefore on ORVR system designs. Hearing participants discussed the merits of setting the
test dispensed fuel temperature at 67 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (19.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

&cir;F (26.7 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received on both sides of this issue. The manufacturers supported the test temperature specifications
discussed at the July 1993 hearing. They believed these specifications would enable the canisters planned for meeting
the enhanced evaporative emission requirements to also capture refueling emissions and would facilitate the use
of liquid seals as an option to mechanical seals in the fillneck. Manufacturers commented that this would provide
much needed design flexibility and alleviate their safety concerns. The American Petroleum Institute (API) and
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) supported the 81
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;84 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F dispensed temperature range proposed earlier. They expressed concern that 67 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is not representative of actual dispensed fuel temperatures on high ozone days and therefore might lead to
a situation where the test procedure does not adequately represent in-use conditions with the result that refueling
emissions are controlled inadequately in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's goal in establishing test parameters is to ensure that the combination of test conditions results in designs
that will achieve a very high level of control in use. Therefore, the representativeness of any one test parameter,
such as dispensed fuel temperature, is of less concern than the net effect of the total test. For example, in-use RVPs
in many parts of the nation during the summer months are lower than that specified in the test. What is important is the
combined effects of the key parameters during an in-use refueling event. EPA's analysis of in-use effectiveness
described in the Regulatory Impact Analysis and Summary and Analysis of Comments indicates that these test conditions
will yield designs that achieve in-use control in excess of 95 percent during the ozone season in the NAAs (even assuming
the accuracy of data showing that one region of the country has dispensed fuel temperatures within or exceeding the
81
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;84 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F range, a potentially questionable assumption, as explained in the next paragraph). Based on this analysis
and the manufacturers' comments, EPA has concluded that the test specifications being finalized in this action are
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dispensed gasoline temperature parameter discussed in the NPRM was derived using limited survey information
on in-use refueling events. The 81
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;84 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F dispensed temperature value in the NPRM was driven by refueling events in the Southeastern U.S. These dispensed
fuel temperature values are seven or more degrees higher than any other region of the country. There is no obvious technical
reason why the Southeastern U.S. values were so much higher than those found in other regions of the country. Thus,
there is some possibility that they may be unrepresentative, in which case the &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; 67

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F temperature used in the refueling test is even more representative. (EPA is not completely disavowing the
Southeastern U.S dispensed fuel data, since it is the only data available to EPA at this time. The Summary and Analysis
of Comments contains an analysis of the sensitivity of the in-use effectiveness of the ORVR requirement to this dispensed
temperature value.)

2. Integrated System Preconditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nature of integrated systems allows for a corresponding integration of ORVR and evaporative emission preconditioning
procedures. This integration is desirable because of potential test resource savings. A major revision of the evaporative
emission test procedure was completed recently and will be implemented beginning in the 1996 model year (58 FR 16002,
March 24, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed three integrated system preconditioning options for the refueling test in the May 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Option A places the refueling test after the exhaust emissions portion of the supplemental evaporative emissions
test procedure. Option B places the refueling test after the running loss portion of the evaporative emissions test
sequence. As a logical extension to this option, EPA also proposed Option B1, which adds more driving to Option A in
order to allow for more purging of the canister, similar to Option B, while avoiding the complexities of the Option
B running loss procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has selected Option B1, based on the above-described advantages and the support for this choice expressed by commenters.
This procedure follows the supplemental evaporative emission test preconditioning procedure, involving an initial
fuel tank drain and fill with certification test fuel to 40 percent full, a 12 to 36 hour soak at 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 86 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (20
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 30 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), a preconditioning drive over one Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle, another fuel tank drain
and fill to 40 percent, a canister preconditioning step detailed below, and then the exhaust emissions test. At this
point the refueling test departs from the evaporative test sequence. Instead, additional driving is conducted to
provide more opportunity for canister purge. This driving consists of a UDDS cycle followed by two New York City Cycles
(NYCC) and then by another UDDS. This driving schedule corresponds to the driving specified for the evaporative running
loss test, though not at the same high temperatures. After the driving, the above-described refueling procedure
is conducted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The canister is preconditioned by loading it with a 50/50 mixture of butane and nitrogen, at a rate of 40 grams of butane
per hour, until 2 grams of hydrocarbons are emitted from the canister (referred to as the 2-gram breakthrough point).
Alternatively, the canister can be loaded to this point with gasoline vapors by conducting repeated diurnal heat
builds. All detailed aspects of the supplemental evaporative emission test procedure, up through the exhaust emission
test, apply to integrated ORVR system testing as well (58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). The three test sequences (full
3-diurnal evaporative, supplemental evaporative, and refueling) may be performed in any order and exhaust emissions
measurements from any of the three may be considered valid. If either evaporative emission sequence has been conducted
before the refueling test, the fuel tank drain and fill and vehicle soak that precede the one UDDS preconditioning
drive in the refueling test sequence may be skipped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Non-Integrated System Preconditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-integrated ORVR systems store only refueling vapors and therefore warrant a preconditioning drivedown of 85
percent of the fuel tank capacity before being subjected to the 85 percent refueling event. This driving consists
of repeated UDDS cycles, either on a track or on a dynamometer, until a volume of fuel equal to 85 percent of the fuel tank
nominal capacity has been consumed. During the actual refueling test, the vehicle will be filled to at least 95 percent
of tank capacity, as is the case for the integrated system. If manufacturers exercise the option to do less driving
in certification testing, EPA may perform subsequent confirmatory and in-use testing using the same reduced driving
schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its discretion, EPA may test non-integrated systems with a partial refueling test procedure. This procedure helps
to ensure control in those in-use refueling events in which less than a tankful of fuel is pumped. Because the non-integrated
system test allows a nearly complete drivedown of the fuel tank capacity, thus enabling purge design strategies that
inappropriately minimize purge during the exhaust emissions test, EPA considers the partial refueling test necessary.
It also allows EPA to assess the basic question of whether the system has the capacity to handle a partial fill, a common
refueling event in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this partial fill test, following the loading of the canister with butane and fueling of the vehicle to 95 percent
of the fuel tank capacity, the vehicle will be driven some integer number of UDDS cycles such that some amount of fuel
between 10 and 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity is consumed. After a one to six hour soak, the vehicle will be subjected
to the refueling emissions measurement test with no intervening drain and fill. The fuel pumped in the test will be
a metered amount, corresponding to the amount consumed in the drive. This amount will be based on the vehicle's fuel
economy, as determined at certification.

4. Seal Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also at its discretion, EPA may perform a seal test of integrated and non-integrated designs, aimed at verifying the
integrity of fillpipe seals and vapor lines. This test eliminates consideration of potential canister emissions
by thoroughly bench purging the canister prior to the refueling event. The canister preconditioning and preparatory
driving are therefore likewise eliminated, although EPA may perform the test procedure up through the exhaust emission
test (in order to obtain this measurement) and then conduct the bench purge and refueling test. Failure of the seal
test would be considered equivalent to failing the full refueling emissions test and the same standard would apply
to both.

5. Cap Removal Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 1993 Notice, EPA requested comment on including a test to measure and control the ``puff loss'' emissions
from a pressurized fuel tank when the fuel cap is removed for refueling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to refueling emissions, vehicles can have emissions when the fuel cap is removed from a pressurized fuel
tank before the refueling event. Although these emissions potentially warrant control, EPA does not view them as
``refueling'' emissions for purposes of section 202(a)(6), since they precede a refueling and are more akin to evaporative
emissions. EPA in fact proposed, but did not finalize, such a cap-off test in the evaporative emissions NPRM (55 FR
1914, January 19, 1990) rather than in the ORVR NPRM. Thus Congress would not have been considering such emissions
when it enacted the 95 percent minimum control standard in section 202(a)(6) in the 1990 CAAAs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers commented that the puff loss test would provide no additional control over that achieved by the refueling
test and the evaporative emissions rule requirement that tanks pressurized to over 10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (25 cm) H

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O be vented to the canister upon cap removal. EPA disagrees with this assessment. The refueling test does not measure
emissions from cap removal directly after vehicle operation. The evaporative emissions requirement allows for
the venting of tank pressures under 10

&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O to the atmosphere. These emissions can be appreciable. General Motors (GM) calculated that the puff loss from venting
a 10 percent full, 20 gallon (76 liter) tank at 10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O would be about 3 grams. EPA agrees with this estimate but disagrees with the contention that this is minor, given that
this same vehicle would only be allowed to emit a little over 3 grams during the refueling test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM also argued that the execution of a cap-off test involving a warm-up drive followed immediately by a cap-off step
in a SHED would be complex and formidable. EPA agrees with GM's contentions that hot soak emissions could confuse the
puff loss measurement and that the time required to move a vehicle from a dynamometer cell to a SHED and remove the cap
would be overly long compared to the actual in-use event, which typically involves less than a minute from key-off
to cap-off. These two concerns would affect the measured emissions in opposite directions and would make it difficult
to ascertain a puff loss emission corresponding to the in-use event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA remains concerned about puff loss emissions, particularly considering that the new evaporative emission control
requirements may prompt manufacturers to rely more heavily on pressurized tank designs in the future. However, EPA
believes it necessary to defer action on this issue so that an effective test procedure can be developed, involving
more complete public participation. Therefore, EPA is leaving this portion of the rulemaking open for now and intends
to take up this issue as part of the planned further action on pressurized designs announced in the evaporative emissions
control final rule (58 FR 16012). However, it should be noted that the enhanced evaporative emissions rule will require
controls for systems whose pressure exceeds 10 inches H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O, and thus control is already in place for these extreme situations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Spitback Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes, and manufacturers' comments indicate, that vehicles would not be expected to comply with the refueling
emission standard if they emitted significant spitback emissions during the refueling test. Fuel spilled on the
side of the vehicle or in the SHED when the fuel nozzle shuts off will evaporate and be included as part of the refueling
emissions. In recognition of this effect, this final rule also waives the spitback testing requirement for vehicles
being certified to meet the ORVR requirements. Similar to the provision for ``inherently low refueling emission
vehicles'' discussed above, manufacturers can, at their option, certify as part of the certification application,
that they agree with EPA's assessment regarding the effect of spitback emissions on the ability to pass the refueling
emission standard and that their vehicle passes the spitback test standard. Of course, manufacturers may elect to
comply with the spitback test in lieu of using this waiver option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the spitback standard is still required, and EPA is retaining the spitback test and standard promulgated
in the enhanced evaporative emissions control rule (58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). EPA may conduct or require manufacturers
to conduct the spitback test to demonstrate compliance should concerns over vehicle spitback arise.

7. Nozzle Geometry Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA asked for comment on the need for fuel nozzle geometry standards as part of an ORVR program, and suggested
that auto makers and nozzle manufacturers undertake a voluntary initiative to develop national consensus standards
in this area. This initiative is being undertaken under the auspices of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).
An SAE technical committee, comprised of auto maker, fuel nozzle manufacturer, and other representatives, is considering
revisions to SAE standard J285 ``Gasoline Dispenser Nozzle Spouts''.

It is important that nozzles used in the design and testing of ORVR-equipped vehicles be similar to those found in use.
Should this committee reach consensus on fuel nozzle geometry specifications, EPA will use a nozzle meeting this
standard in all refueling emissions compliance testing, if the nozzle manufacturers agree to adopt these specifications
for future retail and commercial fuel nozzles and the auto manufacturers design their ORVR systems to accommodate
a nozzle with this geometry. If no standard is developed for nozzle geometry or if the above agreements cannot be reached,
EPA will use any commercially available nozzle in its testing.

8. Level of the Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule adopts a refueling test standard of 0.20 grams of hydrocarbon emissions per gallon (g/gal) of fuel
pumped (0.053 g/liter). This standard applies to all vehicle classes covered by this rule and covers the full useful
life. Setting the standard at this level ensures that the standard that meets the statutory requirement to provide
a minimum emission capture efficiency of 95 percent, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 1987 NPRM included a proposed refueling emission standard of 0.10 g/gal (0.026 g/liter) of fuel pumped,
which at that time represented about a 98 percent emissions reduction from uncontrolled levels. Subsequently, the
1990 CAAA called for a refueling emission standard representing at least a 95 percent reduction over uncontrolled
levels. EPA determined that this reduction corresponds to a standard of about 0.25 g/gal (0.066 g/liter) and requested
comment in the May 1993 notice on the setting of a standard in the 0.10 to 0.25 g/gal range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers supported a standard of 0.20 g/gal, arguing that this standard would satisfy the CAA minimum requirement
while providing for full useful life compliance and design flexibility. API and other commenters felt that a standard
providing a 98 percent level of control is justified based on demonstrated and cost effective technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After analyzing the comments and the projected in-use emission impacts, EPA has selected a standard of 0.20 g/gal.
This standard was chosen because it meets or exceeds the statutory minimum requirement and, since it is representative
of most refueling situations reasonably likely to occur (Cf

, 2F.3J 438, 446&hyph;47 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). At the same time, it meets the manufacturers' need for adequate design
margin and flexibility. As is discussed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments, the nature of the canister-based
control technology is such that setting the standard at a lower level would not be expected to achieve additional emission
reductions in use. Systems will need to be designed for essentially zero emissions, with the standard providing an
allowance for vehicle and test variability. It may also enhance the use of liquid fillneck seals which are projected
to have lower costs, good in-use performance, and present no safety concerns.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 202(a)(6) of the 1990 CAA Amendments (as well as its predecessor provision) requires EPA to consult with the
Secretary of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicle-based (ORVR) systems for the control of vehicle refueling
emissions. EPA began this consultation in the Spring of 1986, prior to the NPRM, and the consultation has continued
throughout the various stages of this rulemaking. DoT was represented by NHTSA throughout this process. A record
of this consultation and the various analyses conducted by EPA and NHTSA to assess the safety issue is available in
the public docket and is discussed in the April 15, 1992 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice regarding ORVR controls (57 FR 13220). Early in the consultation process, NHTSA raised concerns about the
safety of ORVR canister systems, and throughout the various stages of the rulemaking, safety has been a central issue
in the public comments and in the deliberations on the ORVR rulemaking. Unresolved concerns regarding the safety
of ORVR canister systems (at least relative to Stage II systems) delayed promulgation of the NPRM prior to the 1990
CAAAs and, in April 1992, led EPA to decide not to require ORVR controls at that time. Given the concerns raised about
vehicle safety, it is important to address the potential safety concerns as part of the implementation of the ORVR
requirement.

2. Test Procedure/Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The safety comments regarding ORVR canister systems focused primarily on the concern that ORVR systems would increase
fuel system complexity and that this would create vehicle safety risks. Many manufacturers' comments on the NPRM
indicated that the test procedure, as proposed in 1987, would force the use of non-integrated (separate) systems
for refueling and evaporative emissions control. They characterized these systems as making the fuel vapor control
system more complex than current evaporative control systems, thus creating the potential for a safety risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier, the DC Circuit held that the consultation requirement in section 202(a)(6) does not alter EPA's
duty to issue ORVR requirements. After the decision was issued and after publication of EPA's May 27, 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (58 FR 30731), EPA held technical discussions with representatives of AAMA regarding the ORVR test procedure
(See items IV&hyph;E&hyph;101,102,105,106 in the public docket for this rulemaking). The purpose of these discussions
was to identify potential changes to the ORVR test procedure which, if enacted, would facilitate the use of an integrated
evaporative/refueling control system approach with a liquid seal in the fillneck. (As was discussed above, in March
1993, EPA published a final rule requiring enhanced evaporative controls on gasoline-powered LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs.
The enhanced evaporative requirements will lead to an increase in the size of the canister used to capture evaporative
emissions, an upgrade in the purge system capabilities, as well as other system changes and improvements.) An integrated
system approach would allow manufacturers to make use of the upgraded evaporative control hardware (common carbon
canister, purge system, vapor hoses, etc.) as part of their ORVR control strategy and thus address both system complexity
and cost issues. This approach would be used in lieu of the non-integrated control system approaches which were characterized
as being complex and potentially less safe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORVR test procedure changes which would ease the use of integrated evaporative/refueling control systems with liquid
fillneck seal approaches were identified. EPA explained this option at the July 22, 1993 public hearing and requested
additional public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Auto manufacturer comments supported this approach. For example, Chrysler Corporation's comments indicated:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Chrysler believes that the proposed AAMA revisions to the test procedure and the 0.20 g/gal. standard will allow
Chrysler to design safe, efficient ORVR systems.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Ford recommends that EPA adopt the test procedure changes and standards outlined by AAMA at the Hearing on July 22,
1993, and contained in the attached comments. These changes should allow for the design and development of a canister-based,
integrated refueling and evaporative emissions system which is less complex than a nonintegrated system and which
addresses the safety issues raised in previous rulemakings. These procedural changes along with others identified
in the comments should allow EPA, in consultation with NHTSA, to find that integrated systems do not present an unreasonable
risk to automotive safety.''

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

And, in summary, an October 13, 1993 AAMA letter to NHTSA stated that:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

Comments by other manufacturers also supported this position. Accordingly, this rule enacts the test procedure
option identified above. It is supported by AAMA, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM),
and the individual manufacturers and, according to their comments, minimizes their longstanding vehicle safety
concerns.

3. DOT Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the changed circumstances since it's prior safety analysis, DoT/NHTSA undertook an independent assessment
of vehicle safety concerns associated with ORVR systems. In November 1993, NHTSA completed a study entitled ``An
Assessment of Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery System Safety''. This document reexamined the conclusions raised
in their July 1991 study, upon which EPA relied heavily on its April 1992 decision not to require ORVR controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this recent study, NHTSA revisited the principal findings of its July 1991 report to consider the positive safety
impacts of the test procedure changes and other changed circumstances. The NHTSA report, which is available in the
public docket, reached the following general conclusion regarding ORVR safety:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Basically, there were three principal areas of concern pointed out in the July 1991 report: the increased size of
vapor canisters to hold the fuel vapors, the mechanical complexity of the ORVR system, and the ability of the ORVR system
to safely manage and purge the increased volume of vapors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, technical developments, and test procedure and regulatory changes that have occurred since
the July 1991 safety assessment, have had the net effect of reducing the safety concerns raised in the July 1991 report.
The majority of vehicle manufacturers have stated that it is now possible to design safe ORVR systems that will function
properly under all operating conditions. However, there still remains some small unquantifiable increase in safety
risk due to the addition of the ORVR systems. This risk is unquantifiable since there are no data upon which to base a
numerical estimate.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, NHTSA views the changed circumstances, including the final test procedure and the use of integrated systems,
as addressing many of their previous concerns. They also acknowledge that absent actual data they cannot determine
the level of risk, and thus conclude that risks are unquantifiable. While the NHTSA report contained a brief assessment
as to why trucks might be different than cars and stated that truck prototype systems and field tests for truck ORVR
systems would be beneficial, no special safety risks were cited for using ORVR canisters to control LDT/HDV refueling
emissions.

4. EPA Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is withdrawing its April, 1992 finding that ORVR canisters pose unreasonable safety risks. First, that determination
was based on an improper comparison with Stage II controls.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 983 F. 2d at 271. Considered on their own, ORVR canisters do not appear to pose significant safety risks. Indeed, as
the Agency noted in 1987, this appears to be particularly true for integrated evaporative/refueling control systems_which
now appear to be the preferred control system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA is swayed because NHTSA has reviewed the safety of ORVR systems in light of recent developments and subsequently
has withdrawn most of the adverse conclusions in the 1991 report. NHTSA also indicates (1993 Report pp. 17&hyph;24)
that some of its remaining concerns can be addressed by choosing proper designs for canister systems. As noted above,
EPA has taken NHTSA's views strongly into account throughout the course of this rulemaking, and accordingly is influenced
by NHTSA's more positive outlook on ORVR canister safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record further indicates that installation of ORVR canisters can have some positive impacts on safety. See EPA's
``Summary and Analysis of Comments on the Potential Safety Implications of ORVR Systems'' (IV&hyph;H&hyph;04).
Safety benefits include removal of the external fuel vapor vent line from the fillneck of these vehicles, the expected
move of the canister from the engine compartment to the rear of the vehicle, the resultant shortening of the vapor vent
line, and the capture of fuel vapor previously vented at the service station during refueling. All of these actions
directionally reduce the risk of vehicle fires in crash and non-crash situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, given that the manufacturers indicate that integrated evaporative/refueling control systems minimize
their safety concerns, NHTSA's significant reduction in concerns, EPA's longstanding view of the safety of integrated
refueling/evaporative control systems and the safety benefits of ORVR controls, EPA has decided to withdraw its
April 15, 1992 finding (57 FR 13230&hyph;13231). Specifically, EPA concludes that onboard canister controls do
not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ORVR canister systems are not inherently unsafe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern about applying the ORVR requirement to trucks and incomplete vehicles (i.e.,
those produced by secondary manufacturers). However, for the most part, EPA does not believe the technical circumstances
here to be substantially different than for LDVs. All trucks, including those produced by secondary manufacturers,
are subject to the enhanced evaporative emission requirements and will have to upgrade their control systems in response
to these new requirements. Also, the ORVR test procedure for these vehicles, as for LDVs, would facilitate the use
of integrated evaporative/ refueling control systems. Potential safety concerns of vehicles completed by secondary
manufacturers should not be substantially different for integrated enhanced evaporative/refueling control systems
than they are for enhanced evaporative control systems alone. This is especially the case for those incomplete vehicles
delivered to the secondary manufacturer with a complete fuel system as are most incomplete LDTs. Also, the potential
safety benefits of ORVR systems would accrue to trucks and secondary manufacturer vehicles as well as to LDVs. Thus,
EPA believes the safety concerns, if any, to be similar to those for LDVs. In fact, while the manufacturers opposed
extending the ORVR requirement to trucks on several grounds, none indicated that safe truck ORVR systems were not
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, EPA's decision not to finalize ORVR requirements for HDVs (both complete and incomplete HDVs) at this
time and to delay LDT implementation for three years or more should minimize any remaining safety concerns about ORVR
systems for trucks (IV&hyph;H&hyph;23).

Nonetheless, EPA is very sensitive to the uncertainties expressed by NHTSA, and plans a program to implement its authority
to ensure safe systems. Sections 202(a)(4) and 206(a)(3)(A), (B) of the CAA give EPA broad authority to address the
safety of emission control systems. Section 202(a)(4) reads:

This authority has been implemented for more than ten years. The Code of Federal Regulations &sect;86.084&hyph;5(b)
requires that any system installed on a new motor vehicle to enable such a vehicle to conform to standards shall not
in its operation, function, or malfunction result in any unsafe condition endangering the motor vehicle, its occupants,
or persons or property in close proximity to the vehicle. Furthermore, &sect;86.091&hyph;23(d) requires that manufacturers
certify that the vehicles for which emission certification is requested conform to the requirements of &sect;86.084&hyph;5(b).
The manufacturer must also agree to provide descriptions of the tests conducted, the results of such tests, and other
information upon which that determination is based. Presently this safety certification is submitted in the application
for certification which manufacturers must submit for every vehicle model they plan to produce for commerce in the
United States. EPA intends to use this authority and the approach described above to implement the ORVR requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate responsibility for ORVR system safety (both design and performance in use) rests with the manufacturers.
As part of the application for certification, manufacturers will be required to make the declarations prescribed
in &sect;86.091&hyph;23 (d). During review of the certification application, EPA will study the design of the vehicle's
ORVR system, its on-vehicle configuration and operation, and will consult directly with NHTSA on these applications.
Special consideration will be given to the potential concerns raised in the course of the rulemaking process such
as component locations, materials used in the components, and connections between components. For canister-based
systems, items of special interest will include canister location and shell construction, canister/vapor hose
access for I/M testing, vapor hose routing and wall thickness, integrity of connections, and proximity of potential
ignition sources. In addition, manufacturers will want to consider concerns raised in past NHTSA safety assessments.
The November 1993 NHTSA report makes it clear that proper design is critical in system safety performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was mentioned above, EPA could ask for any or all of the information supporting the manufacturer's safety assessment
and EPA will consider all information presented by the manufacturer in this assessment whether it is based on testing,
engineering analysis, or some other source. As is present practice, EPA expects that manufacturers will conduct
engineering risk assessments and component, system, and vehicle tests to assess the safety of various ORVR system
designs and on-vehicle configurations and make any modifications or devise and implement the engineering solutions
needed to address potential problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORVR-equipped vehicles would have to meet the applicable FMVSSs, including FMVSS 301 related to Fuel System Integrity.
As noted above, NHTSA is considering amending the latter to address ORVR system safety. However, section 206(a)(3)(B)
of the CAA provides EPA with broad latitude to require manufacturers to conduct tests or provide other information
as may be needed to determine if an ORVR system meets the vehicle safety requirements prescribed in section 202(a)(4).

 notice, EPA asked for comment on whether any specific tests or other information should be required up front as part

In the same notice, EPA also asked comment from auto manufacturers and other interested parties on the desirability
of developing a process, after promulgation of the final rule, through which there could be a dialogue with EPA and
NHTSA on design questions related to the in-use safety of ORVR systems. Manufacturers' comments indicated that resolution
of the safety issue as part of the rule was most important, and they expressed little interest in establishing a dialogue
at this time. EPA remains willing to work with the auto manufacturers in this area at any time in the future.

Although ultimate safety determinations must await the certification process, EPA wishes to repeat that it knows
of nothing that would preclude the certification of properly designed ORVR canister systems on LDVs and LDTs. EPA
stresses that it has never determined for purposes of certification under section 206 that any specific ORVR system
(including ORVR canisters) would present an unreasonable risk to public safety within the meaning of section 202(a)(4),
58 FR 30740&hyph;30741. Consequently, the potential existence of means other than canisters to control refueling
emissions should not preclude certification of properly-designed canister-based control systems.

As part of the technical analysis supporting the NPRM, EPA indicated that control technologies such as collapsible
fuel bladders and cloth impregnated with activated carbon absorbers were potential alternatives to carbon canisters.
As part of the technology assessment for this final rule, EPA reviewed the record of the rule to see what options had
been put forth and to assess what progress had been made in applying these technologies to vehicle fuel systems. The
collective determination from the review was that, in some cases, parties have pursued development of these technologies
for other applications, such as aircraft fuel systems and chemical protection suits, but that less overall progress
has been made in applying these technologies to automotive applications. In some cases no progress was made, and the
technical feasibility of these designs therefore remains problematic. In one case commercial development was dependent
on industry or government support. While EPA cannot arbitrarily preclude the use of any control system design approach,
EPA concludes that such alternatives are not generally likely to be available for production application in the time
frame when manufacturers must begin to install ORVR systems on their vehicles. The potential existence of these alternative
control approaches does not preclude certification of properly designed canister-based ORVR controls.

1. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action modifies the certification process by adding the requirement for demonstrating compliance with
refueling emission standards according to the prescribed phase-in schedule. This action is expected to have no direct
impact on manufacturers' fuel economy programs. The following paragraphs summarize EPA's certification and fuel
economy requirements with regard to ORVR controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations promulgated in this action provide new definitions for refueling families and refueling emission
control systems. For LDVs and LDTs, manufacturers will normally perform a refueling test on one emission-data vehicle
per refueling emission control system and submit this test data (low altitude data) to EPA for possible confirmatory
testing. Data submitted to EPA should include the exhaust emissions data from the exhaust emissions test which is
contained in the refueling test sequence. The data should demonstrate compliance with all applicable emission standards.
Manufacturers may submit high altitude test data to EPA for possible confirmatory testing, or provide a statement
in the application for certification that vehicles will comply with applicable emission standards at high altitude.
Note that this action requires manufacturers to perform exhaust and evaporative emission tests using pre-loaded
canisters. Also note that vehicles inherently low in refueling emissions can be certified using an engineering evaluation
approved by the Administrator in lieu of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the testing has been completed, manufacturers typically submit to EPA an application for certification, containing
information about the vehicles intended for production, emission test data used to support certification, statements
of compliance with emission standards and device safety, and other information required by EPA. This action will
require manufacturers to provide refueling information in their application for certification. To determine compliance
with applicable emission standards, this action requires the refueling emission test data to be adjusted by an additive
deterioration factor, developed by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement to assure that vehicles will
comply in actual use for the useful life of the vehicle/engine. Should EPA have any concerns about the safety of the
ORVR refueling system used by the manufacturer, certification may be delayed or denied, under section 202(a)(4)
and 206(a)(3) of the CAA. This should not happen, however, with properly designed systems.

2. Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA-incurred costs associated with the certification program can be recovered in the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance
Program (MVECP) fee program (see 40 CFR part 86, subpart J). Today's action is likely to increase the amount of the MVECP
fee which is collected during the certification process since the Agency's burden is expected to increase. As discussed
in the Fee Updating Procedure section of the Fees final rule, (57 FR 30049, July 7, 1992), EPA will periodically review
its fees. During that fee updating process, the Agency intends to assess the additional burden incurred due to this
action, and if, as a result of the review, EPA determines that there has been a significant change in the MVECP costs,
a proposal to revise the fee schedule will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, manufacturers will be provided with sufficient notice and comment period prior to any changes in the amount
of the fee collected.

3. Fuel Economy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not have any direct impact on fuel economy labeling, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), or gas
guzzler data submission requirements. Because the changes to the test procedure promulgated in this action may affect
fuel economy measurements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA will not require use of the new procedure for fuel economy testing. Therefore, to generate city fuel economy values,
manufacturers may use the previously established Federal Test Procedure or may optionally use the pre-loaded canister
test procedures established in this action (which are essentially the same test procedures established in the enhanced
evaporative emission final rule, ref. 58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). EPA will normally use the same procedure for confirmatory
testing as used by the manufacturer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The fuel economy measurements may be affected because vehicles will now be tested with pre-loaded evaporative/onboard
canisters. Purging these canisters during the city and highway tests could affect the air/fuel ratio of the engine
which, in turn, could affect the measured fuel economy values for the test vehicle. EPA expects the effect to be minimal,
although it is possible that measured fuel economy values could change for some vehicles.

F. Onboard Diagnostics Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action extends the existing provisions for onboard diagnostic (OBD) systems to ORVR equipment. (The final
rule for the existing program was published February 19, 1993, 58 FR 9468). ORVR systems are very similar to evaporative
systems and this action requires that the OBD performance requirements which currently apply to evaporative systems
apply on LDVs and LDTs also to ORVR systems, both integrated and non-integrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the current OBD program for evaporative-only systems, OBD monitoring of the ORVR system is not mandatory.
However, the same approach to in-use testing will be used. That is, any in-use vehicle with evaporative emissions
of 30 g/test or higher measured over the first 24 hours of the three-day diurnal from the revised evaporative test procedure
will be flagged for further evaluation. That evaluation will consist of making any necessary repairs to ensure system
integrity, and then making a 0.04 inch (1 mm) orifice anywhere within the system. To demonstrate compliance, operating
the vehicle in this condition over the full FTP must cause the malfunction indicator light (MIL) to illuminate. A failure
of the OBD system to signal a problem could contribute to a decision to initiate a recall action. While a system operating
in such a manner (i.e., without the MIL going on) may not detect a malfunction related solely to refueling events, EPA
nevertheless believes that such a system will be sufficient if it detects general problems with vapor and purge system
integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For integrated ORVR systems, manufacturers can use the same OBD systems they use to monitor evaporative systems.
For non-integrated systems, both the evaporative and refueling sides of the system will need to be monitored. It should
be possible for the same technology to be used for both monitoring tasks in most cases. For example, a strategy that
uses engine vacuum to draw a certain minimum level of vacuum or uses a small pump to generate a positive pressure in the
entire vapor system could include a non-integrated ORVR canister in the monitoring as well. For both integrated and
non-integrated systems, EPA believes this approach will result in an adequate level of certainty that key potential
malfunctions in ORVR systems will be identified and repaired. Since a 0.04 inch orifice would emit only about 3 grams
of hydrocarbon vapor in a normal refueling event, this approach will assure a high level of in-use control.

1. Liability Periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the CAAA of 1990, ORVR controls for new LDVs must have useful lives of 10 years or 100,000 miles (160,000
km) or the equivalent, with recall testing allowed up to 7 years or 75,000 miles (120,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever
occurs first (CAA section 202(d)(1); 42 U.S.C. 7521(d)(1)). LDTs with loaded vehicle weight up to 3,750 pounds (1,700
kg) have the same useful life requirement as LDVs. All other LDTs have a useful life requirement of 11 years or 120,000
miles (190,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first. Pursuant to section 207(i), expected designs for ORVR
controls are not ``specified major emission control components,'' because they cost less than $200. Therefore,
unless more expensive components are utilized, manufacturers need only warrant them for 2 years or 24,000 miles (39,000
km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first. If, at some time in the future, the Administrator should determine
that the ORVR controls are ``specified major emission control components,'' manufacturers must warrant them for
8 years or 80,000 miles (130,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first (CAA section 207(i)(2); 42 U.S.C. 7541(i)(2)).

2. Selective Enforcement Audit Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to CAA section 206(b), the Administrator is authorized to test new motor vehicles in order to determine whether
vehicles being manufactured do in fact conform to the regulations with respect to which a certificate of conformity
was issued. Therefore, LDVs and LDTs that are certified to meet the refueling emission standard are subject to this
standard in a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1987 NPRM, EPA discussed two testing issues which resulted from performing the refueling test on newly built
motor vehicles. The first issue regarded the possible influence of new vehicle background evaporative emissions
(i.e., hydrocarbon emissions from such things as the fresh paint on a new vehicle which has not fully cured) on refueling
emission measurements. Historically, EPA has not conducted SEA testing for evaporative emissions due to the relatively
large non-fuel background emissions emitted from newly built vehicles. However, EPA expected that background emissions
would not significantly affect refueling emission measurements because the actual time for background evaporative
losses to occur would be very short (refueling emission measurements have a duration of less than five minutes). Also,
refueling measurements would be taken at an ambient temperature of approximately 80
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, so fuel and non-fuel evaporative emissions would not be increased by heating of the tank, engine, or other
subsystems, as would occur during the usual evaporative emissions test. However, to address any concerns over the
effects of background emissions, EPA proposed an additional SEA testing procedure where background emissions would
be measured and then subtracted from the refueling emissions measurement. This additional procedure would be used
if manufacturers provided evidence that newly built vehicle background emissions would significantly exceed in-use
vehicle background emissions, which were intended to be included in the refueling standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because manufacturers' comments raised concerns about conducting the refueling test without measuring for background
emissions, and about the extra time needed for the measurement, this final rule will include the new vehicle background
emissions measurement proposed in the 1987 NPRM as an optional procedure. However, this decision must be made before
SEA testing is conducted. It will apply to all vehicles tested. EPA realizes that when this background procedure is
performed, in-use background emissions, which are included in the refueling standard, will also be subtracted from
the refueling measurement. At this time, EPA has no way of separating new vehicle background emissions from in-use
background emissions. For purposes of SEA testing only, both may therefore be subtracted off. Background emissions
from the refueling measurements during in-use testing will not be subtracted since the standard includes measurement
of such emissions and there is no concern regarding the higher background emissions from new vehicles. Additionally,
upon approval by EPA, a manufacturer may develop and use its own background emissions measurement procedure for use
during SEA testing. Revisions to 40 CFR part 86, subpart G, &sect;86.608 (for LDVs) and to subpart K, &sect;86.1008
(for LDTs) incorporate this additional procedure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second issue pertained to the unstabilized condition of the vapor storage canister(s) prior to SEA testing. In
the NPRM, EPA proposed that the canisters of SEA vehicles be stabilized through a bench procedure, prior to refueling
emissions testing, to help account for any large differences that may exist between an unused canister and a broken-in
(aged) canister. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most manufacturers commented that artificially aging canisters prior to emissions testing using either the procedure
in the 1987 proposal or the evaporative emissions rulemaking is inconsistent with SEA testing and that performing
the aging process would significantly add to the time needed to complete testing. This would make it difficult to conduct
the correct number of tests per twenty-four hour period as proposed by &sect;86.608(g) for LDVs and &sect;86.1008(g)(3)
for LDTs. Additionally, several manufacturers indicated that if their vehicles were to undergo the entire refueling
test procedure (with all of the necessary preconditioning drive-downs), the vehicles may accumulate too many miles
to be sold as new. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the proposed bench-aging procedure, as well as the updated procedure, adds significant time to SEA
testing and, therefore, this final rule does not include an artificial aging procedure. EPA would have preferred
to include an aged canister in the SEA test requirement, but at this point sees no practical way to incorporate the aged
canister requirement and also address the manufacturers' concerns. Manufacturers are required to perform the complete
refueling test with new canisters for both integrated and non-integrated designs. However, if manufacturers still
have concerns about conducting the required number of tests per twenty-four hour period or accumulating too much
mileage, they may, upon EPA approval, perform the seal test described in Section C above, for either integrated or
non-integrated designs, during an SEA. The seal test is aimed at verifying the integrity of fillpipe seals and vapor
lines and eliminates consideration of potential canister emissions by thoroughly bench purging the canister prior
to the refueling event. The canister preconditioning and preparatory driving are also eliminated, allowing manufacturers
to complete testing without the additional mileage accumulation associated with the full test. Finally, the same
0.20 g/gal standard would apply and failure of the seal test would be considered equivalent to failing the full refueling
emissions test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During an SEA, manufacturers will test selected SEA vehicles until a pass or fail decision has been reached for both
the exhaust emission test and the refueling test. The 0.20 g/gal refueling standard is subject to 40 percent Acceptable
Quality Level, which is the same criteria used for exhaust emissions.

3. Nonconformance Penalties (NCPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the regulations governing NCPs (40 CFR 86.1103&hyph;87), EPA specifies the criteria which must be met before an
NCP will be made available for a new emission standard applicable to any subclass of heavy-duty vehicles (i.e., vehicles
with a GVWR in excess of 6000 lbs, including the LDTs with a GVWR between 6,001 and 8,500 lbs. which are covered in this
regulation (HLDTs)). As described in those regulations, an NCP may be established for a new emission standard if substantial
work will be required to meet the new standard and a technological laggard is likely to exist. Substantial work means
the application of technology not previously used in a vehicle class or subclass or the significant modification
of existing technology or design parameters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While ORVR systems have not been used to control refueling emissions on HLDTs and HDVs, EPA does not believe that an
ORVR requirement constitutes substantial work as defined in the NCP regulations nor does EPA believe that a technological
laggard will exist in the vehicle groups. The ORVR system is expected to be a minor extension of existing evaporative
emission control technology rather than the application of new technology or the significant modification of existing
technology or design. EPA expects manufacturers would use activated carbon for storage of refueling vapors and air
stripping for regeneration, just as are now used in evaporative emission control systems on LDTs and heavy-duty gasoline
vehicles. The purge systems will essentially be the same as those used for evaporative controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there may be some subjective disagreement on whether ``substantial work'' will be involved in meeting the standard,
EPA believes all the manufacturers of HLDTs will be able to comply with the standard and that no technological laggard
will exist. EPA recognizes that effort will be required to equip the HLDTs with ORVR systems, but the control technology
required is well defined and available to all affected manufacturers. Furthermore, this regulation provides a generous
leadtime and control is phased in over a three-model-year period. Both of these factors will provide relief to any
manufacturer who is having difficulty. In addition, the adopted test procedures address the manufacturers' technical
concerns and should negate the need for an NCP for any manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also permit consideration of NCPs for other emission standards, for which NCPs are not already provided,
if the standards become more difficult to meet as a result of a new standard. However, as the test procedure is structured,
EPA does not believe that manufacturers will encounter significant additional difficulty in maintaining compliance
with exhaust or evaporative emission standards as a result of the ORVR requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, ``substantial work'' will not be required and no technological laggards are expected. Therefore, EPA will
not make NCPs available for refueling exhaust or evaporative emission standards.

4. In-Use Performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As in the case of other evaporative emissions, the control of refueling emissions is highly dependent on vehicle operating
and environmental factors such as vehicle speed and ambient temperature. EPA recognizes, therefore, that simply
passing a test procedure cannot always ensure vehicle designs that achieve good control in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that manufacturers will design vehicles that pass the test and perform well in use. However, in order to
best achieve the statutory goal of a high degree of control efficiency, the Agency will, if necessary, make full use
of existing regulations against defeat devices. Thus, EPA may deny certification upon determination that a particular
refueling emission control system design constitutes a defeat device (40 CFR 86.094&hyph;16).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA could also invoke the defeat device regulations in the course or on the basis of the results of selective enforcement
audit (SEA) and recall testing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion, while not necessarily all-inclusive, provides examples of potential defeat devices
related to compliance with refueling emission standards. EPA's main concern is that some purge strategies used to
pass emission tests may be ineffective over a wide range of in-use driving patterns. For integrated systems, this
concern will be addressed in the Agency's evaluation of evaporative system purge strategies during the certification
process, as discussed in the evaporative emissions final rule (58 FR at 16007). The Agency will extend this evaluation
to non-integrated refueling system purge strategies as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This evaluation is intended to identify vehicle designs that, though capable of passing emission tests, may not function
effectively in use. These would include non-integrated system designs that purge well during the prolonged warm-vehicle
driving allowed in the refueling test drivedown, but not in the driving patterns involving frequent cold starts often
encountered in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also will consider to be defeat devices those designs that purge at substantially higher rates during high-speed
operation than during low-speed operation, such that they primarily depend on the high-speed purge to pass emission
tests. Even if such designs do pass the test, they may produce high refueling emissions if they purge substantially
less during typical non-freeway urban driving than during the refueling test drivedown. Also, designs that shut
purge off at any time for other than safety reasons would be closely examined by EPA for possible classification as
defeat devices.

III. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORVR controls have been under consideration by EPA since the CAAAs of 1977. The public process, which first began in
1978, has proceeded through various stages over the past 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the provisions of section 202(a)(6) of the 1977 CAAAs, EPA initiated a public process in 1978 to receive
comments on the feasibility and desirability of implementing ORVR controls. In 1980, EPA published a technical report
which tentatively concluded that ORVR controls were feasible for LDVs. However, no action was taken at the time due
to concerns over economic difficulties in the auto industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reinstituted its assessment of ORVR controls in 1983 as part of a broad assessment of the strategies available
to control emissions in the gasoline marketing industry. As part of this study, in August 1984, EPA published an extensive
analysis of the options available to control refueling emissions including ORVR controls. Supporting documentation
for this analysis are in public docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07, along with the public comments received on the ``Gasoline
Marketing Study''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving comments on the study, EPA prepared an in-depth analysis of the comments, developed further work
on several key issues related to ORVR controls, and conducted enhanced assessments of the options under consideration.
This resulted in a draft Regulatory Impact Analysis, Response to Public Comments, and related analysis and documentation
related to ORVR controls. This information is also in public docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07. A public meeting regarding
the ORVR test procedure was also held during this time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of EPA's study of emission control options for the gasoline marketing industry culminated in an August
1987 proposal to require ORVR controls on gasoline-powered LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs. A public hearing was held in October
1987 and the comment period closed in February 1988. Information supporting the NPRM and comments on the proposal
are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11. However, due initially to safety concerns raised by some commenters and
later to pending revisions to the CAA, EPA deferred action on finalizing the ORVR rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 CAAAs contained provisions requiring an integrated program of LDV ORVR and Stage II controls. In response
to the ORVR provisions, on September 3, 1991 (56 FR 43682), EPA published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice seeking further comment on the NPRM and the safety issues related to ORVR controls including a safety assessment
prepared by the DoT. A public hearing was held to receive comment on these issues on September 26, 27, 1991. The comment
period closed in late October 1991. These comments and related materials are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11.
On April 15, 1992, EPA published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (57 FR 13220) announcing its decision not to proceed with implementing ORVR controls at that time, based on
safety concerns raised by DoT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, a panel of the DC Circuit overturned EPA's 1992 action. EPA then published another 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (May 27, 1993, 58 FR 30731) raising issues for public comment and allowing approximately 90 days for comment.
Another public hearing seeking comment on the NPRM and other changed circumstances was also held. This hearing was
held on July 22, 1993 and comments closed 30 days later. These comments are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11 as are
EPA materials in support of the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the years in which ORVR has been under consideration, there have been at least five formal opportunities for
oral and/or written public comment. In addition, numerous other public interactions have occurred on this matter
and have been documented and placed in the docket for public review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the fifteen years of the ORVR public process, EPA has received hundreds of written comments regarding this requirement.
However, many of the past comments have essentially been addressed by changed circumstances or other developments.
Major issues such as fuel volatility and improved vehicle evaporative emission controls have now been decided by
regulation, and the control of refueling emissions using Stage II equipment was addressed by the 1990 CAAAs. Also,
many previous comments in areas such as ORVR costs and test procedures were factored into subsequent analyses and
notices, making only the most recent set of comments applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public docket contains a Summary and Analysis of Comments document which addresses still-relevant issues raised
by the commenters. It generally does not address past comments on issues which have been resolved by related statutory
or regulatory action or through subsequent published analyses or

IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the assessment and decision making process regarding ORVR controls, EPA has prepared an in-depth Regulatory
Impact Analysis (RIA). This RIA is available in the public docket. The RIA assesses the environmental impact, costs,
and cost effectiveness of ORVR controls, as well as other associated benefits, for the combined LDV and LDT program
described above for a number of scenarios. It also includes a sensitivity analysis for several key parameters. It
should be noted that the RIA was completed prior to EPA's decision to delay the requirements for LDTs and to exclude
HDVs. These controls were included in the analysis and were assumed to begin in 1998. EPA expects that inclusion of
these items in the analysis has no significant effect on the results and does not affect the conclusions which are based
on the analysis. The major findings of the RIA for LDV and LDT ORVR controls are presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before discussing these key findings, it is important to note that EPA analysis has assumed that ORVR controls will
apply nationwide to all vehicle classes. However, the scenarios analyzed focus not only on the overall nationwide
control program, but also on the control in the ozone NAAs. Furthermore, since Stage II controls are in place or expected
in most of the ozone NAAs, the incremental impacts of ORVR controls relative to Stage II are assessed as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While refueling emissions control has value whenever it occurs, it is most critical during the ozone season. The five
month ozone season refueling emission inventory is about 200,000 tons per year; when annualized, this value increases
to approximately 475,000 tons per year. Refueling emissions vary directly with fuel use and fuel RVP/temperatures.
Approximately 52 percent of refueling emissions occur in AAs and 48 percent occur in NAAs. Of this 48 percent, about
33 percent currently are, or are expected to be, subject to Stage II control equipment. The percentage of gasoline
consumption in the NAAs and covered by Stage II is slightly higher (55 and 44 percent respectively) than the contribution
to the refueling emission inventory, primarily due to RVP controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission reductions achieved by ORVR controls depend on the in-use efficiency of the control system and the area
in which the control is applied. Based on the stringency of the test procedure the full life useful life certification
requirement, and the salutary effect of Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs and onboard diagnostics, EPA expects
very high in-use efficiency from ORVR systems. In the ozone NAAs, where RVP control and basic and enhanced I/M are prevalent,
EPA expects in-use efficiency of over 95 percent, with a somewhat lower value in attainment areas due to lack of RVP
control and I/M. In the ozone NAAs, EPA expects in-use efficiency of approximately 97 percent. The in-use efficiency
in attainment areas (which would lack RVP control and enhanced I/M) is somewhat less, and in some cases is predicted
to be less than 95 percent. The Agency notes, however, that this prediction is skewed because data for the southeast
U.S. indicate that average dispensed fuel temperature in that region is seven fahrenheit degrees higher than anywhere
else in the country. EPA is basing its predictions on this information because it is the only available data. However,
the Agency knows of no reason why dispensed fuel temperatures should be so much higher in this region. If the same range
of dispensed fuel temperatures were used for the southeast region as for the southwest U.S., the in-use efficiency
of properly operating systems in all areas would be predicted to average 95 percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefits vary over time and with the scenario analyzed. Benefits vary over time because of the phase-in of the ORVR
requirement and the need for fleet turnover to occur before full implementation of ORVR-equipped vehicles occurs.
The key variable with regard to scenarios is the presence and possible phase-out of Stage II controls. ORVR benefits
in NAAs include control over service stations in NAAs without Stage II, control at service stations which now receive
waivers, and control over vapors missed by Stage II equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the rulemaking as a whole, neglecting the presence of Stage II controls, LDV/LDT ORVR would achieve average annual
emission reductions of over 420,000 tons per year. With Stage II phaseout when ORVR and Stage II would cover the same
percent of fuel in use, the average annual emission reduction is about 378,000 tons. Even if Stage II controls are retained,
an incremental benefit of 285,000 tons occurs nationwide. Of these reductions, approximately 20 percent occur in
NA areas, with the overall percentage in NAAs increasing substantially if Stage II is phased out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Costs of Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORVR costs of control are comprised of control system hardware costs plus short term (five year) costs for research,
development, and testing (R,D,&amp; T) minus fuel vapor recovery credits. Costs were derived incremental to the
effects of enhanced evaporative emissions and RVP control, with the assumption that most vehicles would use integrated
evaporative/refueling control systems with liquid seals in the fillneck. The retail price equivalent (RPE) for
hardware and R,D,&amp; T costs range from $6&hyph;8 for LDVs and LDTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even these small costs are somewhat offset by ORVR fuel recovery credits. The level of the ORVR recovery credit depends
on whether Stage II equipment is used when refueling. For the nationwide case, which involves Stage II and non-Stage
II areas, the NPV of the recovery credit ranges from $2&hyph;$4 per-vehicle for LDVs and LDTs. Accounting for these
recovery credits, both short and long term net costs are under $5 for LDVs and LDTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA assessed the net costs of LDV and LDT ORVR controls for three scenarios. The first (baseline) scenario neglected
the presence of Stage II controls, the second accounted for Stage II controls with phaseout in 2010, and the third included
Stage II with no phaseout. In each case, the ORVR hardware and R,D,&amp; T costs are the same, but the recovery credit
varies. In the first case the average annual cost is about ^$6 million over the period 1998&hyph;2020. With Stage II
present and phasing out in 2010, the average annual costs is $2 million. With no phase out average annual costs increase
to $27 million over the period 1998 to 2020. The 1998 NPV costs (discounted at 7 percent to 1998) for the same three scenarios
are $102 million, $264 million, and $435 million, respectively. In the cases where costs are negative, it is because
the value of the recovery credits exceeds the hardware and R, D, &amp; T costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Cost Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the net present value of the costs and emission reduction benefits, EPA has calculated the cost effectiveness
of LDV/LDT ORVR controls for the three scenarios mentioned above. For the first case where Stage II controls are neglected,
the cost effectiveness is about $35 per ton. In the second case where Stage II control is considered, but phased out
in 2010, the cost effectiveness is about $100 per ton. In the final case where Stage II is not phased out, the cost effectiveness
is about $210 per ton. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When all costs are included in the calculations but only NAA emission reductions are credited, the cost effectiveness
values change. For the first case discussed above, cost effectiveness value is $70 per ton. In the second and third
scenarios, the cost effectiveness would increase to about $250 and $775 per ton, respectively.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the VOC emission reduction benefits cited above, LDV/LDT ORVR controls have other benefits. ORVR controls
would result in an average energy savings equivalent to 78 million gallons of gasoline per year between the period
1998 and 2020 assuming no Stage II phaseout and about 108 million gallons per year if Stage II is phased out. In addition,
there will be health benefits as a result of reductions in air toxic emissions. Best estimates are the avoidance of
about 5&hyph;6 cancer incidences per year as a result of lower refueling benzene emissions. Additional cancer avoidances
are possible depending on the assumption regarding the toxicological impact of the remainder of the constituents
of the gasoline vapor. Reductions in potential non-cancer health effects and welfare benefits such as reduced crop
and material damage due to ozone would occur as well.

E. Benefit-Cost Ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comparing the average annual cost and emission reduction benefits shown in the tables presented in the RIA, if even
a minimal dollar value of $500 per ton is ascribed to the health and environmental benefits, the dollar benefits of
LDV/LDT ORVR controls exceed the costs. The benefit to cost ratio for NA areas ranges from 1.3 for the scenario where
Stage II is retained to 32 if Stage II is phased out. If Stage II operating costs which are no longer incurred after Stage
II phaseout are considered, there is an annual average monetary savings of about $40 million since the costs of operating
the Stage II control technology are eliminated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or he principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the Order
the Administrator has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because this rule has an effect on the long-term implications of stationary and mobile source controls and
requires interagency consultations. The average annual cost is about $27 million over the period 1998 to 2020, assuming
no Stage II phaseout. If Stage II is phased out, recovery credits for ORVR systems increase to the point that average
annual costs are only about $2 million (ignoring the savings in Stage II maintenance). As such, this action was submitted
to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public
record.

IX. Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a rulemaking, it must
prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required
if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for ORVR systems in this regulation apply to motor vehicle manufacturers. Small LDV manufacturers
have been granted a delayed phase-in of the ORVR requirement and LDT manufacturers have a longer leadtime than originally
proposed. Therefore, I certify that this rule will not have a significant adverse impact on a substantial number of
small entities.

. (i) Vehicle driving on a chassis dynamometer shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel
tank capacity has been consumed. Driving in testing performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent
of the fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS cycle.
Driving in testing performed by the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles as driven
in the manufacturer's certification testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank
fuel capacity (total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual fuel tanks) shall be determined
from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the nearest 0.1 gallon
(0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank volume. If this ``fuel consumed point'' occurs partway through a
UDDS cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching from the first tank to the second tank shall occur
at the 10 percent volume of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at which this occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be turned off and the vehicle parked on the dynamometer.
The vehicle may be parked off of the dynamometer to facilitate maintenance or repairs if required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) During the driving on the dynamometer, a cooling fan(s) shall be positioned as described in &sect;86.135&hyph;94(b).

approve optional test procedures other than those in subparts B, C, and O of this part for any motor vehicle which is
not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts B, C, and O of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart B of this part are applicable to Selective Enforcement
Audit testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel meeting the specifications for mileage and service
accumulation fuels of &sect;86.113&hyph;94. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified
in this section only with the advance approval of the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the
fuel tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may drain the test
fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(b) and &sect;86.152&hyph;98(a),
provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall
be made available upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA test vehicles other than the preconditioning
specified in &sect;86.132&hyph;98 only if the additional preconditioning had been performed on certification
test vehicles of the same configuration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described
in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours following vehicle
preconditioning rather than according to the time period specified in &sect;86.133&hyph;90(a). All references

of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers
is placed in the standby position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in the sample collection bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The manufacturer need not comply with &sect;86.142&hyph;90 or &sect;86.155&hyph;98, since the records
required therein are provided under other provisions of this subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi)
of this section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test procedure, the elapsed time between the initial
and final FID readings shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98(e)(8).
In addition, the vehicle soak described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and luggage
compartment of the vehicle open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b), of both integrated
and non-integrated systems instead of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, an manufacturer
may conduct the canister purge described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning
drive described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to perform the following background emissions determination
immediately prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98, provided EPA is notified
of this decision prior to the start of testing in an SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior to the background determination. Warning: If at
any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the background determination.
If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel mixing blower shall be turned on at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level encountered by the test vehicle during the entire
background emissions determination shall be 80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The windows and luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be secured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the
initial background hydrocarbon concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the end of the background
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background determination is calculated according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98.
To obtain a per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass calculated in this paragraph
by the duration of the soak, rounded to the nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi)(G) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph
(a)(2)(ix) of this section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of emissions calculated for the refueling
test according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The final
results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall be computed by dividing the adjusted value for
total refueling mass emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test as described in &sect;86.156&hyph;98(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and
methanol-fueled vehicles as follows prior to emission testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere
by applying a pressure of 14.5

0.1 Kpa) to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the fuel system from the pressure source.
Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) in five minutes.
If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and
report this action in accordance with &sect;86.609&hyph;98(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative
or refueling emission control systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative or refueling emission control systems by component
addition, deletion, or substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if approved in advance
by the Administrator.

subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For 1981 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter
which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for new vehicle compliance testing (e.g., for
certification or Selective Enforcement Audit testing) in accordance with &sect;86.081&hyph;22(c)(1), to any
setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance
with &sect;86.081&hyph;22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter
is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to
a setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable range of the
idle speed parameter on the vehicle when it has accumulated 4,000 miles, all other parameters being adjusted identically
for the purpose of comparison. The Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect
of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well
as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks. In determining
likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on vehicle
performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to performing emission testing pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section on an SEA test vehicle, the manufacturer
may accumulate on each vehicle a number of miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles, or the number of miles the manufacturer
accumulated during certification on the emission-data vehicle corresponding to the configuration specified in
the test order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Mileage accumulation must be performed in any manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results
representative of normal production vehicles. This mileage accumulation must be consistent with the new vehicle
break-in instructions contained in the applicable vehicle owner's manual, if any.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manufacturer shall accumulate mileage at a minimum rate of 300 miles per vehicle during each 24-hour period,
unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The first 24-hour period for mileage accumulation shall begin as soon as authorized vehicle checks, inspections
and preparations are completed on each vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The minimum mileage accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the manufacturer's mileage accumulation target is less than the minimum rate specified (300 miles per day),
then the minimum daily accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's mileage accumulation target.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mileage accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number of test vehicles during consecutive 24-hour periods
to assure that the number of vehicles tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test vehicles after selection for testing nor shall the
Administrator allow deletion of any test vehicle from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and
approved by the Administrator before any test vehicle maintenance of deletion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Initial test results are calculated following the test procedures specified in &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a). Round
the initial test results to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed
to one additional significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved 1980) (as
referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28 (a)(4)(i)(B)(

).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final test results for each test vehicle are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph
(a) of this section for each test vehicle, dividing by the number of times that specific test has been conducted on the
vehicle, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional
significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For each test vehicle.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final deteriorated test results for each light-duty vehicle tested for exhaust emissions and/or refueling emissions
according to subpart B or subpart C of this part are calculated by multiplying or adding the final test results by the
appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process for the engine or evaporative/refueling
family and model year to which the selected configuration belongs and rounding to the same number of decimal places
contained in the applicable emission standard. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved
1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). For the purpose of this paragraph, if a multiplicative deterioration factor as computed during the certification
process is less than one, that deterioration factor shall be one. If an additive deterioration factor as computed
during the certification process is less than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no deterioration factors for light-duty vehicle emissions obtained during testing in accordance with
subpart O of this part or with &sect;86.146&hyph;96. Accordingly, for the CST and the fuel dispensing spitback test
the term ``final deteriorated test results'' means the final test results derived in paragraph (b) of this section
for each test vehicle, rounded to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard.
Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28

(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass/fail criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The manufacturer shall test vehicles comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for all of the pollutants
associated with all of the test procedures pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a) or a fail decision is reached for
one of these pollutants. A pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles, as defined in paragraph
(b) of this section, for each pollutant is less than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative
number of vehicles tested. A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles for one pollutant
is greater than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass
and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables
in appendix XI of this part appropriate for the annual projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report submitted
under &sect;600.207&hyph;80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix
XI of this part, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. Once a pass decision has
been made for a particular pollutant associated with a particular test procedure pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a),
the number of vehicles whose final deteriorated test results exceed the emission standard for that pollutant may
not be considered any further for purposes of the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) CST criteria only. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass or fail decision is determined according to the
pass/fail criteria described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each vehicle, the CST in its entirety
is considered one pollutant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is made on the last vehicle required to make a decision
under paragraph (c) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1)(i) For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts
N, I, and P of this part. The Administrator, may on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional
test procedures other than those in subparts N, I, and P of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is not susceptible
to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts N, I, and P of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For heavy-duty vehicles the prescribed test procedures are the Fuel Dispensing Spitback Test as described in
&sect;86.1246&hyph;96 (for HDVs with a GVW of less than 14,000 pounds (6,400 kilograms)); this test for fuel spitback
is conducted as a stand alone test, thus all references to the test sequence described in figure M96&hyph;1 of subpart
M of this part can be ignored. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer,
approve optional test procedures other than those in subpart M of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is not
susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subpart M of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedures are the Federal Test Procedure, including the refueling
test procedure or the fuel spitback test, whichever is applicable, as described in subpart B of this part, the idle
test procedure as described in subpart P of this part, the cold temperature CO test procedure as described in subpart
C of this part, and the Certification Short Test as described in subpart O of this part. For purposes of Selective Enforcement
Audit Testing, the manufacturer shall not be required to perform any of the test procedures in subpart B of this part
relating to evaporative emission testing, other than refueling emissions testing, except as specified in paragraph
(a)(3) of this section. The Administrator may select and prescribe the sequence of any CSTs. Further, the Administrator
may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in
subparts B, C, P, and O of this part for any motor vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the
procedures in subparts B, C, P, and O of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart B of this part are applicable
to Selective Enforcement Audit testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel meeting the specifications for mileage and service
accumulation fuels of &sect;86.113&hyph;94. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified
in this section only with the advance approval of the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the
fuel tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may drain the test
fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(b) and &sect;86.152&hyph;98(a),
provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA test vehicles other than the preconditioning
specified in &sect;86.132&hyph;96 only in the additional preconditioning had been performed on certification
test vehicles of the same configuration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described
in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours following vehicle
preconditioning rather than according to the time period specified in &sect;86.133&hyph;90(a). All references
to an evaporative emission enclosure and analyzing for HC during the heat build can be ignored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph
&sect;86.135&hyph;90(e): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the slave tires are the same size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described
in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the cold start exhaust emission test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96 shall follow
the heat build procedure described in &sect;86.133&hyph;90 by not more than one hour.

of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers
is placed in the standby position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in the sample collection bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The manufacturer need not comply with &sect;86.142&hyph;90 or &sect;86.155&hyph;98, since the records
required therein are provided under other provisions of this subpart K. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(3)(xi)
of this section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test procedure, the elapsed time between the initial
and final FID readings shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98(e)(8).
In addition, the vehicle soak described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and luggage
compartment of the vehicle open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b), of both integrated
and non-integrated systems instead of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, a manufacturer
may conduct the canister purge described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning
drive described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to perform the following background emissions determination
immediately prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98, provided EPA is notified
of this decision prior to the start of testing in an SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior to the background determination. Warning: If at
any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the background determination.
If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel mixing blower shall be turned on at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level encountered by the test vehicle during the entire
background emissions determination shall be 80

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The windows and luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be secured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the
initial background hydrocarbon concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the end of the background
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background determination is calculated according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98.
To obtain a per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass calculated in this paragraph
by the duration of the soak, rounded to the nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(3)(xi)(G) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph
(a)(3)(ix) of this section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of emissions calculated for the refueling
test according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The final
results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall be computed by dividing the adjusted value for
total refueling mass emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test as described in &sect;86.156&hyph;98(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and
methanol-fueled vehicles as follows prior to emission testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere

addition, deletion, or substitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify the vehicles selected for testing and shall
not perform any emission tests on vehicles selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment
repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's vehicle assembly and inspection
procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this
subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter
which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective Enforcement Audit
testing, and Production Compliance Audit testing in accordance with &sect;86.090&hyph;22(c)(1), to any setting
within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with
&sect;86.090&hyph;22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is
one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a
setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable range of the
idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 4,000 miles on the vehicle
under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of comparison.
The manufacturer may be requested to supply information to establish such an alternative minimum idle speed. The
Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's
recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will
occur on in-use heavy-duty engines or light-duty trucks. In determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider
factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine or vehicle performance characteristics
and surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to performing emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number
of hours of service equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification

Calculation and reporting of test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Initial test results are calculated following the Federal Test Procedure specified in &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a).
Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28

) to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant
figure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section
for each test vehicle or engine, dividing by the number of times that specific test has been conducted on the vehicle
or engine, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one
additional significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced
in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)(

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final deteriorated test results. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The final deteriorated test results for each light-duty truck, heavy-duty engine, or heavy-duty vehicle tested
according to subpart B, C, D, I, M, N, or P of this part are calculated by multiplying or adding the final test results
by the appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process for the engine or evaporative/refueling
family and model year to which the selected configuration belongs. For the purpose of this paragraph, if a multiplicative
deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is less than one, that deterioration factor shall
be one. If an additive deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is less than zero, that deterioration
factor will be zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no deterioration factors for light-duty truck emissions obtained during testing in accordance with subpart
O of this part or with &sect;86.146&hyph;96. Accordingly, for the CST and the fuel dispensing spitback test the term
``final deteriorated test results'' means the final test results derived in paragraph (b) of this section for each
test vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The final deteriorated test results obtained in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section are rounded to the same
number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM
E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)(

Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A failed vehicle or engine is one whose final deteriorated test results pursuant to &sect;86.1009&hyph;2001(c)
exceed at least one of the applicable emission standards associated with the test procedures pursuant to &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass/fail criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The manufacturer shall test light-duty trucks, heavy-duty engines, or heavy-duty vehicles comprising the test
sample until a pass decision is reached for all of the pollutants associated with all of the test procedures pursuant
to &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a) or a fail decision is reached for one of these pollutants. A pass decision is reached
when the cumulative number of failed vehicles or engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each pollutant
is less than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. A fail decision
is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles or engines for one pollutant is greater than or equal to the
fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass and fail decision numbers
associated with the cumulative number of vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix X of this part
appropriate to the projected sales as made by the heavy-duty engine or heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer in its Application
for Certification, or as made by the light-duty truck manufacturer in its report submitted under &sect;600.207&hyph;80(a)(2)
of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix X of this part, sampling plan ``stage''
refers to the cumulative number of vehicles or engines tested. Once a pass decision has been made for a particular pollutant
associated with a particular test procedure pursuant to &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a), the number of vehicles or
engines whose final deteriorated test results exceed the emission standard for that pollutant may not be considered
any further for purposes of the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CST criteria only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass or fail decision is determined according to the pass/fail criteria described
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each vehicle, the CST in its entirety is considered one pollutant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is made on the last vehicle or engine required to make
a decision under paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In December 1975, during the aftermath of the energy crisis created by the oil embargo of 1973&hyph;74, Congress enacted
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Congress included a provision in that Act establishing an automotive fuel
economy regulatory program. That provision added a new title, title V, ``Improving Automotive Efficiency,'' to
the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Saving Act (the Act). Title V provides for the establishment of average fuel
economy standards for cars and light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(b) of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue light truck fuel economy standards for
each model year. Standards are required to be set at least 18 months prior to the beginning of the model year. The Act
provides that the fuel economy standards are to be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In determining
maximum feasible average fuel economy level, the Secretary is required under section 502(e) of the Act to consider
four factors: technological feasibility; economic practicability; the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards
on fuel economy; and the need of the nation to conserve energy. (Responsibility for the automotive fuel economy program
was delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Administrator of NHTSA (41 FR 25015, June 22, 1976)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 8, 1991, NHTSA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 50694) a questionnaire concerning fuel economy standards for MYs 1995&hyph;1997. The comments received in
response to the questionnaire are available in Docket No. 91&hyph;50.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After analyzing the responses to the questionnaire and reviewing other available data, NHTSA published a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing average fuel economy standards for light trucks for MYs 1995&hyph;97. 57
FR 61377 (December 24, 1992). The agency proposed to select the standards from within a range of 20.5&hyph;21.0 mpg
for MY 1995, and 20.5&hyph;21.5 mpg for MYs 1996 and 1997. These ranges were based on the agency's tentative evaluation
of manufacturer capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the December 24, 1992 NPRM, the agency received comments from General Motors (GM), Ford, Chrysler,
the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA, formerly the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association),
Rover Group, the National Automobile Dealers Association, and about 50 organizations concerned about the continuing
availability to consumers of a full range of light trucks, including, among others, the Coalition for Vehicle Choice,
Consumer Alert, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). The issues raised by the commenters are addressed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 7, 1993, the agency published a final rule establishing a 20.6 mpg combined average fuel economy standard
for light trucks manufactured in MY 1995 (58 FR 18019). The limited time then available to promulgate a final rule for
MY 1995 precluded a thorough consideration of the issues related to light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996&hyph;97.
Therefore, NHTSA announced that it would reach a decision later with respect to the light truck standard for those
model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to publication of the final rule establishing the CAFE standard for MY 1995, NHTSA received another comment
from Ford, in which the manufacturer revised some of the risks and opportunities it believed it faced in MYs 1996&hyph;97.
This resulted in revised CAFE projections for those years. The Department also received a letter from the Energy Conservation
Coalition (ECC) recommending that light truck CAFE for those years be sharply increased. ECC's letter was signed
by ECC, itself, as well as the Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, American
Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Center for Auto Safety, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

II. Summary of Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its analysis, the agency is establishing a combined average fuel economy standard for MYs 1996 and 1997 at
20.7 mpg. The agency notes that the relatively short leadtime for MYs 1996&hyph;97 precludes significant technological
changes beyond that which manufacturers have already planned. Given the continuing need to conserve energy, as discussed
elsewhere in this notice, and the increasing ratio of light truck to passenger car sales, NHTSA desires to insure that
feasible light truck CAFE improvements will continue to be made. To achieve this goal, the agency has published an
ANPRM in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 addressing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1998&hyph;2006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is eliminating the requirement that captive imports and other light trucks be required to meet CAFE standards
separately. Beginning in MY 1996, there will be a combined standard that will apply to each manufacturer's light truck
fleet in its entirety.

III. Manufacturer Capabilities for MYs 1996&hyph;97 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating manufacturers' fuel economy capabilities for MYs 1996&hyph;97, the agency has analyzed manufacturers'
current projections and underlying product plans and has considered what, if any, additional actions the manufacturers
could take to improve their fuel economy. A more detailed discussion of these issues is contained in the agency's Regulatory
Evaluation, which is being placed in the docket for this notice. Some of the information included in the Regulatory
Evaluation, including the details of manufacturers' future product plans, has been determined by the agency to be
confidential business information whose release could cause competitive harm. The public version of the Regulatory
Evaluation omits the confidential information.

1. General Motors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM, General Motors (GM) projected in December 1991 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level
of 20.7 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97. In its February 1993 comment on the NPRM, GM revised its projection slightly downward,
to 20.5 mpg. By comparison, in a mid-model year report submitted in July 1992, GM projected a MY 1992 CAFE of 20.2 mpg.
In its mid-model year report submitted in July 1993, it projected a MY 1993 CAFE of 19.8 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM stated in its February 1993 comment that the light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 ``should be set no higher
than 20.5 mpg, and even that may be too high.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford projected in January 1992 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.6 mpg for MY 1996, and 21.5 mpg for
MY 1997. These projections were revised by Ford in a May 1993 letter updating its comment to the NPRM, which stated that,
after re-evaluating the risks and opportunities it faced in those model years, it could achieve a light truck CAFE
level of 21.1 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.6 mpg in MY 1997. Ford stated that the risk factors could reduce its CAFE level for MY
1996 to as low as 20.8 mpg, and for MY 1997 to 21.0 mpg. By comparison, in its final model year data submitted to the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), Ford reported a MY 1992 CAFE of 20.3 mpg. In its mid-model year report submitted to NHTSA in
July 1993, that company projected a MY 1993 CAFE of 20.7 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford recommended in its comment on the NPRM that the agency establish the MY 1996 standard at the same level as the MY
1994 standard, 20.5 mpg. It commented that the agency could raise the MY 1997 standard to a level no higher than 21.0
mpg.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Chrysler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chrysler projected in December 1991 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.0 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97.
In its January 1993 comment on the NPRM, Chrysler revised its projection slightly downward, to 20.8 mpg for MY 1996
and 20.9 mpg for MY 1997. By way of comparison, Chrysler achieved a CAFE level of 21.2 mpg for MY 1992 according to its
final model year data as reported to the EPA, and projected a CAFE level of 21.0 mpg for MY 1993 in its July 1993 mid-model
year report to NHTSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler commented that it supports a standard of 20.5 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97 because it does not anticipate any
major improvements in light truck fuel economy through new technological applications.

4. Other Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle portion of the light
truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those three companies. By way of example,
in their mid-model year reports for 1993, Toyota projected a light truck CAFE of 21.8 mpg, Isuzu 21.8 mpg, Mazda 23.6
mpg, Mitsubishi 21.2 mpg, Subaru 29.1 mpg, Suzuki 28.9 mpg, and Volkswagen 21.0 mpg.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA noted that two companies, Range Rover and PAS, projected MY 1992 light truck CAFE levels that are
well below those of the large domestic manufacturers. In their mid-model year reports for MY 1992, Range Rover projected
a CAFE level of 16.3 mpg and PAS 18.6 mpg. The agency notes that in their mid-model year reports for MY 1993, Range Rover
projected a CAFE level of 15.4 mpg and PAS 18.5 mpg. Both of these companies sell a small number of light trucks in the
U.S., on the order of about 5,000 vehicles or less. PAS modifies GM light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One other company which has a CAFE capability below that of the large domestic manufacturers is UMC, a small domestic
producer of delivery vans. That company projects selling 950 light trucks in MY 1993, with a CAFE of 18.8 mpg.

B. Possible Additional Actions To Improve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency analyzed the additional actions which manufacturers may be able to take to improve their CAFE levels above
those that they currently project for MYs 1996&hyph;97. These actions may be divided into two categories: further
technological changes and product restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Further Technological Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ability to improve CAFE by further technological changes to product plans is dependent on the availability of
fuel efficiency enhancing technologies that manufacturers are able to apply within the available time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's Regulatory Evaluation discusses the fuel efficiency enhancing technologies which are expected to
be available by MYs 1996&hyph;97. However, for MYs 1996&hyph;97, limited leadtime is a significant constraint on
the increased use of these technologies. NHTSA recognizes that the leadtime necessary to implement significant
improvements in engines, transmissions, aerodynamics and rolling resistance is typically at least three years.
Also, as the agency discussed in establishing its final rule for MYs 1993&hyph;94, once a new design is established
and tested as feasible for production, the leadtime necessary to design tools and test components is typically 30
to 36 months. Some potential major changes may take even longer. Leadtimes for new vehicles are usually at least three
years. Further, light trucks have a long model life, i.e., 8&hyph;10 years or more. If a manufacturer must make a major
model change ahead of its normal schedule, this change may have a significant, unprogrammed financial impact. NHTSA
notes that AAMA stated in its comment that the above leadtimes, which the agency cited in the NPRM, are more typical
for passenger cars and that truck leadtimes are even longer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the leadtime constraint, the agency does not believe that manufacturers can achieve significant improvements
in their projected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels by additional technological actions.

2. Product Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to technological improvements, manufacturers could improve their CAFE by restricting their product
offerings, e.g., limiting or deleting production of particular larger light truck models and larger displacement
engines. Such product restrictions, if made necessary by selection of a CAFE standard that is above manufacturers'
capabilities, could result in adverse economic impacts on the industry and the economy as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop an independent indicator of the potential impacts of a standard that could be met only by product restrictions,
the agency estimated the loss of production associated with sufficient production restrictions by GM to raise its
CAFE by 0.5 mpg. To estimate this effect, the agency eliminated production of GM's least fuel efficient models until
the desired improvement in CAFE was achieved. NHTSA stated in the NPRM that this approach tends to yield the maximum
possible negative impacts, because it does not include the possibility of consumers accepting a smaller truck or
engine, or switching to vehicles over 8500 pounds GVWR. Also, it ignores the possibility of additional technological
improvements to these truck fleets, or compliance through the use of credits earned in other model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For MY 1996, the NHTSA analysis indicates that to increase its CAFE by 0.5 mpg by restricting sales, GM could suffer
a sales loss of up to 151,000 units of its projected light truck production for that year. The potential job losses under
this scenario in manufacturer and supplier industries could total roughly 25,000. For MY 1997, a similar increase
in CAFE of 0.5 mpg could cause GM a sales loss of up to 142,000 units, with a concurrent potential loss to the industry
of nearly 24,000 jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM commented that it takes issue with NHTSA's statement that its analysis of job losses is necessarily an upper bound.
That company stated that it could be that a manufacturer's product restrictions would not be done by eliminating the
least fuel efficient vehicles first from its CAFE fleet, but a manufacturer could instead choose to restrict products
based not only on their fuel efficiency but also their profit contributions. GM stated that this strategy could lead
to larger lost sales and jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the considerations discussed above, NHTSA concludes that significant product restrictions should not be
considered as part of manufacturers' capabilities to improve their MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Manufacturer-Specific CAFE Capabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed later in this notice, NHTSA takes ``industrywide considerations'' into account in setting fuel economy
standards. In carrying this out, the agency has traditionally focused on the least capable manufacturer with a substantial
share of light truck sales. For MYs 1996&hyph;97, the agency has determined that GM is the least capable manufacturer
with a substantial share of sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, GM currently projects its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE level at 20.5 mpg. It has also identified
certain risks related to technology and mix which it says could reduce its CAFE level by as much as 0.5 mpg in MY 1996 and
0.3 mpg in MY 1997. As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, however, the agency has analyzed these potential risks
and believes that they are unlikely to have as large an effect as GM believes. In addition, GM has identified an additional
product action it is considering which could also reduce its CAFE. However, NHTSA believes the issues of whether GM
will actually take the product action, and if so, what the fleet penetration would be for MYs 1996&hyph;97, are too
speculative to justify an adjustment to GM's CAFE capability. NHTSA notes that it is not identifying the product action
because it is confidential business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully evaluating GM's product plan, NHTSA believes that company is capable of achieving a light truck CAFE
of 20.7 mpg in both MYs 1996 and 1997. The factors explaining the difference between GM's projection and the agency's
estimate of its capability are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, as discussed in the NPRM, GM projects that a much larger portion of its MYs 1996&hyph;97 fleet will have four-wheel
drive (4WD) than it has had in recent years, or than its competitors are projecting. The agency stated in the NPRM that
it is not aware of any reason to expect that the 4WD market will continue to increase. NHTSA also stated that it believes
there are alternatives to 4WD, including traction control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM commented that it believes its forecast of MYs 1996&hyph;97 4WD penetration is realistic, stating that competitors'
actions in the 4WD segments, the use of all-wheel drive configurations and market data for future years support its
projections. GM also argued that traction control is not an alternative to 4WD trucks since it has little benefit for
off-road applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency continues to believe that it is unlikely that the 4WD market share will increase appreciably for the fleet
in general, or for GM in particular, over the timeframe between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97. Since the mid-1980's, the
4WD share of total light truck sales for each model year has consistently been within the range of 32&hyph;35 percent.
No data have been presented to the agency which demonstrate that this share will significantly change by MYs 1996&hyph;97.
The agency notes that, while it agrees that traction control isn't an alternative to 4WD for off-road applications,
it would be a reasonable alternative for on-road use for many consumers. No evidence has been presented to the agency
which shows that there will be increased need or demand for more 4WD or off-road vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, since NHTSA believes that GM's MYs 1996 and 1997 product plans overstate
the percentage of 4WD vehicles that it will sell, the agency has adjusted that company's CAFE projections to reflect
what it believes is a more realistic share. In making this adjustment, the agency assumed that GM's 4WD percentage
for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will be the same as for MY 1993, the model year in which GM had its highest 4WD share ever. NHTSA also
refined the analysis presented in the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) to more accurately reflect
the particular vehicles that GM is likely to sell more of and less of. With this adjustment, and assuming that the 4WD
share of GM's light truck fleet for MYs 1996&hyph;97 is consistent with both that company's and its competitors' historical
levels, its CAFE would be more than 0.1 mpg higher in MY 1996, although it would be less than half that amount higher in
MY 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA stated in the NPRM that the GM fleet leads the other manufacturers in every engine performance calculation carried
out by the agency and that GM's performance levels are detrimental to its fuel economy performance. The agency indicated,
for example, that if GM's light truck fleet for MY 1995 were closer to the values achieved by other manufacturers for
the various performance measurements, GM's CAFE values in that model year might be improved by between 0.3 and 0.4
mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM commented that it disagrees with the agency's assessment in the NPRM that GM's CAFE could be boosted 0.4 mpg by lowering
engine performance. That company stated that it believes that NHTSA's performance adjustment was based on an incorrect
sales weighted analysis of GM's performance levels compared to its competitors. GM stated that a manufacturer's
average performance level, like many other vehicle attributes such as average weight or engine displacement, is
a function of the mix it sells. That company stated that when its mix is compared to its competitors' mix, GM's performance
levels do not appear to be out of line with other manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the agency has evaluated GM's comment concerning comparative performance
levels. NHTSA has also reviewed revised MYs 1996&hyph;97 fleet projections submitted by GM and Ford, which resulted
in reduced fleet average values for almost all performance measures. In light of these adjustments, NHTSA has concluded
that the performance level of the GM fleet is only slightly greater than its competitors and that GM can make a small
improvement in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE by bringing its performance levels more in line with its competitors.
The value of a CAFE adjustment if GM were to reach comparable levels of performance would be nearly 0.2 mpg in both MYs
1996 and 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that there are few other opportunities available to GM to make small improvements in its MYs 1996&hyph;97
light truck CAFE. There is little time left before the start of the MY 1996 production in, roughly, July 1995. It is unlikely
that GM can make any significant technological change to its products to increase its average fuel economy in this
period, and the agency is unable to discern any technology plans for MY 1997 that might be pulled ahead for earlier introduction
in MY 1996. The additional leadtime before MY 1997 production begins may allow for some minor technological improvements.
The agency estimates that these could increase GM's CAFE by up to 0.1 mpg in MY 1997.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GM faces certain technological risks during MYs 1996&hyph;97 that could lower its CAFE in those model years. Based
on its evaluation of information submitted by GM, NHTSA estimates that these risks could decrease GM's MYs 1996&hyph;97
CAFE by more than 0.1 mpg in each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By adjusting GM's MYs 1996 and 1997 product plans to reflect all of the factors stated above, NHTSA has concluded that
GM is capable of achieving a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, Ford currently projects its MY 1996 light truck CAFE level at 21.1 mpg, and its MY 1997 light truck
CAFE level at 21.6 mpg. It has also identified certain volume sales and technological risks which it says could reduce
its CAFE level by as much as 0.3 mpg in MY 1996 and 0.6 mpg in MY 1997. Ford has also identified several opportunities which
could slightly increase its CAFE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated the risks and opportunities identified by Ford, as
well as other means that may be available to Ford to improve its CAFE. The agency believes that Ford overstates the risks
that can reasonably be expected to occur in both years. NHTSA expects the risks that negatively affect Ford's CAFE
to be offset by sufficient opportunities to result in a capability of 21.2 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.6 mpg in MY 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Chrysler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, Chrysler currently projects its MY 1996 light truck CAFE level at 20.8 mpg, and its MY 1997 light
truck CAFE level at 20.9 mpg. After evaluating Chrysler's product plan, NHTSA has concluded that Chrysler can achieve
CAFE levels of at least 20.8 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.0 mpg in MY 1997. The agency believes that the additional leadtime available
before MY 1997 vehicles begin production may allow Chrysler to make technological refinements or improvements,
or to move certain planned improvements forward to MY 1997. This could increase Chrysler's MY 1997 CAFE by up to 0.1
mpg, thus allowing the company to attain a CAFE level of 21.0 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NHTSA has focused its analysis on GM, the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales, the agency
does not believe that company's capability is significantly below that of Chrysler, although it is well below that
of Ford. As indicated above, the agency believes that Ford has the capability to achieve a MY 1996 CAFE of 21.2 mpg and
a MY 1997 CAFE of 21.6 mpg, and that Chrysler can achieve a MY 1996 CAFE of 20.8 mpg and a MY 1997 CAFE of 21.0 mpg. The agency
believes that the ability of Ford and Chrysler to improve their CAFE levels above their projections is small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency must, therefore, disagree, with the comment received from ECC that argued that CAFE levels of 23 mpg in MY
1996 and 24 mpg in MY 1997 would be within the capability of manufacturers. The ECC cited a study of fuel economy by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The study, which was jointly commissioned by NHTSA and the Federal Highway Administration
in 1991, stated that a 22 mpg CAFE standard would be within manufacturers' capabilities. ECC also cited ``best-in-class''
analysis performed by the EPA, purportedly showing that light trucks could achieve a 24.3 mpg CAFE level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ECC failed to address the agency's discussion of the limitations of the NAS study in the NPRM (see 57 FR 61384), which
noted that the methodology used by the NAS in its study ``has little relevance as a reference value for this rulemaking.''
The figure used by the NAS in reaching its conclusion that a 22 mpg level was possible in MY 1996 was intended to represent
the entire light truck fleet, and not the capability of one or two manufacturers with a significant share of the market.
As NHTSA has noted, individual large manufacturers may have light truck fleets with a mix toward larger, less fuel
efficient trucks that have the effect of lowering their overall CAFE. In addition, the model mix used in the study was
derived from EPA preliminary data for MY 1990, and did not bear a close relationship to the actual mix produced in MY
1991, much less the projected mix for MY 1996. Nor did the study include large vans and utility vehicles, which are a
significant segment of the light truck market, and have lower fuel economy levels. The agency stated in the NPRM that
it could not use the NAS study as a blueprint for setting CAFE standards, and ECC did not rebut the agency's statement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The best-in-class analysis does not take into account sales or popularity in the market. Most vehicles that get best-in-class
fuel economy ratings have the poorest sales in their class as well. NHTSA cannot force consumers to buy best-in-class
light trucks, which often suffer from the disadvantage that they do not possess the power, room, or other attributes
that light truck purchasers find desirable. Nor, given the very short leadtime between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97,
would manufacturers have the chance to redesign their light trucks to more closely be capable of achieving best-in-class
fuel economy levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its own analysis and in light of the lack of evidence presented by ECC, the agency rejects that commenter's
argument that CAFE levels of 23 mpg in MY 1996 and 24 mpg in MY 1997 would be within manufacturers' capabilities.

In determining the maximum feasible fuel economy level, the agency must take into consideration the potential effects

completed, that may have an impact on fuel economy capability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated several safety rulemakings for their potential impacts
on light truck fuel economy in MYs 1996&hyph;97. These include revisions to FMVSS Nos. 208, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. FMVSS 208 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 26, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 12472) a final rule requiring automatic restraints on trucks with a gross
vehicle weight rating of 8500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5500 pounds or less. These requirements
phase in at the following rate for each manufacturer: 20 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1994
to August 31, 1995; 50 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996; 90 percent of
light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1996 to August 31, 1997; and all light trucks manufactured on or after
September 1, 1997. Thus, the requirement will affect 50 percent of MY 1996 light trucks and 90 percent of MY 1997 light
trucks. Although light truck manufacturers may comply, as passenger car manufacturers have in the past, with the
automatic restraint requirements by using automatic belts or air bags, NHTSA expects that essentially all light
truck manufacturers will comply by using air bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage the use of more innovative automatic restraint systems (primarily air bags) in light trucks, during
the first four years of the phase-in (i.e., through MY 1998) manufacturers may count each light truck equipped with
such a restraint system for the driver's position, and a dynamically tested manual safety belt for the right-front
passenger's position, as a vehicle complying with the automatic restraint requirements. Beginning with MY 1999,
however, all light trucks are required to provide automatic restraints for both the driver and right-front passenger
positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to amend its automatic restraint
requirements to mandate that 80 percent of MY 1998, and all MY 1999 light trucks be equipped with driver and passenger-side
air bags. On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 46551) to implement this requirement. Since NHTSA expects that essentially all manufacturers will rely on
air bags for compliance with the light truck automatic restraints requirements, this provision should have a negligible
substantive impact, and will not affect MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 1991 light truck automatic restrain rulemaking, which is available
in the public docket at NHTSA, the agency estimated weight increases per vehicle ranging from 15.3 pounds for a driver's-side
air bag to 35.7 pounds for both driver and right-front passenger air bags (including ``secondary weight,'' i.e.,
weight added for supporting structure, etc.). Using these figures, NHTSA estimated that fuel economy could be reduced
by about 0.05 to 0.11 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The automatic restraint weight estimates provided by the manufacturers in their responses to the Request for Comments,
and the NPRM for this rulemaking were generally consistent with those previously developed by the agency. NHTSA calculates
that the manufacturers' estimates translate into fuel economy penalties of 0.07&hyph;0.12 mpg for MY 1996 and 0.11&hyph;0.14
mpg for MY 1997. These weight effects are reflected in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections, so there is no
need for NHTSA to add an explicit adjustment to their projections to consider the impact of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. FMVSS 214
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 14, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 27427) a final rule extending the ``quasi-static'' test requirements of FMVSS
214 to trucks, multipurpose vehicles, and buses with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less. On July 13, 1992, NHTSA published
(57 FR 30917) a final rule establishing a brief phase-in for the requirements of this rule. Manufacturers must meet
the requirements for all of their light trucks as of September 1, 1994. The ``quasi-static'' requirements have the
effect of requiring each side door to be designed to mitigate occupant injuries in side impacts. It measures performance
in terms of the ability of each door to resist a piston pressing a rigid steel cylinder against it. Manufacturers generally
comply with the standard by reinforcing the side doors with metal beams or rods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Regulatory Evaluation accompanying the rule, NHTSA estimated that the requirements of FMVSS 214 would result
in an average weight increase of 24.8 to 26.7 pounds (including secondary weight). This weight increase could result
in a fuel economy degradation of 0.1 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The weight estimates provided by the manufacturers for quasi-static side impact protection translate, according
to NHTSA calculations, into fuel economy penalties of approximately 0.04&hyph;0.07 mpg for each model year, MYs
1996 and 1997. These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections, so there is no need
for NHTSA to add an explicit adjustment to their projections to consider the impact of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also considering other regulatory requirements to protect light truck occupants in side impacts. The
agency addressed a number of possible requirements in an ANPRM published on August 19, 1988 (53 FR 31716). In addition,
on June 5, 1992, pursuant to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, NHTSA published (57 FR
24009) an ANPRM concerning whether passenger car dynamic side impact protection requirements should be extended
to light trucks. Since any additional requirements in this area would take effect after MY 1997, there will be no impact
on MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. FMVSS 216
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 17, 1991, NHTSA published a final rule (56 FR 15510) amending FMVSS 216, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Roof Crush Resistance, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to extend its requirements to light trucks with GVWRs of 6,000 pounds or less. Previously, the standard applied only
to passenger cars. The effective date of the rule is September 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FMVSS 216 is intended to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger compartment in
rollover crashes. This standard established strength requirements for the forward portion of the roof to increase
the resistance of the roof to intrusion and crush. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that this requirement will have a negligible impact on light truck manufacturers' MYs 1996&hyph;97
fuel economy capabilities. Most light trucks already meet the standard. NHTSA calculates that the manufacturers'
weight impact estimates translate into fuel economy penalties of about 0.003&hyph;0.030 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97.
These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. FMVSS 108
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 19, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 16015) a final rule requiring new light trucks to be equipped with center high-mounted
stoplamps (CHMSLs). The effective date was September 1, 1993. With an estimated weight effect of about one pound,
this rule has a negligible CAFE effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. FMVSS 201
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 8, 1993, NHTSA published (58 FR 7506) a notice proposing to amend FMVSS 201 to require passenger cars and
light trucks to meet a new in-vehicle component test to provide protection when an occupant's head impacts upper interior
components (such as A-pillars and side rails) during a crash. The estimated weight effect for light trucks for this
proposed requirement averages six to nine pounds per vehicle, for a fuel economy effect of 0.03 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, it is still indeterminate as to whether the proposed requirement will affect light trucks in MYs 1996&hyph;97.
At this time, therefore, the agency cannot take potential fuel economy effects into consideration when establishing
fuel economy standards for MYs 1996&hyph;97.

6. Rollover Prevention
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to publish an ANPRM or NPRM by May 31,
1992 to provide ``protection against unreasonable risk of rollovers of passenger cars, multipurpose passenger
vehicles, and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500
pounds or less.'' On January 3, 1992, NHTSA published (57 FR 242) an ANPRM announcing that the agency is considering
whether to propose a safety standard to reduce the casualties associated with rollovers of passenger cars, pickup
trucks, vans, and utility vehicles. In addition, on September 29, 1992, NHTSA published a notice (57 FR 44721) announcing
the availability of a document describing the agency's planned rulemaking effort, data analyses, and physical research
to address the problem of rollover crashes and resulting injuries and fatalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since NHTSA has not yet proposed any requirements in this area, it will not have an impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE capabilities.

B. Revised Emissions Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose more stringent exhaust emissions standards on light trucks. Standards
are also becoming tighter in California. Under the CAAA, new standards for light trucks with GVWRs up to 6,000 pounds
have begun phasing-in. The phase-in provides for compliance by 40 percent for MY 1994, 80 percent for MY 1995, and 100
percent for MY 1996 and afterwards. For light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR, more stringent standards begin to take
effect in MY 1996. Fifty percent of these vehicles must comply with the new standards in MY 1996; all light trucks over
6,000 pounds GVWR must meet the new standards for MY 1997 and later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current standards for exhaust emissions will tighten substantially under the CAAA. Over the ``full useful life''
of a vehicle, emissions standards will be 0.80 grams/mile for total hydrocarbons, and will range (depending on vehicle
and test weight) from 0.31 to 0.56 grams/mile for non-methane hydrocarbons, from 4.2 to 7.3 grams/mile for carbon
monoxide, from 0.6 to 1.53 grams/mile for oxides of nitrogen, and from 0.10 to 0.12 grams/mile for particulate matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The CAAA also require EPA to establish standards for carbon monoxide emissions at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which came
into effect in the current model year. Further, for all gasoline-fueled motor vehicles, the CAAA require EPA to promulgate
regulations covering evaporative emissions (1) during operation (``running losses'') and (2) over two or more days
of non-use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their questionnaire responses, none of the auto companies provided substantial detail on the possible impacts
of these standards on MY 1996&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy capabilities. GM stated, ``The total impact of the
Clean Air Act Tier I and the California emissions standards on truck fuel economy is unknown at this time. *&blank;*&blank;*
Although not quantified, preliminary indications are that there will be some lost opportunities to improve fuel
economy when redesigning our powertrains to comply with these standards.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford stated that, ``[M]ost troublesome is the effect of compliance with the amended Clean Air Act. We project that
compliance has reduced the average truck fuel economy by 0.3 mpg after inclusion of technology which has an offsetting
effect *&blank;*&blank;* and it negates other technology benefits.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA indicated in the NPRM and PRIA that it believes the net impact on CAFE capabilities due to changes in emissions
requirements is likely to be minimal. Some of the new requirements will lead to fuel savings, while others may lead
to fuel economy losses. Benefits will be obtained from enhanced evaporative controls and the ``low temperature''
carbon monoxide standards because manufacturers will sharpen their fuel-control systems, using techniques such
as sequential port fuel injection. Slight fuel economy losses may result from tighter hydrocarbon and nitrous oxides
emissions standards, particularly for larger engines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In their comments on the NPRM, the manufacturers did not provide data indicating that new emissions requirements

Ford believes that NHTSA's list of other Federal standards that might have an impact on light truck fuel economy during
MYs 1995&hyph;97 is insufficient. A more comprehensive list would include Potential Revisions to the Federal Test
Procedure (FTP) such as higher speeds and accelerations and electric dynamometer true road load calibration, IM240
Short Test Requirements, Onboard Diagnostics, Cold CO Testing, Enhanced Evaporative Testing Requirements, Section
177 States, [and] Fuels or Fuel Additives such as reformulated gasoline and MMT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this point, Ford has not allocated resources to collectively assess the fuel economy implications, of required
emission control system calibration strategies and hardware, that may be associated with the above requirements.
However, it is reasonable to believe that several of these potential requirements will have a significant impact
on light truck fuel economy.

of these standards is presented in the Regulatory Evaluation. A summary of the agency's analysis follows:

1. Potential Revisions to the Federal Test Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has not to date proposed any revisions to the FTP, so no impact is expected for MYs 1996&hyph;97.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has issued new inspection and maintenance test procedures to help ensure that vehicle emission controls function
properly in real-world use, and has proposed a new Certification Short Test procedure. It has also issued a rule, effective
for MY 1996, outlining new Certification Short Test procedures to ensure that properly maintained passenger cars
and light trucks have no elements of design that would cause ``pattern failure'' in inspection and maintenance programs.
However, EPA's analyses have not indicated that there would be any impact on manufacturers' fuel economy capabilities
as a result of these rulemakings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has issued a final rule on onboard diagnostics that applies to MY 1994 and later passenger cars and light trucks,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has issued new low temperature carbon monoxide testing requirements which will apply to all MY 1996 and later model

and may actually result in a slight fuel economy benefit.

5. Enhanced Evaporative Testing Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has recently issued enhanced evaporative emissions standards. Any negative impact on fuel economy (due to increased
weights of upgraded evaporative emissions control system) would be very slight. EPA estimates that larger evaporative
canisters, vapor lines, and purge valves will add an average of 2.9 pounds to the weight of a light duty truck. Using
NHTSA's secondary weight multiplier of 1.7, this would mean a total increase of 4.9 pounds, which would reduce fuel
economy by approximately 0.017 mpg. However, this requirement only applies to 20 percent of MY 1996 vehicles and 40
percent of MY 1997 vehicles, so the total respective fuel economy penalties would not be greater than 0.003 mpg and
0.007 mpg. EPA, however, expects offsetting fuel economy benefits, which it has not yet quantified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``Section 177 States'' refers to states which voluntarily adopt the more stringent California emissions
standards. At this time, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, and other Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states
have either passed legislation to adopt the California emissions standards during the mid-1990s, or are considering
enacting such legislation. However, there are ongoing legal challenges to adoption of the California emissions
standards. NHTSA has not received any data showing any impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy capabilities
as a result of states other than California adopting the California emissions standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has not proposed any changes in the current certification test fuel, so NHTSA does not expect any fuel economy impact
for MYs 1996&hyph;97 light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has not made any adjustments to the manufacturers' CAFE projections to account for any impacts of changing emissions
standards during MYs 1996&hyph;97. The agency notes that Ford appears to be the only manufacturer that explicitly
included a potential fuel economy loss (an average of 0.3 mpg) in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE projection. Since Ford
is not the ``least capable'' manufacturer and NHTSA is not basing the selection of the MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck
CAFE standard primarily on Ford's capability, it is unnecessary to resolve whether Ford's capability should be adjusted
upward because of Ford's inclusion of this estimated fuel economy loss in its projection.

C. Test Weight for Light Trucks Over 6,000 Pounds GVWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAAA require that, beginning with MY 1996, many light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR be tested, for emissions purposes,
at the average of curb weight and GVWR. This requirement applies to one-half the ``over 6,000 pound'' fleet in MY 1996
and all of this fleet in MY 1997. Previously, test weights were determined based on ``loaded vehicle weight,'' (LVW)
which is defined as curb weight plus 300 pounds. Loaded vehicle weight has been the sole basis used to calculate ``equivalent
test weight,'' which is the weight used for dynamometer testing. EPA has defined the average of vehicle curb weight
and GVWR to be ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'' (ALVW) (see 56 FR 25739), which will be used as the basis for determining
equivalent test weight for emission testing of the ``over 6,000 pound'' test fleet described above. ALVW is higher
than the LVW, and if light trucks are tested at ALVW, there will be a loss in the estimated fuel economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAAA do not require fuel economy testing to be performed at ALVW. However, because exhaust emissions testing must
be done at ALVW for light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR, use of a different test weight system for fuel economy could
require manufacturers and EPA (when conducting confirmatory tests) to test each of these trucks twice: once at its
``equivalent test weight'' based on LVW for fuel economy purposes and once based on ALVW for exhaust emissions purposes.
Another approach would be for EPA to mandate that trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR be fuel economy tested at ALVW and for
NHTSA to consider any resulting deleterious fuel economy effect in establishing CAFE standards for the affected
model years. A third approach would be to have a manufacturer-specific test procedure adjustment to account for the
proportion of its fleet affected by this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic auto manufacturers have pointed out that testing at the higher weights would have a negative fuel economy
impact. Using MY 1992 data, GM claimed a potential impact in MY 1997 of at least 0.5 mpg. Ford estimated a possible loss
in MY 1997 of 0.2&hyph;0.3 mpg. Chrysler did not give a specific number but agreed that fuel economy would be lowered.
Import manufacturers are unlikely to have any significant penalty from this test procedure change because they produce
few, if any, light trucks with a GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated February 18, 1992, EPA stated that NHTSA should set CAFE standards with the heavier test weight in
mind and stated that dual testing would entail increased expenses. EPA also noted that EPCA requires integrated fuel
economy and emissions testing, although this requirement is limited by the language ``to the extent practicable.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the EPA letter was sent, MVMA (now AAMA) indicated to EPA that requiring the heavier test weight would also increase
testing expenses, by forcing separate fuel economy tests for light trucks above and below 6,000 pounds GVWR. In addition,
MVMA raised concerns that changing the basis for determining fuel economy on only a portion of the light truck fleet
(i.e., those above 6,000 pounds GVWR) would cause consumer confusion and affect the competitiveness of manufacturers
with a higher proportion of the sales of the heavier light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments on the appropriate means of handling this issue in the context of setting the
MY 1995&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy standards. The agency stated that if EPA mandates fuel economy testing at
ALVW, NHTSA would account for the impacts of this testing in establishing light truck fuel economy standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Included in the proposal is a request for comments on the consequences of performing fuel economy testing for heavy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The EPA plans to defer to NHTSA's policy decisions on issues such as the competitiveness effects

In commenting on the NPRM, GM, Ford, Chrysler, AAMA and Rover Group all supported the continuation of fuel economy
testing at LVW. AAMA's comment was typical, ``Retention of the LVW criteria will avoid needless test and CAFE data
base complexities, avoid added customer confusion when comparing fuel economy labels and avoid creation of unrealistic
competitive fuel economy rating differences.''

After considering the comments on the new emissions test procedure requirements, NHTSA has concluded that the simplest
and most equitable procedure for both manufacturers and the Federal government is to continue fuel economy certification
using LVW values for all classes of vehicles. NHTSA has informed EPA of its decision and, in a March 4, 1993 letter to
NHTSA, EPA agreed to abide by NHTSA's decision and stated that it would undertake ``the regulatory and guidance revisions
needed to allow dual testing.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under terms of the international Montreal Protocol, the United States and other industrialized nations have agreed
to halt production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000. In February 1992, President Bush announced that
the United States would phase out production by the end of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Ford and General Motors identified weight penalties for eliminating the use of CFCs in their vehicles' air conditioning
systems of seven pounds or less for each MY 1995&hyph;97. NHTSA estimated that these weight additions could result
in an average fuel economy penalty of 0.02 mpg. These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy
projections.

V. Domestic/Import Fleet Distinction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to eliminate the requirement that captive imports and other light trucks be required to
meet light truck CAFE standards separately. This requirement has been in effect since MY 1980 (see 42 FR 63184, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, December 15, 1977). At the time the agency introduced these separate categories, it believed that the division would
prevent light truck CAFE standards from acting as an incentive for the domestic manufacturers to increase the numbers
of captive import vehicles in their fleets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the past decade, however, the captive import sector of the fleet has become insignificant. Whereas in 1980, captive
imports accounted for 14.7 percent of the overall light truck market, in 1992 they made up less than 0.5 percent of that
market. GM and Ford no longer have any captive import light trucks. Chrysler's captive import fleet consisted, for
MY 1993, of only about 6,000 vehicles (compact pickups produced in Japan by Mitsubishi). Given the changes in market
conditions, NHTSA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that there is no need or reason to continue to maintain the separate
categories. While the Act specifies a similar two-fleet rule for passenger automobiles, it does not require the agency
to provide similar treatment to light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their comments to the NPRM, the domestic manufacturers and the AAMA supported elimination of the captive import
category. The agency did not receive any other comments that addressed the issue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above and in the NPRM, and in light of the comments, beginning in MY 1996, the agency will no
longer require light trucks to meet the CAFE standard separately, based on whether they are captive imports. A new
Table IV is being added to the regulatory text, which indicates a single CAFE standard for all light trucks without
category distinctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since CAFE credits cannot ordinarily be applied across classes of light trucks, the agency proposed a method of accommodating
the 3-year carryforward and carryback of credits for light trucks after the elimination of the two-fleet requirement.
Only Chrysler commented on the proposal, stating that it agreed with the agency. No other comments addressed the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manner in which NHTSA will allow CAFE credits to be carried forward or backward once the captive import and other
fleets are combined is the same as that used by the agency during the transition from 2WD and 4WD standards for MYs 1980&hyph;81
to optional combined standards for MY 1982 and later (45 FR 83233, December 18, 1990), as well as the subsequent termination
of any 2WD/4WD option in favor of a single combined standard for all configurations in MY 1992 (55 FR 12487, April 4,
1990). For MY's 1993&hyph;95, a manufacturer's captive import and other light truck credits can be applied to offset
shortfalls in the combined fleet incurred up to three model years later (i.e., MYs 1996&hyph;98). If, on the other
hand, a manufacturer wished to use credits earned in the three years after elimination of the two-fleet requirement
to offset a shortfall incurred between MY 1993 and MY 1995, the manufacturer would have to separate its MYs 1996&hyph;98
CAFE credits into ``captive import'' and ``other'' components based on each fraction of the fleet's share of total
production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that it does not foresee any manufacturer making use of carryforward or carryback credits for captive
imports, however. As mentioned above, in the relevant years, only Chrysler has had even a minimal number of captive
imports, and it has not needed to use any credits during that time. Nor does the agency expect any manufacturer to establish
a captive import fleet in the MY 1996&hyph;98 timeframe.

VI. The Need of the Nation To Conserve Energy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The import share reached 36.8 percent in 1975, the year
EPCA was passed, and peaked at 46.4 percent in 1977, at a cost of $91 billion (stated in 1992 dollars). Although the share
declined to below 30 percent in the mid-1980's, lately the United States has again become increasingly dependent
on imported oil. Over 40 percent of the country's petroleum needs have been imported in every year since 1988. In 1992,
imports totaled 43.6 percent. Sharply lower oil prices in the past decade, however, cut the value of oil imports to
$50.5 billion in 1992.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the percentage of imported oil purchased from OPEC sources, which peaked at 70 percent in 1977, and declined
to a low of 36 percent in 1985, has been steadily rising since then, and has been over 50 percent every year since 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average cost of crude oil imports jumped from $4.08 per barrel in 1973 to $12.52 in 1974 as a result of the oil embargo
against selected countries, including the United States, by Arab members of OPEC. Additional increases in the cost
of oil occurred in 1979&hyph;80, due to unrest in Iran (which eliminated a substantial portion of that country's oil
output), and in 1980&hyph;81, when the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war reduced supply from the area. In 1981, the United
States adopted a policy of reliance on market forces and decontrolled the price of oil. Since 1981, prices have fallen
as conservation efforts continue. In 1990&hyph;91, petroleum prices were affected by the conflict in the Persian
Gulf. In the beginning of 1992, the continued worldwide economic recession and high levels of crude oil production
by OPEC member countries together held down oil prices. The average refiner acquisition cost of imported crude oil
in 1992 was $17.75 per barrel, which was 4.2 percent below the average 1991 level (in 1992 dollars). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current energy situation and emerging trends point to the continued importance of oil conservation. The United
States now imports a higher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and the percentage
of its oil supplied by OPEC is similar to that of 1975. Oil continues to account for over 40 percent of all energy used
in the United States, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportation sector. Despite legislation such
as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California's strict ``clean fuel'' and emissions standards, gasoline
will likely remain the predominant fuel in the transportation sector. Domestic oil production has declined steadily
since reaching a peak of 10.6 million barrels per day in 1985 and dropping to 9.0 million barrels per day in 1992. Domestic
production is expected to continue declining by roughly 200,000 barrels per day each year through the year 2000. While
the United States is currently the world's second largest oil producer, it contains only about three percent of the
world's known oil reserves. Persian Gulf countries contain 63 percent of known world reserves, and former communist
countries contain 9 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Long-term projections of petroleum prices, supply, and demand are now influenced by a wide range of uncertainties
associated with sweeping economic and political changes in the former U.S.S.R. and in Eastern Europe, environmental
issues, and the role of Middle East countries in determining the world's future oil supplies and prices, and future
energy demands in populous developing countries. The Department of Energy projects that oil prices will be between
$14 and $30 (1992 dollars) per barrel in the year 2000, and will rise to between $19 and $39 per barrel by 2010. DOE projects
a continuing decline in domestic oil production to between 3.54 and 6.73 million barrels per day in 2010, with imports
rising to between 52 percent and 72 percent of total use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of petroleum imports is only one aspect of the total energy conservation picture. Under EPCA and NEPA, for
example, national security, energy independence, resource conservation, and environmental protection must all
be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1987, the Department of Energy submitted a report to the President entitled ``Energy Security.'' NHTSA believes
that the following quotation from that report continues to represent a useful summary of the national security and
energy independence aspects of the current energy situation:

Although dependence on insecure oil supplies is *&blank;*&blank;* projected to grow, energy security depends in
part on the ability of importing nations to respond to oil supply disruptions; and this is improving. The decontrol
of oil prices in the United States, as well as similar moves in other countries, has made economies more adaptable to
changing situations. Furthermore, the large strategic oil reserves that have been established in the United States
(and to a lesser extent, in other major oil-importing nations) will make it possible to respond far more effectively
to any future disruptions than has been the case in the past. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current world energy situation and the outlook for the future include both opportunities and risks. The oil price
drop of 1986 showed how consumers can be helped by a more competitive oil market. If adequate supplies of oil and other
energy resources continue to be available at reasonable prices, this will provide a boost to a world economy. At the
same time, the projected increase in reliance on relatively few oil suppliers implies certain risks for the United
States and the free world. These risks can be summarized as follows: If a small group of leading oil producers can dominate
the world's energy markets, this could result in artificially high prices (or just sharp upward and downward price
swings), which would necessitate difficult economic adjustments and cause hardships to all consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revolutions, regional wars, or aggression from outside powers could disrupt a large volume of oil supplies from the
Persian Gulf, inflicting severe damage on the economies of the United States and allied nations. Oil price increases
precipitated by the 1978&hyph;79 Iranian revolution contributed to the largest recession since the 1930's. Similar
or larger events in the future could have far-reaching economic, geopolitical, or even military implications.

Based on the above, NHTSA concludes that there is a continuing need for the nation to conserve energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in market share of light trucks points to the need for enhanced fuel economy for this class of vehicle.
Light trucks are less fuel efficient and are driven more miles over their lifetime than passenger automobiles. Currently,
more than half of the energy in the transportation sector is used by light-duty vehicles (automobiles and light trucks).
Light trucks have steadily increased their share of petroleum use in the transportation sector. In 1973, light trucks
accounted for approximately 12 percent of transportation petroleum use, a figure which increased to roughly 20 percent
by 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light trucks meeting the MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard will be more fuel-efficient than the average vehicle in the current
light truck fleet in service, thus making a positive contribution to petroleum conservation.

VII. Determining the Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, section 502(b) requires that light truck fuel economy standards be set at the maximum feasible
average fuel economy level. In making this determination, the agency must consider the four factors of section 502(e):
technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel
economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Interpretation of ``Feasible'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar language in other statutes, the agency has in the past
interpreted ``feasible'' to refer to whether something is capable of being done. The agency has thus concluded in
the past that a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and
(2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking account of what manufacturers are able to do in light
of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average
fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Industry-wide Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer
basis or on an industry-wide basis. Legislative history may be used as an indication of congressional intent in resolving
ambiguities in statutory language. The agency believes that the below-quoted language provides guidance on the
meaning of ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Conference Report to the 1975 Act (S. Rep. No. 94&hyph;516, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 154&hyph;55 (1975)) states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Such determination [of maximum feasible average fuel economy level] should take industry-wide considerations
into account. For example, a determination of maximum feasible average fuel economy should not be keyed to the single
manufacturer which might have the most difficulty achieving a given level of average fuel economy. Rather, the Secretary
must weigh the benefits to the nation of a higher average fuel economy standard against the difficulties of individual
manufacturers. Such difficulties, however, should be given appropriate weight in setting the standard in light
of the small number of domestic manufacturers that currently exist and the possible implications for the national
economy and for reduced competition association [sic] with a severe strain on any manufacturer *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is clear from the Conference Report that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least
capable manufacturer. Rather, NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum
feasible average fuel economy level.

NHTSA has traditionally set light truck standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles
constitute a substantial share of the market. The agency did set the MY 1982 light truck fuel economy standards at a
level which it recognized might be above the maximum feasible fuel economy capability of Chrysler, based on the conclusion
that the energy benefits associated with the higher standard would outweigh the harm to Chrysler. 45 FR 20871, 20876,
March 31, 1980. However, as the agency noted in deciding not to set the MYs 1983&hyph;85 light truck standards above
Ford's level of capability, Chrysler had only 10&hyph;15 percent of the light truck domestic sales, while Ford had
about 35 percent. 45 FR 81593, 81599, December 11, 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Petroleum Consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The energy savings that could result from the MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard can be illustrated by considering the potential
effects of a standard set at different levels. Since Ford and Chrysler project CAFE levels for both MY 1996 and 1997
above 20.7 mpg, a standard set at 20.7 mpg would not likely have any effect on those companies. Since GM currently projects
a CAFE level of 20.5 mpg for both model years, a standard set at 20.7 mpg, the level NHTSA has determined to be GM's capability,
would encourage it to achieve a higher CAFE level. If a 20.7 mpg standard resulted in GM achieving a CAFE level 0.2 mpg
above its current projection, there would be a savings of 102 million gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of GM's
fleet for each model year. (This assumes GM would sell the same number of light trucks in MY 1996 and MY 1997 as it did in
MY 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential savings associated with a MY 1996&hyph;97 standard above 20.7 mpg are highly uncertain. Assume, for
example, that a standard could be set at 21.2 mpg, 0.5 mpg above GM's capability for both model years and 0.4 mpg above
Chrysler's capability for MY 1996 and 0.2 mpg above its capability for MY 1997. Since Ford projects CAFE levels of 21.1
mpg and 21.6 mpg for MY 1996&hyph;97, such standards would likely have little or no impact on that company. GM and Chrysler
could likely meet the levels of the standards only by restricting the sales of their large light trucks. If this occurred,
consumers might tend to keep their older, less-fuel efficient light trucks in service longer. Also, consumers might
purchase still larger trucks that are not subject to CAFE standards. Therefore, the agency believes that any additional
energy savings associated with alternative higher fuel economy standards above 20.7 mpg (the level the agency has
determined to be GM's capability) would be uncertain and speculative.

As indicated above, most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle
portion of the light truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those companies. Only
three light truck manufacturers, Range Rover, PAS and UMC, are expected to have fuel economy levels lower than the
major domestic manufacturers. Since these companies have an extremely small market share, NHTSA concludes that
setting a standard based on their capabilities would be inconsistent with a determination of maximum feasibility
that takes industry-wide considerations into account, as required by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales
for MYs 1996&hyph;97. NHTSA also concludes that 20.7 mpg is the maximum feasible standard for both MYs 1996 and 1997.
For the reasons discussed below, this level balances the potential petroleum savings associated with a higher standard
against the difficulties of manufacturers facing a potentially higher standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that a 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will make a positive contribution
to petroleum conservation by encouraging GM, which has a large market share, to achieve a higher CAFE level than it
currently projects while remaining within its fuel economy capability. The agency notes that a 20.7 mpg standard
is 0.2 mpg higher than GM's current MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE projection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 20.7 mpg standard will not unduly restrict consumer choice or have adverse economic impacts on the large domestic
manufacturers. The current product plans of Ford and Chrysler indicate that they expect to achieve MYs 1996&hyph;97
CAFE levels that are above 20.7 mpg. Therefore, they will not have to make any changes in their product plans to achieve
the level of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While GM's current product plan shows expected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFEs of 20.5 mpg in each model year, NHTSA's analysis
indicates that company can achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both years. As discussed above, this conclusion is based on
the following assumptions: (1) The 4WD share of the market will not significantly increase between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97,
(2) GM will make successful efforts to maintain market share of certain vehicles, (3) GM can make minor changes in the
performance levels of its vehicles to bring them more in line with its competitors, and (4) GM can make small improvements
by increasing the penetration of some engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for
full implementation. All of these actions are very minor and, the agency believes, within GM's capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that a higher standard than 20.7 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97 could result in serious economic difficulties
for GM. While GM can achieve 20.7 mpg CAFE without significant product restrictions, such restrictions could be required
to achieve a CAFE higher than 20.7 mpg. Given leadtime constraints, NHTSA believes that the first potential fuel-efficiency
actions that GM or any other manufacturer would consider in response to a higher standard would consist of marketing
actions. For the reasons discussed in other notices, however, the agency does not believe that marketing actions
can be relied upon to significantly improve a manufacturer's CAFE. See, e.g., MY 1993&hyph;94 light truck CAFE final
rule (56 FR 13775, April 4, 1991). If such marketing actions were unsuccessful in whole or in part, GM would likely have
to engage in significant product restrictions to achieve the level of a higher CAFE standard. Such product restrictions
could result in adverse economic consequences for GM, its employees and the economy as a whole and limit consumer choice,
especially with regard to the load-carrying needs of light truck purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, while NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of
sales, the agency believes that GM's capability is not significantly below that of Chrysler. GM and Chrysler, combined,
sell over 50 percent of all new light trucks each model year. Therefore, even if the agency were to set a standard above
GM's capability, the standard could not be much above 20.7 mpg and still remain within the capability of the majority
of the industry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that the 20.7 mpg standard balances the potentially serious adverse economic consequences for GM
that could result from a higher standard with the potential for increased petroleum savings. The agency concludes,
in view of the statutory requirement to consider specified factors, that the relatively small and uncertain energy
savings associated with setting a standard above GM's capability would not justify the potential harm to that company
and the economy as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Alert and CEI requested that NHTSA consider the safety effects of its decision. Those commenters stated
that the agency should not in any way avoid analyzing the potential safety consequences of a decision to increase the
CAFE standards for light trucks. Consumer Alert and CEI cited the record of NHTSA's rulemaking concerning the MY 1990
passenger car CAFE standard, although they recognized that the safety consequences of a decision to raise the CAFE
standard for light trucks may differ somewhat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of passenger car CAFE standards, NHTSA has recognized that CAFE standards could adversely affect safety
to the extent that they result in significant reductions in car size and/or weight. This issue was discussed at length
in the agency's notice terminating rulemaking on the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard (see 58 FR 6939, February
3, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of the extent to which significantly higher light truck CAFE standards could affect safety is more complex
than for passenger car standards, since purchasers would have many more options for substitution (e.g., different
kinds of light trucks, trucks with a high enough GVWR that they are not subject to CAFE standards, etc.) The agency notes
that since light trucks are generally significantly larger and heavier than passenger cars, any safety effects of
a particular weight reduction would likely be smaller than for cars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NHTSA recognizes that significantly higher light truck CAFE standards could adversely affect safety, to the
extent that they resulted in significant reductions in light truck size and/or weight, the available evidence indicates
that MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard of 20.7 mpg will not have any impact on safety. NHTSA notes that, in setting the light
truck CAFE standards for recent model years, the agency did not include in its analyses of manufacturer capabilities
any product plan actions that would significantly affect the weight, size or cost of the vehicles the manufacturers
planned to offer. The agency also notes that the average equivalent test weight of light trucks has increased from
3,805 pounds in MY 1984 to 4,169 pounds in MY 1992. Therefore, NHTSA believes that CAFE standards during this period
have not had any measurable effect on light truck weight or size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that the levels of the light truck CAFE standards have not varied significantly for more than
a decade. The light truck CAFE standards for MY 1987&hyph;89 and MY 1994 were set at 20.5 mpg, and, as far back as MY 1984,
the standard was 20.0 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA therefore believes that the size and weight of current and planned light trucks are not significantly different
from what would have occurred in the absence of CAFE standards. As discussed above, Ford and Chrysler will exceed the
level of the 20.7 mpg standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 without making any changes in their product plans. While GM will
need to make some changes in its product plan to achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg, the agency does not believe that it is necessary,
or likely, for that company to take actions that would have any adverse effect on safety, in order to achieve that CAFE
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, in determining that GM can achieve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels of 20.7 mpg, NHTSA adjusted GM's
projected CAFE level of 20.5 mpg based on several factors. First, the agency adjusted it upward to reflect more realistic
mix assumptions with respect to 4WD market share and maintaining market share of certain more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Since this adjustment simply reflects the agency's judgment of what GM is likely to be able to sell, based on historical
experience, the adjustment does not induce or compel any actions with safety implications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also concluded that GM can improve its projected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by a slight reduction in vehicle performance.
This would involve changes in such things as axle ratios. The agency believes that a slight reduction in performance
would not have any adverse safety consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency concluded that GM could improve its MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by increasing the penetration of some
engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for full implementation. This action would
not result in reduced vehicle weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will not lead to significant reductions in light
truck size or weight, or shifts toward less safe vehicles, the agency concludes that it is not likely to have any impact
on safety.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has considered the impact this rulemaking will have on small
entities. I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this action. No light truck manufacturer subject
to the standard will be classified as a ``small business'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In the case of other
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which purchase light trucks, the standard
will not affect the availability of the full range of light trucks or have a significant effect on the overall cost of
purchasing and operating light trucks.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,

This final rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 509(a) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost
Savings Act (the Cost Savings Act; 15 U.S.C. 2009(a)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle fuel economy standard is in
effect, a state may not adopt or enforce any law or regulation relating to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy
standards applicable to vehicles covered by the Federal standard. Under section 509(b) of the Cost Savings Act (15
U.S.C. 2009(b)) a state may not require fuel economy labels on vehicles covered by section 506 of the Cost Savings Act
(15 U.S.C. 2006) which are not identical to the Federal standard. Section 509 does not apply to vehicles procured for
the State's use. Section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final
rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal average fuel economy standards. That section does not require
submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in
court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is revising portions of the general industry safety standards
addressing personal protective equipment (PPE). The standards being revised include those containing general
requirements for all PPE (1910.132) and standards that set design, selection, and use requirements for specific
types of PPE (eye, face, head, foot and hand). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is updating the standards for PPE to be more consistent with the current consensus regarding good industry
practices, as reflected by the latest editions of the pertinent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.
The revision will provide guidance for the selection and use of PPE as well as clearer requirements that are performance-oriented,
where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 New paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) (containing requirements covering equipment selection, defective and damaged
equipment, and training, respectively) have been added to 1910.132. Also, a new section (1910.138) has been added
to this Subpart to address hazards to the hands. Non-mandatory appendices A and B have also been added to this Subpart
to provide additional guidance to employers and employees with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing OSHA standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) are contained in Subpart I of OSHA's general
industry standards. These standards were adopted in 1971 from established Federal standards and national consensus
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing a proposed revision of Subpart I, the Agency performed a comprehensive review of the PPE standards.
This review revealed several limitations and concerns with respect to these standards. First, OSHA determined that
many of the existing PPE standards were outdated since they reflected knowledge and practices regarding PPE as they
existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This meant that employers were being required to explain how compliance
with more recent editions of the pertinent consensus standards provides equivalent protection to that provided
by the older editions in the OSHA standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Agency determined that there were certain gaps in coverage of the PPE standards, and that the standards
set very restrictive design criteria which might limit the use of new technology. OSHA was concerned that restraints
on innovation might also make it more difficult for employers either to increase acceptance of PPE, or to provide more
protective PPE. Recognizing this situation, the Agency established a process under which OSHA has accepted, for
example, on a case-by-case basis, the use of eye protection which, while not designed to meet the specifications in
the existing standards, had been demonstrated to provide equivalent or superior worker protection. The Agency determined,
however, that this process could not keep pace with the development of improved PPE. Consequently, OSHA was concerned
that, unless the PPE standards were revised to be more performance-oriented, employers and product manufacturers
might be discouraged from improving their equipment and from providing improved protection to workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA had obtained injury data and technical reports which showed that injuries were occurring to employees
who were wearing PPE as well as to those employees who were not wearing PPE. This indicated that, in some cases, significant
improvements in PPE design and acceptance might be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these concerns, OSHA developed a proposed revision to its PPE standards. The proposed revision was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33832). OSHA proposed to revise the safety standards
for eye and face protection (1910.133); head protection (1910.135); and foot protection (1910.136) by referencing
the latest editions of the corresponding standards published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
The provisions of existing 1910.134 and 1910.137 (which cover respiratory protection and electrical protective
devices, respectively) are the subjects of separate rulemaking actions and are not addressed by this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also proposed to revise the ``general requirements'' for PPE (1910.132) by adding provisions that: (1) require
employers to select appropriate PPE based on the hazards present and to assure that employees who obtain their own
PPE follow the employers' selection decisions; (2) prohibit the use of defective or damaged PPE; and (3) require that
employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM set a period, that ended on October 16, 1990, during which interested persons could comment on the proposal
and request a hearing. OSHA received 129 comments in response to the proposal (Exhibit 3). The Agency also received
several requests for an informal public hearing to discuss and clarify some of the requirements in the proposal, and
to discuss and comment on issues and concerns raised as a result of the proposal. Accordingly, OSHA published a hearing
notice on February 1, 1990 (55 FR 3412). The hearing notice requested testimony and supporting information on the
following issues: (1) Marking of eye and face protection; (2) Third party certification; (3) The use of photochromic
lenses; (4) Training in the proper use of PPE; and (5) The need for additional regulation of PPE (such as gloves, chemical
protective clothing, and bump caps). The hearing notice (55 FR 3412) also extended the comment period until March
20, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hearings on the proposed standard were held in Washington, D.C., on April 3 and 4, 1990, with Administrative Law Judge
Sheldon R. Lipson presiding. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Lipson set July 13, 1990, as the deadline for submission
of post hearing comments and evidence, and September 11, 1990, as the deadline for submission of summations and briefs.
On November 9, 1990, Judge Lipson certified the hearing record, including the hearing transcript and all written
submissions to the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains 173 comments, 577 pages of testimony, and 53 exhibits.

II. Workplace Hazards Involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has determined that workers involved in a wide range of occupations are exposed to a significant risk of death
or injury from being struck by various objects in the workplace. OSHA's incident data indicate that a significant
portion of all work related injuries and fatalities involve workers being struck in the eyes, head, face, hand, and
or feet by foreign objects. For example, it has been estimated that as many as 2,500 eye injuries occur in the workplace
every working day (Ex. 2: 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One study indicated that there were 333,272 reported occupational eye injuries for 1985 (Ex. 2: 8). Another study,
pertaining to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
disabling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 injuries, estimated that there were 320,000 hand and finger injuries, 70,000 eye injuries, 70,000 head and face injuries,
and 110,000 foot and toe injuries in 1987. These injuries constituted 31.7 percent of the estimated 1,800,000 total
disabling work injuries for 1987 (Ex. 2: 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These examples indicate the degree of the hazard to which employees are exposed. OSHA reviewed many sources that described
the type and number of injuries to employees (e.g. Ex. 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22; Ex.
6: 2, 3, 4). While these sources differ as to the number and kind of injuries, they are consistent in pointing out the
high incidence and severity of these accidents, and provide clear evidence of a significant risk to workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, one data source reviewed by OSHA included the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Work Injury Reports
(WIR) on eye, face, foot, head and hand injuries (Ex. 2: 11, 12, 13, 14; Ex. 6: 2). These reports, which examined only
those cases where a worker was injured, identified two major factors: Personal protective equipment was not being
worn the vast majority of the time; and, when some type of protective equipment was worn, it did not fully protect the
worker. For example, one study (Ex. 6: 2) indicated that 70% of the workers experiencing hand injuries were not wearing
gloves. Hand injuries to the remaining 30% of the workers who were wearing gloves were caused by the gloves being either
inadequate, damaged, or the wrong type for the type of hazard present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above-documented incidence of hand injury, OSHA has determined that employers and employees need more
guidance regarding the selection of hand protection than is provided through the generic provisions of proposed
1910.132(d). Therefore, as discussed below, the Agency has provided performance-oriented provisions by adding
1910.138, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hand protection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule addresses the problems identified in the BLS reports by allowing new innovative designs through the
use of performance-oriented language, by providing information for selecting the proper protection, and by improving
the protection afforded by the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the revised standards will result in improvement in worker acceptance of wearing PPE by allowing
better and more comfortable designs not presently permitted by the current standards, and by providing information
on selecting the proper equipment for the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that compliance with the final rule will result in a significant reduction in the risks to
workers. As noted in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, discussed below, it is estimated that full compliance with the
final rule will prevent 712,000 lost-workdays and 4 fatalities a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has also determined that the revised PPE requirements and criteria in the final rule provide a cost-effective
means for reducing risks to workers. The Agency has determined that these provisions are reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the need for personal protective equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains an analysis of the rulemaking record pertaining to certain issues raised in the NPRM, and to
the provisions of the standard, both as proposed and as promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One general objection received during this rulemaking concerned the use of the phrase ``employers shall ensure''
in certain provisions of the proposed standard (e.g. Ex. 3: 46, 80, 94). The commenters expressed the view that, under
the proposed language, employers would be held liable for violations of the standards, regardless of employee misconduct
or other exculpatory considerations. The Agency had proposed the language in question to emphasize the employer's
obligations for compliance with OSHA standards. The proposed language would not have affected an employer's ability
to raise defenses to a citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the objections, OSHA is revising the proposed language to remove the phrase ``the employer shall ensure''
wherever it appears. The employer's obligations for compliance with standards issued under the OSH Act are unaffected
by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, concern was expressed regarding the extent to which the proposed standard would allow employees to use PPE that
satisfied the old ANSI standards which were being superseded by current editions through the proposal. In particular,
some commenters (Ex. 3: 68, 69, 100) suggested that the Agency ``grandfather'' existing stocks of PPE (i.e., allow
existing stocks of PPE to be depleted) as long as the PPE meets the ANSI standard in effect at the time of manufacture.
Those commenters stated that, without grandfathering, employers would be required to bear the unreasonable expense
and disruption of replacing millions of items of usable PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal simply required the affected PPE to comply with the then-current editions of the pertinent ANSI standards,
without indicating how PPE produced and tested to satisfy the existing OSHA standards would be treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that virtually all of the PPE in question has been produced and tested to satisfy the ANSI editions
referenced in either the proposed rule or in the final rule. Therefore, OSHA believes that, by and large, existing
stocks of PPE would comply with the final rule. However, the Agency recognizes that some PPE that pre-dates the referenced
ANSI standards might be unnecessarily excluded from use unless it was ``grandfathered''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, certain protective footwear that complied with the 1983 ANSI edition referenced by the proposal could
be excluded from use because it was not produced and tested to satisfy the 1991 edition referenced by the final rule,
unless the employer demonstrated that the footwear provided equivalent protection. OSHA believes that the differences
between the 1983 and 1991 editions are so slight that it would be unreasonable to require employers to demonstrate
equivalency. The Agency also believes that PPE satisfying the pertinent criteria of the pre-1989 ANSI Z87.1 standard
for eye and face protection or the pre-1986 Z89.1 standard for head protection will adequately protect affected employees.
Therefore, the Agency agrees that it is appropriate to allow continued use of PPE that was purchased prior to the effective
date of the final rule and has revised the proposed rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, as in the NPRM, OSHA has incorporated the pertinent ANSI standards by reference. The Agency has determined
that it is unnecessary to adopt the text of the three ANSI standards, because their criteria are addressed to PPE manufacturers,
not to employers who would be selecting PPE for use by their employees. OSHA believes that it is sufficient to require
that employers ensure either that the PPE used by employees complies with the appropriate ANSI standard or that the
PPE provides protection equivalent to that provided by PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria.

1910.132 General Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section were not proposed for revision. Paragraph (a) requires that protective
equipment be provided, used and maintained in sanitary and reliable condition, as necessary, to protect employees
from workplace hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) requires that, where employees provide their own equipment, the employer assure the adequacy, including
the proper maintenance and sanitation, of such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) requires that all personal protective equipment be of safe design and construction for the work to be
performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d): Selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (d), to 1910.132 to address the selection of PPE. OSHA proposed to require employers
to select the PPE for their employees based on an assessment of the hazards in the workplace, and the hazards which employees
are likely to encounter. Because OSHA is aware that some employees obtain their own PPE, the Agency also proposed that
employers be required to inform their employees of the selection decisions and to have their employees follow those
decisions when obtaining PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information
needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The
Agency believes that the employer will be capable of determining and evaluating the hazards of a particular workplace.
Paragraph (d) of the final rule is a performance-oriented provision which simply requires employers to use their
awareness of workplace hazards to enable them to select the appropriate PPE for the work being performed. Paragraph
(d) clearly indicates that the employer is accountable both for the quality of the hazard assessment and for the adequacy
of the PPE selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d), which was substantively identical to the final rule, has been revised for the sake of clarity.
The Agency has also added a note which references Non-mandatory Appendix B of 1910.132. That Appendix provides an
example of procedures that satisfy the hazard assessment requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most rulemaking participants supported the proposed requirement (e.g. Ex. 3: 90, 91, 102). However, some commenters
stated that the proposed paragraph did not clearly indicate if employers would be required to document the hazard
assessment. For example, a commenter from S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. (Ex. 3: 1) suggested that OSHA clarify documentation
requirements of the workplace assessment. In addition, a commenter from Union Carbide (Ex. 3: 68, pp. 1&hyph;2) stated:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;OSHA should clarify that the hazard assessment referred to there need not be in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA can best determine whether the employer conducted an adequate hazard assessment by inspecting the areas where
PPE is required. It should not be necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance officers and affected employees with appropriate
assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed. The Agency agrees with the commenter that it is
not ``necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.'' Given the performance-oriented
nature of this rulemaking, OSHA has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be
unnecessarily burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has addressed such situations in other rulemakings by requiring employers to verify their compliance
with a requirement through a written certification. For example, OSHA has required certification of training in
the permit-required confined space standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout)
standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); in the Telecommuni-cations standard, 1910.268(c); and (as discussed below) in
1910.132(f)(4) of this final rule. The Agency has found that a written certification is a reasonable means by which
to establish accountability for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(d) of the final
rule through a written certification which identifies the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the evaluation
has been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identifies the document as a certification of
hazard assessment. This requirement has been added to the final rule as paragraph (d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect
``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j))
specifies that ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not generally include *&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden
other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.''
OSHA has determined that the certification required by paragraph (d)(2) constitutes a ``certification'' for the
purposes of the PRA. Therefore, that certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction
Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR part 1320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern raised during this rulemaking, related to the selection process, was the subject of proper fit of
PPE. A commenter (Ex. 7:10) has stated that, in the past, males constituted the majority of the workforce and PPE was
sized accordingly. As more and more females have entered the workforce, they often have had to choose between wearing
PPE that was sized to fit males, and not wearing PPE at all. This was particularly common with foot protection. As a result,
female workers frequently either have used PPE which did not adequately protect them, or have simply stopped using
PPE because of improper fit and subsequent discomfort. Based on concern for the safety of female employees, the commenter
suggested that OSHA require PPE to fit properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with this comment. Since females constitute a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before, it
is imperative that they (as well as male employees) be provided with PPE that fits properly. Therefore, OSHA is revising
1910.132 (d) to add proper fit as a criterion for PPE selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e): Defective and damaged equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (e), to 1910.132 that stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Defective or damaged personal protective equipment shall not be used.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph is based, in part, on existing 1910.133 (a)(2)(vii), which states that eye protectors should be kept
clean and in good repair. Under the proposed paragraph, the existing requirement was to be strengthened and extended
to cover all PPE, not just eye protectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 41) stated that proposed paragraph (e) should only cover visually observable defects
or damage. For example, a commenter from Johnson Wax (Ex. 3: 1) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA to limit the scope of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ``visible'' defects or damage in PPE.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA certainly agrees that visibly damaged or defective PPE must not be used. However, there are other methods (such
as performance tests to ensure continued integrity) that the employer could use to assure that the PPE used by employees
is repaired or replaced as necessary for the protection of each affected employee. Also, employees can often determine
if the protectiveness of the PPE has been compromised when they are handling the PPE prior to or while donning it. Accordingly,
OSHA believes it would be inappropriate to narrow this provision to cover only visible defects or damage. Therefore,
the Agency is promulgating paragraph 1910.132 (e) as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f): Training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (f) required employers to train employees in the proper use of their PPE. This proposed provision
was based on OSHA's recognition that, as documented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Reports (Ex. 2: 11,
12, 13, 14), a significant number of the employees who sustain work-related injuries have not been trained in the proper
use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (Ex. 3: 64, 117, 119) stated that PPE training, while necessary for respirators and other complex
PPE, is not necessary for relatively simple equipment such as safety shoes and eye protectors. In particular, the
American Trucking Association (ATA) (Ex. 3: 64) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring training and record-keeping for all PPE would severely burden motor carriers in terms of time and the related
costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, the ATA suggested that OSHA set non-mandatory appendices for the guidance of employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 84, 104, 121) suggested that the employer be required to train employees only for use of the
PPE that is required by the employer to provide protection against hazards identified for the particular workplace.
The Texas Chemical Council (Ex. 3: 121) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring the employer to train employees on equipment they provide creates an unnecessary and inappropriate burden
on the employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 83, 90, 106, 126) supported the training requirement, as proposed. Du Pont (Ex. 3: 90,
pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Du Pont's position is that proper employee training is fundamental to an effective PPE program. We also agree with
the flexibility this proposed section provides employers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 100, 104) suggested that OSHA revise the proposed paragraph (f) to indicate that training
need only be provided when PPE is first provided to employees. For example, Union Electric (Ex. 3: 100) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Company suggests adding ``at the time it is initially issued.'' The proposal, as written, could imply that employees
must be periodically retrained in the proper use of their equipment. This certainly is unnecessary for such items
as safety glasses, footwear and headgear, which usually are worn routinely on the job. Respirators already have a
periodic training requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, several commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 64, 102, 117) expressed concern that proposed 1910.132(f) would require employers
to operate formal training programs. For example, Monsanto (Ex. 3: 102, pg. 2) stated that OSHA should revise proposed
paragraph (f) to indicate clearly that the training required need not be formal classroom training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) inquired: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to training all employees in the proper use of all PPE, what would qualify as ``training''? The term ``training''
could range from awareness type information to competency training of the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should define the term ``training'' or be specific in individual standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 81, 119) stated that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to require ``instruction''
rather than ``training''. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) (Ex. 3: 81, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training is too elaborate a term for the degree of explanation required with PPE. More sophisticated PPE such as respirators
or hearing protection, which require detailed training, is already provided for by certain OSHA standards. MVMA
recommends that subparagraph (f) be retitled ``Instruction'' and the term ``training'' be changed to ``instructed''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some public hearing participants testified in support of the proposed 1910.132(f) performance-oriented approach
to training. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) testified (Tr. 159: 4/3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* CMA agrees that training is an essential element of an effective personal protective equipment
program. We believe, however, that OSHA should continue to address training with performance-oriented provisions,
not with HAZWOPER-type training requirements. Not only are additional requirements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 necessary, they would be over-burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, many commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 36, 41, 50, 60, 73, 86, 98, 116, 128) suggested that OSHA revise proposed
1910.132(f) to provide more detailed guidance regarding what constitutes adequate training. For example, CSX Transportation
(Ex. 3: 116) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the performance requirements for a PPE training program should be included under 1910.132(f), since
training is the responsibility of the employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 123 and 128) emphasized that ``personal'' training is important to a successful training
program. For example, the Food &amp; Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128, pg. 6) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is imperative that this training be conducted by ``live'' personnel who will be available to answer questions that
workers may have. Simply showing a twenty minute video tape shall not constitute adequate training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and care'' of PPE. For example, the
Edison Electric Institute (EEI) (Ex. 3: 73, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To further enhance the protection provided by the standard, EEI recommends amending proposed 1910.132(f) to require
employees to be trained not only in the use of their equipment, but also in its care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, some commenters (Ex. 3: 41, 59, 128) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and limitations''
of PPE. The Food &amp; Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128) stated that training in the limitations of PPE is needed ``to
prevent accidents from occurring due to overconfidence in the protective ability of certain types of equipment.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 60, 107&hyph;D) suggested that employees be trained regarding PPE limitations and precautions.
The American Optometric Association (Ex. 3: 60) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that Section 1910.132(f) on training requirements goes far enough to ensure that any limitations
or precautions provided by the manufacturer of the protector are transmitted to the user and care is taken to see that
such limitations are strictly observed. In addition, we do not believe that appendix B Non-Mandatory Compliance
Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment Selection adequately addresses this area.
There is no guarantee that the training provided employees in the use of eye and face protectors will uniformly cover
the limitations and precautions relating to the use of protectors unless specific requirements for this training
are given. We strongly urge that language making this a mandatory part of training be included in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some other commenters (Ex. 3: 74, 88) suggested that training include information provided by PPE manufacturers.
For example, CF Industries, Inc. (CF) (Ex. 3: 74) objected to the proposed replacement of existing 1910.133(a)(5)
(which requires employers to pass on to employees any information received from manufacturers regarding the limitations
and precautions to be considered when using eye and face protection) by proposed 1910.132(f). The commenter stated:
``CF believes that the proposed section is too broad. Various pieces of personal protective equipment can be used
for the same purpose, but have very different limitations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, two commenters from the State of Connecticut (Ex. 3: 50, 51) stated that ``the final rule for 1910.132(f) should
lean towards being more specific'' and that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to provide that ``Employees
shall be trained in the proper use, maintenance, care, warning labels and limitations of their personal protective
equipment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should be revised to incorporate the specific
training requirements of existing 1910.120, the standard for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (HAZWOPER). For example, the Emergency Response Management &amp; Training Corporation (Ex. 3: 97) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As it [proposed 1910.132(f)] is currently written there are no specifications as to the quality or quantity of training
an employee will receive on the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment. The inclusion of specific
knowledge requirements and competency demonstration may assist in the goal of improving worker safety in hazardous
environments. 29 CFR 1910.120 and NFPA 472&hyph;1989 (Standard for Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous
Materials Incidents) are two examples of this type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the concerns expressed regarding what constitutes adequate training, OSHA requested testimony in Issue
4 of the hearing notice (54 FR 3414, February 1, 1990) on the need for additional training requirements. In particular,
Issue 4 indicated that OSHA was considering the promulgation of more specific training requirements, including
provisions similar to those in existing 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).
The Agency also solicited input regarding what training is needed; how training can be evaluated; when retraining
is necessary; how much time is required for training; what recordkeeping is necessary for training activities; and
what impacts (i.e., costs and benefits) the training requirements would have. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Issue 4, several commenters (Ex. 7: 3, 8, 11, 20, 29, 38) stated that the training requirements should
be more detailed. For example, the General Electric Company (Ex. 7: 3, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Protective equipment training needs to include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Where and how personnel can get the equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A system for identifying the correct equipment for an application *&blank;*&blank;* procedures and operating
manuals should include specifics on protective equipment types, needs and objectives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Equipment should be shown to individuals prior to using each for the first time *&blank;*&blank;* let them touch
and try the items on, the more senses you allow one to use during training the better the person will recall what he/she
learned, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Persons should not be considered competent in protective equipment items until they do a practical test *&blank;*&blank;*
 are able to properly put on the item, explain what protection it provides, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, Boeing (Ex. 7: 38) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Boeing supports the position that additional detail be included in 1910.132 regarding training objectives and methods.
Training should be based on the complexity of the protective equipment requirements. For certain protective equipment
(e.g. safety spectacles) training requirements should be minimal or nonexistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, OSHA received testimony in favor of more specific training requirements at the public hearing. For example,
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) testified (Tr. 23&hyph;24: 4/3) that the key elements
of a successful training program are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1) Sensitizing the workers to the need for such protectors and inviting their participation in developing a suitable
plan for affecting PPE use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Clearly defining the written goals of the PPE program in terms of the target behaviors sought (e.g., appropriate
footwear/eyewear/headwear to be worn, in what areas, what kinds of care required). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Explicit rewards or recognition to be given contingent on the workers displaying actions that conform to the aforementioned
positive acts, including knowledge of results or other forms of feedback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4) Each PPE program should have some basis for evaluation (numbers of workers using/not using specified PPE) so that
modifications could be made should the efforts fall short of the stated goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the International Chemical Workers Union testified (Tr. 16: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Who is responsible for training employees in the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment? It
is the employer's responsibility to carry out this training but it is not being done *&blank;*&blank;* Every worker
should be able to determine that the glove being provided to them by their employer is the right one for the chemicals
which they handle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another hearing participant, the National Environmental Training Association (NETA), testified (Tr. 272: 4/4)
that ``the proposal in 132(f) is not performance-oriented, it's too vague and nonspecific.'' NETA also testified
(Tr. 285: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The National Environmental Testing Association feels that if OSHA seriously considers training to be important
in protecting worker safety *&blank;*&blank;* then the language at 29 CFR 1910.132(f) will have to be more specific.
Unless training is based on measurable objectives as OSHA has pointed out in the U.S. Department of Labor publication
OSHA 2254 (Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines) then it can only be effective by coincidence.

Many Issue 4 commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 2, 13, 15, 21, 22) stated that OSHA should not promulgate more detailed training
requirements. Those commenters expressed the belief that performance-oriented proposed 1910.132(f) allowed
employers in general industry the flexibility to implement training programs as needed. For example, Amoco Corporation
(Ex. 7: 21, pg.2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that employees should be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment, since the equipment
may not provide adequate protection if used improperly. We feel, however, that training programs are best left to
each employer to develop on an individualized, site-specific basis. Manufacturers often provide information on
their particular products upon which an instructional program can be based. Employers do need an effective formal
training session when the use of new or significantly different equipment is instituted. This requirement helps
ensure that time is actually dedicated to this purpose, and emphasizes the importance of proper use to the employee.
Training guidance would be helpful, especially to small businesses, but we feel strongly that such guidance should
be of a non-mandatory nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department of the Air Force (Ex. 7: 25) stated that it ``supports locally devised training, rather
than an OSHA legislated program training requirement, as both cost efficient and effective.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, several Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 19, 31, 35) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should not incorporate the HAZWOPER
training requirements, because 1) general industry PPE was used in a broader class of work environments than HAZWOPER-mandated
PPE, and 2) the PPE covered by proposed 1910.132(f) (e.g., eye and face protection, head protection and foot protection)
was much less complex than that covered by HAZWOPER. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 7: 35)
stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Suggestions that would treat Subpart I in a manner similar to paragraph 1910.120 are without justification. There
is no relationship between the training requirements of paragraph 1910.120 (which are directly responsive to the
enabling legislation dealing with hazardous waste sites) and the use of PPE in the controlled environment of a more
typical place of employment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the National Solid Waste Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 2&hyph;3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While NSWMA supports the concept of a structure for training of employees in the use of PPE, we find the use of the Part
1910.120 training requirements for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response as a model for general industry
to be without any justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Section 1910.120 rule was intended to provide specific safety criteria to cover a specific industry segment.
There are other industries with equivalent or higher risks where the use of this section as a model would be appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSWMA suggests that OSHA instead consider a training requirement more closely aligned with the concepts of its Hazard
Communication Standard, wherein the complexity of the program required for compliance would be directly related
to the hazards present. Such a program would require a survey of hazards, establishment of specifications for PPE
to control those hazards, training for employees and documentation of the training, and availability of PPE information
to employees *&blank;*&blank;* In the low-risk example, having donning and doffing procedures formalized provides
no useful function. What is critical is communicating the need for employees to understand the hazards and the need
to utilize PPE on a consistent basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA agrees with commenters that employers need more specific guidance regarding
how to train employees who use PPE. In particular, the Agency has determined that employees need training which enables
them to know, at least: 1) when PPE is necessary; 2) what PPE is necessary; 3) how to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear
PPE; 4) the limitations of the PPE; and 5) the proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (f) so that paragraph (f)(1) of the final rule reads as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer shall provide training, including retraining where appropriate, to each employee who is required by
this section to use PPE. Each such employee shall be trained to know at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) When PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) What PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The limitations of the PPE; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Training Association (NETA) and other rulemaking participants asserted that in order
to have a successful training program, employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
demonstrate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that they have reached those objectives. For example, NETA testified (Tr. 272&hyph;286: 4/4) that in order for training
to be successful, clear and measurable objectives must be set, and employees must demonstrate that the training objectives
have been reached, by showing that they understand the information provided and that they can use the PPE properly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with these remarks and has stated in one of its own publications (OSHA 2254&hyph;1988): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* in order for the training to be as successful as possible, clear and measurable objectives should
be thought out before the training begins. For an objective to be effective, it should identify as precisely as possible
what the individuals will do to demonstrate that they have learned, or that the objective has been reached. They should
also describe the important conditions under which the individual will demonstrate competence and define what constitutes
acceptable performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, paragraph (f)(2) of the final rule requires that each affected employee demonstrate an understanding
of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1), and the ability to use the PPE properly, before being allowed to perform
work requiring the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3) of the final rule requires retraining when changes in workplace conditions or changes in the types
of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete, and when inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or
use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the understanding or skill required by paragraph (f)(2).
This provision, which did not appear in the proposed rule, indicates clearly that employers have an ongoing responsibility
to maintain employee proficiency in the use and care of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments regarding how employers would indicate their compliance with the proposed training
requirement. Some commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 41, 90) noted a statement in the NPRM (54 FR at 33841) that ``the proposal
contains no recordkeeping requirements.'' Those commenters agreed with that approach, expressing the belief that
detailed recordkeeping would impose an unreasonable burden, and requested ``clarification'' that no recordkeeping
for training would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Detroit Edison (Ex. 3: 62), referring to proposed paragraph (f), noted, ``Documented proof of training
is required by other regulation. Is documentation required? OSHA should present a clearer picture of this requirement
or delete it.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, United Technologies (Ex. 3: 96) inquired, ``Will perceived improper use of PPE be deemed by OSHA evidence
of inadequate training in the absence of training documentation?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) stated, ``Even though OSHA has stated to OMB that this NPR does not have any recordkeeping
requirements, what would be required to prove the ``training'' has been performed?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the Midwest Consortium for Hazardous Waste Worker Training (Ex. 3: 49, 59, 98, 123) suggested that OSHA
require employers to document the content of their training programs. For example, Murray State University (Ex.
3: 123) stated, ``Training should be mainly hands-on with appropriate documentation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several commenters (e.g. 3: 46, 75, 88, 116) stated that proposed paragraph (f) would already require
employers to document training. Some of those commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 88) stated simply that, contrary to the statement
in Section VII of the proposed rule, OSHA had proposed to require recordkeeping, so the Agency had a responsibility
to justify the burden and to properly estimate the cost of documentation. Other commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 116) stated
that the documentation was needed to verify compliance with the training requirements, and that OSHA should not impose
extensive recordkeeping requirements. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) stated (Ex.
3: 75): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
CMA agrees with OSHA's determination to omit recordkeeping from the proposed rule. While some form of verification
should be maintained as an indication that training has taken place, specific documentation requirements would
only add to the recordkeeping burden without increased safety benefits for employees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, CSX Transportation (Ex. 3: 116) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In Section 1910.132 a new training requirement exists that will require the establishment of training records for
employees using PPE. While the standard does not specify any recordkeeping requirements, documentation for compliance
purposes is clearly indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, OSHA requested additional comments on the proposed training provision, including information on
the recordkeeping needed to document compliance, in Issue 4 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990). In
particular, Issue 4 indicated that, based on NPRM comments (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97), OSHA was considering training requirements
similar to the HAZWOPER provisions promulgated in 1910.120(e). Section 1910.120(e)(6) requires employers to certify
successful completion of training and to give graduates a written certificate. That provision further provides
that persons who lack such certification shall be prohibited from engaging in hazardous waste operations. In response
to Issue 4, Jackson Products (Ex. 7: 8, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training of employees in the use of PPE should be the central focus of any rules OSHA is promulgating, as this issue has
the highest potential for reducing worker injuries. Documentation of the training programs could follow the existing
guidelines OSHA has developed for hazardous waste operations and employee right to know training, i.e., training
log, employee signature sheet, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, BP America (Ex. 7: 39) stated, ``we feel that the only criteria for successful completion of a training
course can be that the trainee has mastered the information to the instructor's satisfaction. This can be documented
in several ways including written exams and awarding of certificates.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, some Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 13, 19, 25, 31, 35) opposed the adoption of the HAZWOPER training provisions
in proposed paragraph (f). Regarding the applicability of the HAZWOPER recordkeeping requirements, the National
Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress mandated additional regulations in the narrow field of the occupational safety and health of hazardous
waste workers because hazardous waste operations and remediations involve, in OSHA's words, ``unique'' work environments.
54 Fed. Reg. 9312. Congress recognized that such operations involve potential exposure to a number of hazardous health
risks unlike those encountered by employees in general industry activities. Thus, the OSHA standard prohibits work
upon a hazardous waste site by anyone who is not properly OSHA-qualified and OSHA-certified. Certification may be
granted only upon completion of initial training and continuing education courses within a comprehensive and exhaustive
number of areas. See 29 CFR  1910.120(e)(6). These comprehensive standards apply whenever and wherever hazardous
waste workers handle hazardous substances. The occupational safety and health requirements in Section 1910.120
were, accordingly, crafted in response to the Congressional insistence that safety and health standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
more stringent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 than those applied to general industry be fashioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the NSWMA suggested that OSHA model the requirements of proposed 1910.132(f) on the Hazard Communication
Standard. The NSWMA recognized that recordkeeping would be necessary for training, stating: ``In a low-risk situation,
where bump hats and eye shields may be the only devices needed, a simple written program of several pages would suffice.''
In addition, the NSWMA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Companies should not be required under this suggested system to gain prior OSHA certification of individual programs.
Rather, companies should be permitted to certify that they have developed and implemented programs that are consistent
with OSHA approved standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA acknowledges that the proposed training provision implicitly required some method for verifying compliance.
The Agency believes that the discussion of recordkeeping in Issue 4 of the hearing notice provided adequate notice
that OSHA might require employers to create some method of verifying their training activities. Accordingly, based
on the rulemaking record and for the sake of clarity, the Agency is revising proposed paragraph (f) to state explicitly
that employers must verify that they have provided their employees with the requisite training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the information needed to verify compliance, OSHA agrees with the commenters who have stated that it would
be inappropriate to require specific documentation of the training provided. Given the performance-oriented focus
of this rulemaking, the Agency has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be
unnecessarily burdensome. The Agency also notes that the training needs of employees covered by paragraph (f) of
this section (approximately 22 million) are too diverse to enable OSHA to specify the details required for all of their
PPE training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(f)
of the final rule through a written certification. The Agency has determined that a certification record which identifies
each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification of training
in the use of PPE, will provide adequate assurance that the employer has provided the requisite training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that OSHA has also required certification of training in the permit&hyph;required confined space
standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); and,
in the Telecommunications standard, 1910.268(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also notes that such a document will not preclude a citation if the Agency determines that the employees have not,
in fact, been adequately trained. OSHA believes that compliance with this requirement, while imposing a minimal
burden, provides an important benefit because it enables the employer and OSHA to verify the status of training efforts.
Therefore, OSHA is promulgating new 1910.132(f)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect
``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j))
specifies that ``Information does not generally include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary
to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that the certification of training required by paragraph (f)(4) constitutes a ``certification''
for the purposes of the PRA.Therefore, the certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork
Reduction Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1910.133 Eye and face protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1910.133(a) contained general requirements for eye and face protection. Proposed paragraph (a)(1) required
the employer to ensure that employees use appropriate eye or face protection when they are exposed to eye or face hazards
from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acid and caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially
injurious light radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(1) also required that eye protection used by employees provide both front and side protection
from flying objects. This portion of proposed paragraph (a)(1) resulted in many comments. Most rulemaking participants
agreed with OSHA that eye protectors should provide both front and side protection from flying objects (e.g. Ex. 3:
28, 49, 59, 61, 83, 128; Tr. 53: 4/3) because studies (Ex. 2: 11) have indicated that most injuries have occurred (in
those instances when eye protection was used) because flying objects went 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
around
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the protection. However, several rulemaking participants disagreed with this requirement because they believed
that OSHA was proposing that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eye protectors would have to provide side protection (e.g. Ex. 3: 41, 69). For example, a commenter from the Exxon Company
(Ex. 3: 47, pp.1&hyph;2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Exxon is concerned that the proposal could be interpreted to require all safety glasses to be equipped with side shields.
Exxon's position is that many situations exist where safety glasses without side shields are adequate. For such routine
operations, OSHA should not ignore the fact that most employees will be more reluctant to wear safety glasses with
side shields than glasses without side shields. The mandatory use of side shields on all safety glasses could deter
the overall use of safety glasses on and off the job which would ultimately lead to an increase in the total number of
eye injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We concur with OSHA that employees should be equipped with adequate eye protection to prevent injuries from flying
objects. In those instances where our employees may be potentially exposed to flying objects, our safety program
calls for the mandatory use of eye protection that provides both front and side protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter, from the American Optometric Association, remarked (Ex. 3: 60, pg. 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While we recognize that mandatory side shields would afford additional protection in many instances, they may not
be practical in all situations. In addition, they may tend to reduce compliance with the use of the protector in cases
where peripheral hazard protection is not required. We would recommend that side shields be required 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 when the job evaluation indicates that a definite peripheral hazard exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA intended that proposed paragraph (a)(2) require side protection only when flying object hazards were present.
Therefore, the Agency has revised the provision concerning flying object hazards to state clearly that front and
side protection are required when there is a hazard from flying objects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that there are situations when side protection is unnecessary, and that employers should be allowed to
decide, based on a hazard assessment which complies with the requirements of 1910.132(d) of the final rule, if such
protection is necessary for their employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While one rulemaking participant (Ex. 3: 66) believed that side shields should be permanently attached, other rulemaking
participants stated that side protectors need not be permanent and that OSHA should permit detachable or clip-on
side protectors. For example, a commenter from Liberty Optical (Ex. 3: 63) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Clip-on side shields meet all the Z&hyph;87 performance standards that the permanent side shields meet and can be
worn when necessary. To be able to wear proper protection where appropriate and be realistic in its use, will make the
employee not look to side step it and, therefore, make it more effective and safer. If a blanket mandatory permanent
side shield regulation to cover all industrial environments is implemented, it will reverse all gains made in recent
years and will not accomplish its goal for a safer industrial environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees that side protection need not be permanent and that detachable side shields should be permitted as long
as they meet the criteria specified in this section of the final rule. Permitting detachable side shields will provide
employers the flexibility to use this kind of protection when necessary, based on conditions at the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has revised proposed paragraph (a)(1) accordingly, dividing the proposed paragraph into two provisions,
1910.133(a)(1) and (a)(2). Paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule states the general requirement to have each employee
use eye or face PPE when exposed to eye or face hazards, while paragraph (a)(2) states that eye PPE must provide side
protection, which may be detachable, when flying object hazards are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2) required that eye and face protection properly fit employees. Although the Agency did
not receive any comments concerning the proper fit of eye and face protection, OSHA did receive comments addressing
the proper fit of PPE, in general, and the need for properly fitting PPE for both male and female employees. This subject
was discussed previously under 1910.132 of this preamble, and OSHA has included a requirement in 1910.132 of the final
rule that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE properly fit employees. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a)(2) has not been included in the final rule, since it
would be redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposed in paragraph (a)(3) that protectors with tinted or variable tinted lenses not be worn when an employee
must pass from a brightly lighted area, such as outdoors, into a dimly lighted area, such as a warehouse. The Agency
proposed this requirement because it believed that the provision might reduce the likelihood that extreme lighting
changes would temporarily impair the vision of an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed requirement was the subject of Issue 3 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3412, February 1, 1990). The proposed
paragraph and Issue 3 generated a substantial amount of comment and testimony. While a few rulemaking participants
agreed with the proposed provision (e.g. Ex. 3: 28; Ex. 7: 2, 38), many opposed the provision and/or approach proposed
by OSHA (e.g. Ex. 3: 55, 61, 68; Ex. 7: 7, 8, 15, 23; Tr. 193: 4/3; Tr. 150&hyph;156: 4/4; Tr. 169: 4/4). Some of the rulemaking
participants stated that the proposed paragraph was too restrictive and vague. These rulemaking participants stated
that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (or designated safety officer) should decide when the use of this type of eyewear may create a hazard. This approach
is similar to that used in the ANSI standard for eye protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989; paragraph 6.5.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the American Optometric Association (Ex. 7: 11, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The use of photochromic lenses in industrial situations is dependent upon the visual demands of the task and the visual
needs of the wearer. The decision on the need for and use of photochromic lenses can best be made by evaluation of the
work place requirements by the employer in consultation with the employee's eye doctor. The development of a blanket
policy restricting the use of photochromic lenses for certain job tasks is unwarranted. The individual visual needs
and working conditions should dictate when photochromic lenses may be inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Optometric Association supports the ANSI Z87.1 position which provides employers the discretion to
decide when photochromic lenses may be utilized.

*&blank;*&blank;* the many beneficial features of photochromic lenses, particularly in safety glasses, justifies
their continued unfettered use in the workplace. My concern is that this proposed government intervention will likely
deter workers from using these photochromic lenses as safety devices and that increased numbers of eye injuries and
workplace accidents will ultimately result.

A hearing participant from Corning, Inc. (Tr. 111&hyph;114: 4/4) testified: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, photochromic lenses are used throughout the world and over 500 million lenses have been sold. Roughly, more
than 250 million pairs of eye glasses. Currently, more than 38 million photochromic lens blanks are sold each year.
Corning has therefore literally hundreds of millions of man years of experience with the use of photochromic eyeglasses
without any reported health of safety problem of the type to which the proposed regulation is addressed. I believe
that proposal 1910.133 (a)(3) is too vague and is in any event unnecessary and overly restrictive. The use of photochromic
lenses are subject to the ANSI Z87.1 standards including paragraph 6.5.2 and we believe this is the appropriate standard
for dealing with any possible need for a limitation on photochromic usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In daylight, outdoors, when the photochromic lenses darken to function as sunglasses they protect the eyes dark adaptation
process. It is well known that those who wear sunglasses in sunlight adapt to darker environments up to twice as fast
as those who do not. In the transient condition, that is, coming in from a brighter outdoor condition to a darker indoor
condition, wearing photochromic lenses can actually provide better and more comfortable vision under a broad variety
of work conditions. Visual function in the transition to and from bright light is superior when photochromic rather
than clear lenses are used.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the proposed requirement was too restrictive. The
Agency has determined that the employer, or the employer's representative (such as the company safety professional),
will be in the best position to determine when tinted or variable tint lenses should or should not be used, based on awareness
of workplace conditions. OSHA also notes that this approach is consistent with the current ANSI standard (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989-paragraph
6.5.2) which is (as discussed below) being incorporated by reference in the final rule. Accordingly, proposed paragraph
(a)(3) has not been retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(4) required that employees who wear prescription lenses while engaged in operations that
involve eye hazards shall wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in their design, or shall be protected
by eye protection that can be worn over prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the prescription or protective lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency did not receive any comments on this proposed provision and it is, therefore, contained in the final rule
as proposed. However, since this section has been reorganized, the provision has been redesignated as 1910.133(a)(3)
of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing 1910.133 (a)(4) states that ``every protector shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification
only of the manufacturer.'' OSHA had proposed to delete this provision because the Agency believed that compliance
did not add to or detract from the safety of the protector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a few commenters agreed with OSHA in principle (e.g. Ex. 3: 50, 92, 115), the vast majority of commenters stated
that the marking requirement should not be deleted (e.g. Ex. 3: 75, 88, 92, 114, 126). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (Ex. 3: 71, pg. 4) asserted: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing system of easily identifying the manufacturers of the components of eye PPE is embedded in the standard
to assure accountability and is accepted throughout the industry. It should be retained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since employees are permitted to provide their own eye protection and employers are held accountable to ensure that
employees are wearing the proper eye protection, these markings provide employers a ready way of checking for whether
or not employees are wearing the proper eye protection.

The identification markings are necessary in the event of a manufacturing defect or material defect, so that the purchaser
may receive an adjustment from the seller or manufacturer. Identification is also needed in case the manufacturer
makes a product recall.

In supporting the concept that OSHA should be consistent with the ANSI requirement for marking, a commenter from US
West, Inc. (Ex. 3: 85, pp. 2&hyph;3) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
US WEST, Inc. recommends that the identifying marking, i.e. manufacturers monogram and ``Z87'', continue to be required
(ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 8.10). US WEST, Inc. disagrees with OSHA's statement that``&sect;*&blank;*&blank;* marking
to identify the manufacturers of eye and face protection does not add or delete from the safety afforded by the protector.''
Lenses meeting ANSI Z87 are easily identified by the manufacturers monogram. ``Street'' or ``dress'' spectacles
not meeting ANSI Z87 are also easily identified by the absence of such markings. US WEST, Inc. has found non-Z87 replacement
prescription lenses placed in employees Z87 frames, reducing the employees degree of protection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above-discussed comments, OSHA included Issue 1 in the Hearing Notice, to elicit more information regarding
the utility of compliance with existing 1910.133(a)(4). The comments and testimony received (Ex. 7: 2, 13, 31; Tr.
55, 133, 156: 4/3; Tr. 68, 148, 225: 4/4) uniformly supported retaining the marking requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, one commenter from SIGNODE (Ex. 7: 6) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There is agreement that marking of eye and face protection ``does not add or detract from the safety afforded by the
protector'' however, the current etched lens marking provide the safety manager, management and supervision a means
of verifying that the worker, employee, contractor or visitor is, in fact, wearing proper safety eyewear, not street
wear.Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the requirement for marking of eye and face protectors
should be retained. OSHA agrees with commenters that the marking of eye and face protectors provides easy recognition
that the protectors meet specified criteria (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989); that marking will provide accountability,
and traceability in cases of product recall; and that marking requirements should be consistent with the ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989
standard, since this is the accepted and recognized practice throughout the industry. Accordingly, the requirement
for marking of eye and face protectors is being retained in 1910.133(a)(4) of the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(5) required that employees use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate
for the work being performed for protection from potentially injurious light radiation. OSHA also proposed a table
in this paragraph which contained a list of appropriate shade numbers for various operations. The Agency did not receive
any comments on this provision, and it is contained in the final rule with minor editorial changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 contained ``acceptable design'' requirements for eye and face protection. In
this provision, OSHA proposed that eye and face protection comply with the design requirements specified in ANSI
Z87.1&hyph;1989, or be of a design which could be demonstrated to be equally effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants supported the proposed adoption of the ANSI standard for eye and face protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989).
However, a few commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 101, 125) expressed concern that the Agency proposed to adopt only the ``design
requirements'' of ANSI Z87.1. These commenters asserted that OSHA should adopt by reference all of the ANSI standard,
not just the design requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that eye and face protective devices must meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This
requirement is stated explicitly in ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989, Section 3. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not
clearly express the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 in its entirety and is revising the proposed
rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 62, 75, 102, 128) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference the ``current''
edition of all of the applicable ANSI standards (i.e., the ANSI standards for eye and face protection, head protection,
and foot protection) rather than referencing a specific edition. These commenters stated that this approach would
prevent a situation where the OSHA standards would be outdated when the ANSI standards are revised in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that it would be improper for the Agency to reference consensus standards as suggested, because such action
would illegally subdelegate authority over the content of OSHA standards to the committees responsible for updating
the ANSI standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will accept eye and face protective devices as complying with this section if they are demonstrated to be
as effective as those meeting the specific ANSI standard referenced by the final rule. For example, the final rule
is incorporating by reference the 1989 edition of ANSI Z87.1 for eye and face protection. Eye and face protective devices
meeting a subsequent edition of the same ANSI standard would be acceptable to the Agency (and a de minimis violation
of the standard) if it could be demonstrated by the employer that they were as effective as those meeting the 1989 edition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, employers would need to establish either that there was no substantive difference between a subsequent
edition of Z87.1 and the 1989 edition, or that PPE which satisfied subsequently modified test criteria provided protection
equivalent to that provided by PPE which satisfied the 1989 edition. Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 has been revised
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in
accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been revised
so that paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule reflects that approval and provides the requisite information regarding
access to the text of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has also determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of eye and face PPE purchased
prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z87.1&hyph;1968) referenced
by existing 1910.133(a)(6). To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1)
of the final rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the subject of eye and face protection, Issue 5 of the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412) requested comments
and information concerning the use of contact lenses. Specifically, the Agency asked if it should expand its eye and
face requirements to cover contact lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 13, 15, 16) stated that no additional regulations were necessary for the use of contact
lenses. Other commenters (Ex. 7: 21, 26) believed that OSHA should address the issue of contact lenses in the final
rule, and should clarify if it is permissible to wear contact lenses with eye protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 107&hyph;D; Ex. 7: 5, 22) stated that wearing contact lenses with appropriate eye
protection does not present any additional hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA believes that contact lenses do not pose additional hazards to the wearer, and
has determined that additional regulation addressing the use of contact lenses is unnecessary. The Agency wants
to make it clear, however, that contact lenses are not eye protective devices. If eye hazards are present, appropriate
eye protection must be worn instead of, or in conjunction with, contact lenses.

1910.135 Head Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1910.135 set requirements for the use of protective helmets and set criteria for acceptable equipment designs.
Proposed paragraph (a) required employees to wear protective helmets (1) ``when working in areas where there is a
potential for injury to the head from falling or moving objects'' and (2) ``where they are near exposed electrical
conductors which could be contacted by the protective helmets.'' Proposed paragraph (b) referenced American National
Standard, ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, ``Protective Headwear for Industrial Workers-Requirements''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed language was based on existing 1910.132(a) and 1910.135 and on ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. Existing 1910.132(a)
requires that the PPE necessary to protect employees from workplace hazards be provided, used and maintained properly.
That standard specifically includes head protection under its coverage. Existing 1910.135 facilitates compliance
with existing 1910.132(a) regarding helmets worn for protection ``from falling and flying objects and from limited
electric shock and burn,'' by requiring that those helmets comply with the American National Standard Safety Requirements
for Industrial Head Protection, Z89.1&hyph;1969. ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 is the most recent edition of the pertinent
national consensus standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(a)(1), unlike existing 1910.135, explicitly required the use of protective helmets. The proposed
paragraph also made some editorial revisions to existing 1910.135. For example, the proposal replaced ``flying''
with ``moving'', because OSHA believed the term ``moving'' better described the means in which objects contact employees.
OSHA used the terms ``flying'' and ``moving'' in the existing and proposed rules, respectively, in conjunction with
the term ``falling'' to be consistent with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter (Ex. 7: 20) stated that OSHA should address lateral impact protection ``since there are substantial injuries
that occur from directions other than vertical impact*&blank;*&blank;*&sect;'' In the course of this rulemaking,
OSHA obtained a helmet (Ex. 46) capable of protecting employees against lateral as well as vertical impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NIOSH testified (Tr. 30: 4/3) that, while most blows to the head come from the back, front or side, ANSI
Z89.1 1986 addresses only protection for the top of the head. NIOSH further testified: ``Currently helmets are being
marketed that provide impact protection to most parts of the head. OSHA standards should encourage the use of these
more protective helmets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some rulemaking participants (Ex. 3: 84, 96) expressed concern regarding the use of the term ``moving'' in the proposed
paragraph. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 3: 84, pg. 4) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
API is opposed to the wording of this paragraph. The ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986 referenced in 1910.135(b) contains
helmet specifications ``to protect the heads of industrial workers from impact or penetration by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
falling objects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*'' OSHA must recognize that the ANSI standard does not provide design criteria for moving objects.
If OSHA intends this section to also cover helmets protecting against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
moving
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 objects, as proposed in 1910.135(a)(1), additional design criteria should be cited in 1910.135(b).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 1910.135 Head Protection, we find the requirement to provide head protection vague, and welcome additional
clarification from OSHA with regard to potential for injury to the head from moving objects. We are concerned compliance
personnel will interpret the requirement so broadly as to include any use of hoisting equipment. Although we can envision
an occasional situation where there may be a hazard, most operations using a hoist would present no significant hazard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter (Ex. 3: 40) suggested that OSHA revise proposed 1910.135(a)(1) so that the provision ``Mandates
that employers require their employees wear protective helmets when they are in an area where there is potential for
injury to the head from falling, moving, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
swinging, flying or airborne objects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' The commenter did not state why it believed the recommended language was needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 72, 79) stated that proposed 1910.135(a)(1) should also require employees to wear head protection
when working in confined spaces and commenters (Ex. 3: 79, 119) have stated that OSHA should require protection against
impacts with fixed objects.. For example, Centel (Ex. 3: 72) noted that injuries may result from contact with low hanging
structures and that Centel already requires its employees working in confined spaces to wear head protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (Ex. 3: 79) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe a statement should be added with provision for protection against impacts with fixed objects. We recommend
a sentence should be added that addresses this hazard. We also suggest that in areas that are confined or congested
and the employee is subject to impact with fixed objects, suitable protective helmets be worn. We recommend that bump
caps should not be used in an industrial environment because there are too many possibilities of head injuries that
could occur. We recommend maximum head protection at all times in this type of environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current ANSI standard, Z89.1&hyph;1986, addresses only protection ``from impact and penetration by falling
objects and from high-voltage electric shock and burn.'' The Agency has determined that it would be inappropriate
for 1910.135(a) to cover head protection that is not also covered by the ANSI standard referenced in 1910.135(b),
unless OSHA provides criteria for assessing compliance. The Agency has determined that it is not in a position to set
such criteria, so OSHA has deleted the term ``moving'' from 1910.135(a)(1) of the final rule and has not added the terms
suggested by commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that compliance with the ANSI criteria referenced through 1910.135(b) of the final rule will
enable employers to protect their employees from a large proportion of potential head hazards. Head protection not
covered by 1910.135 of the final rule, such as would be needed to protect employees from ``moving'' or ``fixed'' objects,
is covered by the general requirements of 1910.132, as revised. OSHA anticipates that employers whose hazard assessments
identify head hazards that are not abated through compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, will develop and implement
other measures as necessary, to protect their employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(a)(2) required that employees who are near exposed energized conductors which their heads could
contact must wear helmets designed for protection from electrical hazards. Two commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested
that OSHA revise the proposed provision by adding requirements for proper maintenance of head protection. In particular,
Public Service Electric and Gas Company (Ex. 3: 36) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) should also require: ``Protective
helmets shall be worn and cared for as recommended by the manufacturer. Protective helmets shall not be altered or
defaced which would take away the impact and/or dielectric integrity of the helmet.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that any employee protection which could result from compliance with the suggested language
on maintenance will already be attained through compliance with existing and proposed 1910.132. This section contains
requirements concerning defective and damaged equipment, 1910.132(e); and, training requirements pertaining
to the maintenance of PPE, 1910.132(f)(1)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Ex. 3: 81) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) was unclear, because it appeared ``to require
nonconductive helmets for electricians whenever they are ``near exposed electrical conductors'' even if there
is no reasonable probability of contact.'' The commenter suggested that OSHA revise the proposed language to require
the wearing of protective helmets ``WHEN they are near exposed electrical conductors which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
their heads could contact.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that the suggested language is consistent with the description of proposed paragraph (a)(2) in the
preamble to the proposed rule (54 FR 33836). OSHA agrees that clarification of the proposed paragraph is appropriate
and has revised the proposed paragraph accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(b) required that the design of protective helmets comply with the design requirements of ANSI
Z89.1&hyph;1986 or be of a design that provides equivalent protection. Existing 1910.135 references the requirements
and specifications established in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. As noted in the preamble to the NPRM (54 FR 33837), OSHA has
determined that, except as regards electrical insulation for Class B helmets, the 1969 and 1986 editions of ANSI Z89.1
set essentially the same requirements. The Agency also has determined that Class B helmets currently in use already
comply with the electrical insulation requirements of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also proposed to allow protective helmets which, while not designed to the specifications of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986,
were ``demonstrated to be equally effective''. The Agency believed that this performance-oriented approach would
encourage innovation and the use of improved equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter (Ex. 3: 119) stated that the proposed language allowing protective helmets of a design which has been demonstrated
to be equally effective ``is not well defined.'' In addition, the commenter questioned the availability of the means
and the personnel to determine if helmets not designed according to ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 were equally effective.
The commenter suggested that OSHA delete the language in question and require compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Ex. 7: 20, pg. 3), in discussing the proposed language ``demonstrated to be equally effective'',
inquired: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

OSHA believes that the performance criteria set out in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 7, indicate clearly how employers
or the Agency can determine if helmets that do not otherwise comply with the consensus standard are ``equally effective''.
OSHA also believes that the performance-oriented language of proposed paragraph (b) allows employers the appropriate
flexibility to address their particular safety needs. Another commenter (Ex. 3: 126) stated that ``protective helmets
should comply with the performance requirements as well as the design requirements of ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of evaluating these comments, OSHA noted that there are no provisions specifically designated as ``design
requirements'' in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969 or ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. The 1986 edition, in particular, sets scope and
purpose provisions; definitions; types and classes provisions; materials provisions; physical requirements;
performance requirements; and test methods for protective helmets. The preamble discussion of proposed paragraph
(b) (54 FR 33836&hyph;33837) referenced the physical requirements (e.g., the maximum weight), the performance
requirements (e.g., impact resistance, penetration protection, flammability, water absorption resistance and
electrical insulation) and the test methods (e.g., ``stringent'' test methods for testing of ``Class B'' helmets
against high-voltage) of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees, and intends, that head PPE meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This requirement
is stated explicitly in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 2. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not clearly express
the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 in its entirety and is revising the proposed provision accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in
accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised
to reflect that approval and to provide the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of head PPE purchased prior
to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z89.1&hyph;1969) referenced
by existing 1910.135. To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) of the final
rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal (54 FR 33837), OSHA solicited comments and information concerning bump caps, head protection that
was not addressed in existing or proposed 1910.135 and that would not satisfy the criteria of Z89.1&hyph;1986. In
particular, the Agency requested information with respect to the appropriateness of addressing this type of head
protection in the final rule. OSHA also solicited input regarding the need for regulation of bump caps in Issue 5 of
the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412). Some rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 40, 58) have suggested that OSHA establish
requirements for bump caps. For example, Sandia National Laboratories (Ex. 3: 58) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Currently, there are no Federal standards, regulations, or guidance of any kind with which industry can make proper
and adequate decisions on the use of bump caps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bump caps are not new to the work place. Where the risk of head injury has been determined to be of low probability or result
in minor contusions, scraps or cuts, bump caps have been provided. The old adage that ``something is better than nothing''
tends to prevail when industry is forced to make an educated guess. Is the adage true in the case of bump caps? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary there is a need for Federal time and money to be spent on discovering the pro's and con's associated with bump
caps and developing corresponding guidance for their use in the work place.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, Kerr-McGee Corporation (Ex. 3: 119, pg. 3) stated : 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Kerr-McGee's use of bump caps is limited to areas where there is no potential for injury to the head from electrical
contact or from falling or moving objects, but where a hazard may exist due to striking one's head against fixed, low-clearance
objects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kerr-McGee is not aware of any voluntary or consensus standards covering bump caps. If the degree of protection afforded
by currently-produced bump caps is determined by scientific studies to be inadequate for their intended use as stated
on the products, then OSHA should request ANSI to develop a standard. Otherwise, we do not see the need for additional
specifications or standards.

requirements for bump caps to the final rule because they believe that if head protection is needed, then it would be
safer to require head protection meeting ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. For example, a commenter from the American Trucking
Association (Ex. 3: 64, pg. 5) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For the trucking industry in general, bump caps are not practical. Although they are used in some operations for select
job tasks, the motor carrier industry has found little benefit in reducing minor head injuries through their use.
In fact, safety personnel from a cross section of the nation's motor carriers recently explained that bump caps can
be more of a hinderance than a help; they frequently fall off, and in some instances, they can cause vision obstructions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* Union Carbide would not support a provision pertaining to ``bump caps''. Where there is sufficient

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
We believe that the use of ``bump caps'' has no place in a company-sponsored safety program and therefore do not favor

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA has concluded, based on review of the rulemaking record, that the available data do not support regulatory action
regarding bump caps. Therefore, the Agency will neither restrict the use of bump caps nor set criteria for such use.
OSHA will evaluate an employer's choice of head protection based on the e hazards to which employees may be exposed.
Therefore, the employer's compliance with the requirement for a hazard assessment, in 1910.132(d), is of critical
importance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) of this section required employers to ensure that employees wear protective footwear when
working in areas where there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling and rolling objects, or objects piercing the
sole. This proposed provision received a large amount of support from rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59,
64, 67). Many of the rulemaking participants agreed with referencing the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standard for personal protection, ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, ``Protective Footwear,'' particularly since this
standard, unlike the superseded 1967 edition, sets criteria for women's footwear and for puncture resistance. However,
two commenters were concerned as to when this protection would be required. A commenter from the American Trucking
Association (ATA) stated (Ex. 3: 64, pp. 4&hyph;5): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* in some operations drivers may be exposed to falling or rolling freight hazards, or other hazards
presented by nails or other sharp objects. In these cases, safety shoes, non-penetrable soles, or some other type
of protective footwear are appropriate. On the other hand, there are thousands of drivers that never handle freight
or come into exposure with falling or rolling freight, sharp objects, or any other number of hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The need to require the equipment must be determined on a case by case basis--taking into account
the specific operations, and the specific tasks and hazards of the various job functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter, from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), expressed a similar concern with respect to when
foot protection is required (Ex. 3: 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specialty shoes such as ``electrical hazard'' footwear or ``conductive'' shoes have special requirements that
would not permit metal insoles to prevent the puncture. If this requirement is upheld, the current design standards
and performance criteria for electrical hazard shoes could not be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA notes that these concerns are addressed by 1910.132(d), as proposed and as promulgated. That provision requires
the employer to perform a hazard assessment. From the hazard assessment, the employer can determine what PPE is needed.
As to the example presented by the ATA, if it is determined through an appropriate hazard assessment that an employee
is not exposed to foot hazards, the employer would not have to provide this type of protection. As discussed above,
the hazard assessment provision allows employers the flexibility to choose the PPE that is appropriate for a particular
workplace situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ALCOA comment, OSHA notes that if it is determined through a hazard assessment that electrical workers
are not exposed to the hazard of sharp objects puncturing the soles of shoes (which would be the case in many instances),
the protective footwear would not have to provide this type of protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, if it is determined through a hazard assessment that employees are exposed both to electrical and
puncture hazards, the employer would be required to ensure that employees wear shoes which protect the employees
from both hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the 1983 and 1991 editions of ANSI Z41 set criteria for protection of feet from electrical hazards. While proposed
1910.136(b) required that footwear be designed to either comply with Z41&hyph;1983 or be demonstrated to provide
equivalent protection, proposed 1910.136(a) did not explicitly require that employees wear foot protection against
electrical hazards. The Agency had intended proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) to be consistent and to reflect the 1983
edition of ANSI Z41. While employers are already required to protect employees from electrical hazards under existing
1910.132, OSHA believes that guidance regarding foot protection against electrical hazards will be clearer and
more useful if it appears in 1910.136. OSHA has revised proposed 1910.136(a) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (b) of 1910.136, OSHA proposed that the design of protective footwear comply with the requirements of
ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, or be of a design which has been demonstrated to be equally effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59, 67, 72, 105, 118, 123) supported the adoption of the ANSI standard for
foot protection (ANSI Z41). Further, several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 67, 82, 84) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference
the ``updated'' or ``current'' edition of ANSI Z41. For example, Footwear Industries of America (FIA) (Ex. 3: 67,
pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FIA therefore agrees with OSHA's proposal to update its personal protective equipment standard for foot protection
to comply with the improvements made in the ANSI standard. The Agency should note, however, that the 1983 version of
the ANSI Z41 standard may soon be replaced by an updated set of industry standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIA suggests that OSHA may wish to await the 1990 version of ANSI Z41 rather than to incorporate a seven-year old, nearly
outdated standard into 29 C.F.R. 1910.136.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency notes that the 1991 edition of the ANSI standard for foot protection has, in fact, replaced the 1983 edition
of ANSI Z41 referenced by OSHA in proposed 1910.136(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to reference the current 1991 edition of ANSI Z41 in 1910.136(b) of the final
rule because that edition imposes essentially the same requirements as the 1983 edition, except that the 1991 edition
provides more specific performance requirements for resistance to compressive forces and standardizes the puncture
resistance testing method. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent ANSI standards and of the protective
footwear currently available, that compliance with the referenced requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 will not
result in disallowing foot protection that would have complied with the requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to provide explicitly for the continued use of foot
PPE purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (ANSI Z41.1&hyph;1967)
referenced by existing 1910.136. Therefore, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1)
of the final rule, and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter from the Tennessee Valley Authority (Ex. 3: 79) observed that OSHA proposed to incorporate only the design
requirements of the referenced ANSI standards and not the selection requirements, guidelines, and other general
information contained in the documents. As explained above in the preamble, OSHA acknowledges that the proposal
did not clearly express the Agency's intent to reference the ANSI standards in their entirety and is revising proposed
paragraph (b) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of the pertinent ANSI standards has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register,
in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been
revised so that paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule reflect that approval and provide the requisite information
regarding access to the text of those ANSI standards.

1910.138 Hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 5 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414), requested testimony, comments and information regarding the need for regulation
of additional types of PPE. Specifically, the Agency stated that it was considering the appropriateness of promulgating
requirements for hand protection (gloves) and skin protection (chemical protective clothing). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's concern with respect to hand protection and chemical protective clothing arose from information contained
in the record (e.g. Ex. 6: 2, 3, 4, 5), which indicates that a large number of employee injuries are occurring due to the
lack of adequate protection from hand and skin hazards. Additionally, neither OSHA or ANSI currently have criteria
for hand protection nor for chemical protective clothing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While OSHA received some information pertaining to chemical protective clothing, most of the rulemaking participants
who addressed Issue 5 focused their remarks on gloves. Those rulemaking participants suggested that OSHA provide
performance criteria and test methods for gloves and provide better guidance for the selection of gloves. They stated
that in many instances gloves are not being worn, and when gloves are worn, they are often the wrong type of glove for
the application involved (e.g. Ex. 3: 114; Ex. 7: 33, 38, 42; Ex. 53; Tr. 213&hyph;236: 4/3; Tr. 13&hyph;20: 4/4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, a commenter from the United Steelworkers of America (Ex. 3: 114, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Protective clothing and gloves: OSHA should also set standards for these items since so many gloves do not work with
some chemicals and last longer with other chemicals.

Boeing supports the position that additional guidelines related to body and hand protection are necessary in 1910.132.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I go into a lot of plants throughout the country and site visits and the first thing I do is I look at the OSHA 200 log. I see
many cases of occupational dermatitis. My first assumption was these people are not wearing gloves. After further
investigation once I'm in that facility, I find out that the workers are wearing gloves, but they're wearing the wrong
glove for the application involved. So, this really needs to be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency also received some useful information about the various types of gloves and types of hazards for which they
should be used; the composition of the various types of gloves; and, other helpful information (Ex. 3: 27). There were
also some informative studies submitted to the record concerning the hand and skin hazards posed by certain chemicals
(Ex. 42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful evaluation of the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the high incidence of hand injuries, together
with evidence that hand protection either is not being worn by employees or is being worn for the wrong type of hazards,
warrants the inclusion of more detailed requirements for selection and wearing of hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a new section, 1910.138, is being added to the final rule to address hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) requires that employers select, and that employees use, appropriate hand protection. In addition,
paragraph (a) identifies some of the types of hazards for which hand protection must be worn by employees. These include
hand hazards and potential hand hazards from skin absorption of harmful substances; severe cuts or lacerations;
severe abrasions; punctures; chemical burns; thermal burns; and harmful temperature extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) addresses the selection of the appropriate type of hand protection for the hazard or potential hazard
that is present at the workplace. The purpose of this provision is to assure that employees are using the appropriate
type of gloves for the tasks to be performed. For example, foundry workers generally must wear gloves that provide
thermal protection, while meat cutters must wear gloves that protect against cuts. While the selection of the appropriate
type of glove for a certain task or hazard may seem to be obvious, the rulemaking record indicates that many hand injuries
have occurred because the wrong type of glove was used for a certain task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Therefore, OSHA has determined that employers need more explicit guidance in determining what hand protection their
employees need. The Agency anticipates that compliance with this provision will assure that employees use the appropriate
type of hand protection for the assigned tasks and the identified hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has also added information to Appendix B of the final rule regarding the selection of appropriate hand protection.

Third party certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM (54 FR 33835), OSHA solicited comments on whether or not the Agency should require third party certification
of PPE. OSHA indicated that it would consider promulgating such a provision to ensure that PPE meets OSHA standards.
In addition, Issue 2 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3413) solicited testimony, with supporting information, regarding
the extent to which third party certification of PPE required by Subpart I would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third party certification issue generated more response than any other subject covered by this rulemaking. Many
of the participants in this rulemaking supported third party certification (e.g. Ex. 3: 3, 16, 27, 37, 83, 90, 92, 98,
114, 120, 123; Ex. 7: 3, 18, 20; Tr. 55: 4/3; Tr. 92&hyph;97: 4/3; Tr. 6&hyph;7: 4/4; Ex. 49). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In supporting third party certification, a commenter from MSA (Ex. 3: 18) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide user companies with assurances that personal protective equipment meets the appropriate standards,
we think it would be highly desirable for OSHA to require third-party certification of PPE. We think a program such
as the one offered by the Safety Equipment Institute that provides independent testing and quality assurance audits
is extremely valuable and adds minimum cost to safety equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Our experience supports the use of third-party certification as positive assurance that the products covered by
a program do, in fact, meet the standards to which they are tested, and that follow-up inspections verify that they
continue to meet the requirements. Third-party certification programs offer the user of personal protective equipment
a positive pledge that the product has been designed and manufactured to provide the protection needed. It further
simplifies the selection process by way of readily available lists of complying products and recognizable labels
and marks on them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although we are not prepared to give detailed estimates of costs of third-party certification for the various products,
the fees are not burdensome, even on small businesses. The equipment must be tested, whether it is in a program or not;
therefore, that cost is present in either case. The administration of a simple yet effective program with follow-up
factory inspection would probably not exceed $1,500&hyph;2,000 per year per plant based on some similar programs
we operate. Obviously, there are many types of programs, and the fees will vary dependent on the level of services rendered.

SEI's program of periodic quality assurance audits and product testing is now widely accepted by industry and government.
Over two hundred organizations and federal agencies require the SEI certification as a condition of procurement
for PPE. SEI combines both compliance testing of product and periodic quality assurance audits of manufacturers'
production facilities. These activities are performed under SEI direction by independent third parties to maintain
an objective program.

We feel that third party certification, akin to that currently required for respiratory protection, should be mandated
by the proposed rule. Such certification would guarantee that equipment was thoroughly tested prior to its being
relied on to provide safety for workers who may daily, or even occasionally, encounter hazardous situations.

A hearing participant from the Industrial Safety

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether the third party certification is performed by private or governmental entity, ISEA supports its use as a means
of confirming the quality of products made for the protection of workers. In the absence of government standards and
certification of compliance, ISEA endorses third party certification of compliance with ANSI standard Z87.1, 1989,
and Z89.1, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the additional cost involved for manufacturers of personal protective equipment to obtain certification
is minimal, as is reflected by the number of eye and face protection devices and industrial helmets which are already
certified by the Safety Equipment Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third party certification costs are averaged over the volume of units sold, and we believe end up as an insignificant
cost increase.

Other rulemaking participants expressed concerns with the concept of third party certification. One concern expressed
by several rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 79, 87, 105) was the belief that OSHA envisioned requiring employers,
rather than manufacturers of the PPE, to obtain the third party certification. That was not the Agency's intent. OSHA
notes that the manufacturer of the PPE, not the purchaser/user, is, in general, the party who is in the appropriate
position to have products tested and evaluated. OSHA's intention regarding the duty of employers was to reaffirm
the employer's responsibility to purchase and have employees use only PPE that would meet the requirements of the
pertinent standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants also expressed concern that it would be very difficult to have third party certification
of prescription safety eyewear (e.g. Ex. 3: 60, 71, 93, 115; Ex. 7: 11, 34; Tr. 184&hyph;191: 4/3; Tr. 206: 4/4; Ex. 50).
They asserted that third party certification would not be practical since the eyecare providers and prescription
laboratories, generally small businesses, who produce prescription eyewear would be unable to bear the burden of
third party certification. They also stated that each pair of prescription glasses is unique to the individual for
whom it was prescribed. Those rulemaking participants explained that lenses are tested by the manufacturer to meet
ANSI standards, and frames are tested to meet ANSI standards by the frame manufacturers. Those participants also
expressed the belief that this testing meets the intent of third party certification. OSHA notes that the assurance
provided by such procedures may be even better than that obtained through third party certification because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 lens and frame is tested, rather than the representative sample of eyewear that would be tested through a third party
certification program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (OLA), stated (Ex. 3: 71, pp.1&hyph;2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the position of OLA that third-party certification of devices utilizing lenses made to individual prescription
(Rx) is not feasible, and in fact would not guarantee the safety-level provided by the present system as prescribed
by Z87. This is so because third-party certification of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not be practicable, whereas under the present system 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
prescription lenses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 are subject to a rigorous test and the fabricator of each lens certifies, by its trademark, that the lens meets the standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore submitted that the existing system of separate testing of the frame and lenses of spectacles containing
prescription lenses meets OSHA's objectives and is practical. Further testing of the completed device after the
lenses are inserted would not be feasible. While the test may not cause a device failure, it may damage the lenses and
weaken the frame.

We do not believe that this [third party testing of prescription eyewear] is practical. Most industrial eyewear today
[is] prescribed. *&blank;*&blank;* each prescription pair of glasses is unique to the individual for which it was
prescribed and made. The common denominator is that prescription eyewear lenses are 100% tested to pass the industrial
eyewear requirements for primary protection, i.e., impact resistance. Further, frames are tested and marked by
the frame manufacturer to meet the requirements.

Other rulemaking participants opposed third party certification of PPE (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 68, 99; Ex. 7: 1, 8, 39). For
instance, the belief was expressed (Ex. 3: 119) that the present voluntary system is adequate, particularly in light
of widespread concerns regarding product liability. In general, those opposed to third party certification believed
it would add cost, without adding any appreciable safety benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the American Gas Association (Ex. 3: 46, pg. 13) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA not to adopt such a requirement. Such certification would increase unnecessarily the incremental cost
of compliance while providing few, if any, benefits. Manufacturers who claim they are in compliance with the ANSI
standard could be subject to liability in cases where products fail to meet that standard. The cost of third party compliance
would be borne by the industry when the risk of liability should be sufficient to ensure compliance.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Third party certification of personal protective equipment by employers would be both costly to the manufacturer
and, subsequently, the employer. Additionally, it is not clear in the proposal as to how this requirement would enhance
the safety of the workforce. It would place an additional administrative and financial burden on both manufacturers
and employers, which does not seem to be justified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
MVMA strongly objects to the proposal of requiring third party certification for personal protective equipment.
We believe that personal protective equipment which meets the requirements of various safety standards such as ANSI
and the certification programs conducted by the Safety Equipment Institute are adequate to provide the assurance
that the PPE will meet the performance specifications necessary to protect an employee. To require a third party certification
will be redundant, costly and will not enhance the safety or performance of PPE.

In opposing third party certification, a commenter from Monsanto (Ex. 7: 16) said:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e question whether third party certification will add any benefits in terms of protection for employees. It will
certainly add to the cost of such equipment. We believe that the manufacturers' written statement that their equipment
meets the requirements of the appropriate ANSI standard should be sufficient. Our perception is that this arrangement
has worked well over the years and we see no benefit in changing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully considered this issue and, after a thorough evaluation of all of the information contained in the
record, has concluded for several reasons, that it would not be appropriate to require third party certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, while OSHA has recognized that third party certification of PPE can increase confidence in and use of PPE, a
requirement for such third party certification will not add to the inherent safety of the PPE tested and certified.
Also, given the extent to which the PPE industry has already voluntarily adopted third party certification, the Agency
believes that any benefit resulting from the addition of such a requirement would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, revised subpart I provides other means to determine if PPE meets the pertinent standard. In particular,
compliance with revised subpart I's performance-oriented requirements for hazard assessment, PPE selection,
and training will result in appropriate selection, use and maintenance of PPE by affected employees. For example,
the Agency expects that the training required in new 1910.132(f) will increase affected employee confidence in the
assigned PPE and, as a consequence, increase the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA believes, given the limited benefit expected from third party certification, that it would be unreasonable
to require that employers procure only PPE that has third party certification. Such a requirement would impose unnecessary
burdens on PPE manufacturers who can establish by other means that their products comply with the pertinent OSHA standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency believes that allocating the resources needed to implement and enforce a requirement for
third party certification would unreasonably detract from OSHA's ability to enforce the other provisions of revised
subpart I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also adding non-mandatory appendices A and B to provide additional guidance to employers and employees
with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards.

IV. Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Assessment of Revisions to Subpart I, Personal
Protective Equipment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1971, OSHA adopted its current standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) from national consensus standards
under section 6(a) of the OSH Act. Since then, advances in PPE technology have resulted in greater occupational protection
in workplaces where equipment innovations have been adopted. In this final rule, OSHA promulgates a nationwide standard
for PPE that reflects these improved means of hazard prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires that a Regulatory Impact Analysis be prepared for any ``significant
regulatory action''. A ``significant'' rule would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) requires an analysis of whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Finally, section 6(f) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act provides
that, where a party has challenged the validity of an OSHA standard in the Court of Appeals, the determinations of OSHA
(such as findings regarding the nature and severity of workplace hazards and the feasibility of identified abatement
measures) shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA determined, based on the Agency's Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1] and its review of the rulemaking
record, that the final rule for General Industry PPE is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of
review under Executive Order 12866. However, in order to satisfy the various statutory requirements placed upon
the Agency and to further explain why OSHA has classified this regulatory action as ``non-significant'' for Executive
Order 12866 purposes, OSHA presents this Final Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Impact
Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry Profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a report prepared by Eastern Research Group under contract to the Department of Labor [2], OSHA has determined
that the hazards addressed by the personal protective equipment standard are present in varying degrees in virtually
all workplaces covered by the OSHA General Industry standards (29 CFR 1910). The extent of the rule's impact will vary
by industry depending on the hazards, the types of occupational activity and current practices regarding PPE use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many types of PPE have been in widespread use in industry for many years. However, until recently very little statistical
data existed to determine the number of employees who either are using PPE or who should be wearing PPE by virtue of the
hazards to which they are exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's inspection data document that approximately 3.5 percent of all planned safety inspections result in citations
under the existing PPE standards. The inspection data identifies the standard industrial classification (SIC)
of the establishment, size of plant workforce, union status, and information related to the inspection itself; less
frequently reported are data on degree of hazard present in workplaces, the number of workers exposed to the hazard,
or the type of PPE required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA examined injury statistics for affected industry sectors.
Among the accident databases searched by OSHA were Work Injury Reports (WIR) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS). These reports examine cases where a worker was injured and provide evidence that many workers are not wearing
adequate personal protective equipment. Based on the BLS data, relatively few firms with serious recordable injury
cases have performed a formal assessment of the potential hazards in their workplace. In addition, little training
was offered to workers regarding the importance of using protective equipment in these firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain accurate information on the need for personal protective equipment and the extent to which that need is being
met, OSHA conducted a national survey in 1989 [3,4,5]. The survey sampled 5,361 establishments, representing 1.1
million establishments in 61 SIC groups. The survey identified the hazards related to industrial processes and the
types of PPE required when working in or near these processes. The survey solicited information on PPE practices and
safety procedures and assessed whether engineering controls such as protective guards or overhead nets were in place.
Answers to survey questions were used to evaluate the appropriateness of PPE use. Survey questions also addressed
PPE training and hazard assessment. (See the background document and appendices in this docket for more detailed
information on the survey and supporting data related to this analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 shows the major industry groups covered by the PPE standard, the total number of affected establishments,
total affected employment, number of production employees and number of employees exposed to PPE-related hazards.
Of the 16.9 million production workers, the survey identified 11.7 million exposed workers within 1.1 million establishments
who should be wearing some form of PPE. These numbers are lower than was indicated in the PRIA, due to a refinement in
the analysis regarding affected population. Occupational categories identified by OSHA as having a significant
degree of required PPE use include craft, operating, maintenance and material handling employees. These categories
encompass most production employees and are most likely to be affected by this standard. However, as noted in the PRIA
[1, p. II&hyph;2&hyph;4], OSHA has previously estimated over a million other workers may also be exposed to hazards
requiring PPE use in the rest of general industry

As was indicated in the PRIA, while all general industry workers are potentially affected by these standards, exposed
workers are heavily concentrated in certain occupations and in certain industries. Building upon information provided
for the PRIA and comments to the record, this final analysis focuses on those groups of workers and industries judged
to have a heavy concentration of PPE use. In this analysis population at risk was determined by survey results indicating
a hazard that required the use of PPE. The PRIA had used the term ``population at risk'' to refer to all workers in two
``production worker'' job categories in general industry [1, p. II&hyph;1&hyph;5]. It should be noted that this
analysis in no way implies that other workers may not be exposed to hazards preventable by PPE, but simply that the great
majority are found in certain specific job categories and industries.

From survey results OSHA developed a profile of the affected population by exposed bodily area (anatomical part),
summarized in Table 2. As the table shows, almost 8.8 million workers are exposed to foot injury, while the potential
for hand injury exists for 4.7 million workers. Other anatomical parts covered by this rule are eyes (2.8 million workers
at risk), head (1.9 million workers) and face (381,000 workers).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing and revised standards for subpart I require personal protective equipment wherever necessary by reason
of the hazards of processes, environment or worker activity. New 1910.132(d) requires workplace hazard assessment
and new 1910.132(f) requires employee training in the use of PPE. The revised standards for eye and face protection,
protective headwear and foot protection update, prospectively, references to pertinent consensus standards.
OSHA expects that employers will be able to comply with the new and revised requirements without difficulty, because
the means of compliance are readily available and because the final rule ``grandfathers'' equipment that complies
with the existing standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA anticipates that the new requirements for hazard assessment, prohibition of defective and damaged equipment,
and employee training can be implemented with available technical personnel and other resources. OSHA's survey
probed the extent to which firms have already adopted the elements of a PPE program. Comments in the record were also
evaluated in order to establish current industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of evidence in the record, including results from the OSHA PPE survey, OSHA has determined that the final
PPE standard is both technologically and economically feasible.

Costs of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA estimated compliance costs using data on current practices and exposed population from the PPE survey. Aggregating
costs across industry sectors, OSHA estimates a total annual compliance cost of new provisions in the revised rule
will result in a cost of $52.4 million. Total compliance costs by industry sector are presented in Table 3.

OSHA's survey identified 433,149 establishments which need to take steps to come into compliance with the new provisions
for hazard assessment. (Of 825,265 affected establishments, approximately 47 percent already had a hazard assessment
program in place.) The cost to conduct hazard assessments was estimated to be $15.9 million per year, assuming a reassessment
is conducted once every five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new provision for PPE training would affect approximately 10.8 million employees estimated in need of PPE training,
at an annual cost of $36.5 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates for the cost of providing PPE training differ from those in Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis due
to comments received and results from OSHA's PPE survey. This information indicated that the problem of PPE non-usage
is considerably more widespread than originally estimated. Correspondingly, this indicated that the population
requiring PPE training was larger than originally estimated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the risk of fatality and injury to workers is unacceptably high among sectors affected by the revised
personal protective equipment standard. The revised PPE standard is designed to enhance compliance with existing
requirements and ensure future compliance related to a heightened level of hazard awareness and training. These
changes to the standard should help to eliminate or reduce accidents within industries subject to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard has performance-oriented provisions addressing eye, face, hand, head and foot hazards that allow employers
to adopt the most up-to-date PPE for use in their establishment. The flexibility to substitute new materials and technologies
should produce more comfortable and protective PPE. An increase in worker acceptance and use of PPE should translate
into additional benefits. OSHA's expectation is that increased use of better equipment will prevent or lessen the
severity of many incidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to BLS statistics in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1989
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [6], there were a total of 1.6 million lost-workday cases and 1.8 million non-lost-workday cases during the survey
year. Eastern Research Group [7] analyzed survey-related data, which were used to extract the number of these injuries
that were related to use (or nonuse) of PPE. In turn, BLS Work Injury Reports were analyzed to estimate what portion
of those injuries related to inconsistent or inappropriate use of PPE, or lack of hazard identification. Injuries
prevented in significantly affected industry sectors are shown in Table 4. Since injuries will be prevented in some
other industry sectors as well, total estimates are conservative.

OSHA estimates that 712,000 lost workdays&sect;
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and 65,000 non-lost workday cases will be realized from compliance with requirements for employee training and workplace
hazard assessment. These benefits will be gained through selection of more appropriate PPE, increased awareness
of hazards and improved consistency in use. These benefit estimates exceed those of the PRIA because OSHA has determined
that current compliance with the PPE standards is poorer than was estimated in the PRIA. In addition, OSHA believes
these requirements will enhance compliance with existing requirements, thereby preventing more injuries; however,
the extent of these benefits are difficult to quantify.

Recent research by Arthur Oleinick identifies a possible underestimation of lost workdays when reference periods
are bounded by calendar years, as in the BLS survey. For elaboration of this point, see Oleinick [8].

OSHA also estimated the number of fatalities associated with the absence of personal protective equipment. From
an analysis of BLS, NIOSH and OSHA accident data, OSHA estimates that 125 fatal head injuries occur annually. While
most fatal head injuries are the result of crushing injuries, falls, explosions and other traumatic events beyond
the scope of this standard, some are preventable with the use of head protection. Based on a review of OSHA accident
abstracts and an understanding of the rule's scope and effectiveness, OSHA estimates that 4 head injury fatality
cases are preventable each year through compliance with the new provisions of the standard.

Cost Savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon these estimated reduction in injuries, OSHA estimates that society will reap substantial economic benefits
from prevented injuries. Lost work time injuries can be particularly expensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPE is uniquely effective in preventing eye injuries, for example, which can be severely debilitating. Dr. Leonard
Parver [9, pp. 28&hyph;29] of Georgetown University's ophthalmology department elaborated on this cost to employers:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These injuries tend to be very devastating. They have severe impact on the patient in terms of vision, and the costs
are phenomenal. We estimate the costs of hospitalizing these patients at $250 million per year. That's just for the
hospital stay; that doesn't include lost work days and compensation costs. This is a very significant problem, and
very, very preventable. We're not talking about reinventing the wheel here. We have the means of doing this. We have
adequate eye protective gear. It's a matter of educating the workforce that this is necessary.

While employers typically bear only a fraction of the costs related to injuries, these costs can be substantial. Employers
specifically will benefit from reduced lost production time, administrative time spent preparing insurance claims
and accident reports and replacing injured workers. Based on a 1981 study by Levitt and coworkers [10], OSHA estimates
the cost to employers from the average lost worktime injury is at least $4000
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
. This cost includes:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Levitt's wage rates were adjusted to reflect current wage conditions in general industry [11]. In light of the National
Safety Council estimates presented later in this document, given the debilitating severity of many PPE accidents
(eye, head), and the surge in workers compensation costs in recent years, an estimate of $4000 per injury is likely
to be conservative.

Other nonquantifiable costs associated with accidents, such as increased anxiety among non-injured workers, the
loss of employee goodwill towards the employer, and the impact on public perception of a company and its products were
not considered in the Levitt study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Levitt study and the estimated 37,924 lost workdays prevented, OSHA estimates that the rule will save
firms over $150 million annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as noted above, the cost of workplace injuries is typically borne primarily by employees themselves. The
National Safety Council recently calculated the societal cost per lost worktime injury at $27,000 [7,p. 35], by factoring
in long-term wage losses, medical expenses, administrative expenses and miscellaneous employer costs. Applying
this figure to OSHA's estimate of 37,924 lost workday injuries prevented annually, revisions to this rule should
save society (employees, employers and third parties) over $1 billion annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates of the economic benefits of the rule may be conservative, since the benefits analysis focuses on injuries
prevented, not reduced severity of injuries. To the extent the rule results in nonlost workday injuries, as opposed
to disabling lost workday injuries, the economic benefits may be greater yet. In sum, OSHA estimates the rule will
save society over $1 billion annually, dwarfing the initial $52 million investment. Employers themselves should
save over $150 million through full compliance with revisions to the PPE standard, approximately three times the
estimated cost of compliance.

Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA analyzed the potential economic impact of the revised PPE standard and has determined that none of the major industry
groups subject to the standard would experience a significant economic burden as a result of compliance, even before
cost savings to employers are factored in. Table 5 presents average compliance cost, revenue, profit, and economic
impacts of the standard for establishments in affected industry groups. If all of the compliance costs are passed
through to the consumer, OSHA estimates that the average price increase would be negligible, less than 0.001 percent,
calculated as the ratio of total compliance cost to industry sales. The maximum price increase in any industry would
be less than 0.005 percent. Given the minuscule price increases necessary to cover these safety investments, employers
should be able to pass along compliance costs to their customers. However, even if all costs were absorbed by the affected
firms, the average reduction in profits would be approximately 0.01 percent, the largest being 0.06 percent. OSHA,
therefore, does not expect the revised standard to have a significant economic impact on affected firms or industries

In the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA analyzed the entire spectrum of affected industries, and
had determined no significant economic impact would result on establishments on any industry, with substantially
less impact in those establishments without heavy PPE use. This determination was reached even though the PRIA included
costs not directly attributable to the proposal, resulting in a total cost estimate which was nearly twice the cost
estimated in this final analysis. Accordingly, OSHA reaffirms that establishments in those industries will incur
minimal economic impact.

), OSHA also analyzed the economic impact on small establishments (19 or fewer employees), looking particularly
for signs that the rule would pose excessive burdens per employee, relative to impacts faced by larger entities. OSHA
has determined that, in relation to compliance with the standard, equipment purchases and labor utilization will
to a great extent depend positively on size of workforce; smaller firms are not expected to incur relatively higher
costs per worker. As shown in Table 6, OSHA estimates that the average price impact for small establishments will be
0.002 percent, while profit impacts will not exceed 0.04 percent under the assumption that all compliance costs are
absorbed by firms. These impacts are judged to be relatively minor; therefore, the PPE standard is economically feasible
for small establishments.

The revisions to the PPE standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500
through 1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined
that the new PPE standard will have no significant environmental impact.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has described the hazards that require the use of PPE and the measures required to protect affected employees
from those hazards in Section I,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, above. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to
explain the legal basis for its determination that the revised PPE standard, as promulgated, is reasonably necessary
to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational safety and health standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``[e]ach employer
shall comply with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational safety and health standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  652(8)) provides that ``the
term 'occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use
of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide
safe or healthful employment and places of employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grain &amp; Feed Ass'n v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building &amp; Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought clarification
of the agency's view of the scope of its expertise and authority. In light of those decisions, the preamble to this safety
standard states OSHA's views regarding the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and explains why the Agency
is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) the proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Congress concluded that OSHA regulations are necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that
employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy *&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe *&blank;*&blank;* working conditions [29 U.S.C.  651(b)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C.  655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C.  651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe *&blank;*&blank;* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees
employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C.  654(a)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs
when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety
as a cost of doing business*&blank;*&blank;*. Indeed, Congress thought that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

[T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses*&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers
-- particularly smaller ones -- simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively,
unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. As construed by the courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act sets clear and reasonable limits for agency rulemaking action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe -- in the
sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benzene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); emphasis was supplied in original].'' Thus, the national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress
instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning
the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C.  655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant
safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized
that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a fortiori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their
employers out of business.') [

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,'
but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the
industry)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably
below this level. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27, 360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility
of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of
90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 &mu;g/m3
was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29, 245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility
of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small
firms.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions, OSHA conducts rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of
section 6 of the OSH Act. The rulemaking process enables the Agency to determine the qualitative and, if possible,
the quantitative nature of the risk with (and without) regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance,
the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the
industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher
costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See

 generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which
provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety
standards (29 U.S.C.  659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors.

, 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce
a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being
done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these bounds,
further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful
comment militate against regulatory extremes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.
(See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised
PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling
objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards
subject to section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*  by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases
and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety.

[The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful
may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be
toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to
make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [

In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the
most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (

The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances *&blank;*&blank;* was because Congress
recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case,
the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been
exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [

Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,
the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation
of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
`health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported
the OSHA position (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory
scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject
to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust (

that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety.

, above, OSHA has determined that the non-use or misuse of appropriate PPE poses significant risks to employees and
that the provisions of the final rule are reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from those risks. The
Agency estimates that compliance with the revised PPE standard will cost $52.4 million annually and will reduce the
risk of the identified hazards (preventing 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually). This constitutes a substantial
reduction of significant risk of material harm for the exposed population of approximately 22 million general industry
employees. The Agency believes that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates
that the PPE required by the standard is already in general use throughout the industries covered by the standard.
Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented in the Regulatory
Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs during the standard's first
five years, and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs thereafter.

OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to PPE-related hazards in a large range of industries. The

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Section IV, above, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the revised PPE standard in terms of the Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for the industries regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency acknowledges that some industries covered by the revised PPE standard have more documented PPE-related
injuries or fatalities than do others. However, the record indicates that the hazards addressed by the standard exist
throughout general industry. OSHA does not believe that the significance of the risk associated with exposure to
PPE-related hazards within a given SIC classification is dependent on the number of incidents documented for that
particular industry sector. OSHA has set the scope of the revised PPE standard to address those situations where employees
are exposed to PPE-related hazards, regardless of the relative frequency of incidents. The Agency believes, based
on analysis of the elements of the hazards identified, there is sufficient information for OSHA to determine that
employees in the covered sectors face significant risks related to the non-use or misuse of PPE. Therefore, the Agency
has determined that all employees within the scope of the revised PPE standard face a significant risk of material
harm and that compliance with the revised PPE standard is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from
that risk, regardless of the number of injuries or fatalities reported for the SIC code to which the employer has been
assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate data analysis, OSHA has organized the pertinent injury and fatality information according
to the SIC code for the particular industry sectors where incidents have been reported. Given the limitations of the
OSHA database and the likelihood of misclassification (due, for example, to the difficulty of classifying contractors),
the Agency does not believe that the risks associated with the use or misuse of PPE vary according to the SIC code to which
employers have been assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed PPE standard on their merits
in the Section III, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Standard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, earlier in this preamble. In particular, OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their
impact on worker safety, their feasibility, their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) preempts state laws relating to issues
on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a State can avoid
preemption in issues covered by Federal standards only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the
development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such
Plan States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places
of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate
commerce they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal standard for personal protective equipment used in general industry addresses hazards that are not unique
to any one State or region of the country. Nonetheless, States with occupational safety and health plans approved
under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems which
might be encountered in a particular State. Moreover, because this standard is written in general, performance-oriented
terms, there is considerable flexibility for State plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of
compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in general
industry. Those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard,
and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the
State standards are at least as effective as that standard.

VII. State Plan States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and health plans must develop a comparable
standard applicable to both the private and public (state and local government employees) sectors within six months
of the publication date of a permanent final Federal rule or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because
an existing state standard covering this area is already ``at least as effective as'' the new Federal standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These States and territories are Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut (plan covers only State and local government
employees), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (plan
covers only State and local government employees), North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee,
Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the effective date of the Federal final rule, until such time as a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA
will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these States.

(1) The employer shall assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, which
necessitate the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). If such hazards are present, or likely to be present,
the employer shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Select, and have each affected employee use, the types of PPE that will protect the affected employee from the hazards
identified in the hazard assessment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Communicate selection decisions to each affected employee; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Select PPE that properly fits each affected employee.

Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The employer shall provide training to each employee who is required by this section to use PPE. Each such employee
shall be trained to know at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) What PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The limitations of the PPE; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, and the ability to use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the
understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee.
Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained
the requisite understanding or skill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The employer shall verify that each affected employee has received and understood the required training through
a written certification that contains the name of each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and that identifies
the subject of the certification.

particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious
light radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each affected employee shall use eye protection that provides side protection when there is a hazard from flying
objects. Detachable side protectors (e.g. clip-on or slide-on side shields) meeting the pertinent requirements
of this section are acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Each affected employee who wears prescription lenses while engaged in operations that involve eye hazards shall
wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in its design, or shall wear eye protection that can be worn
over the prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position of the prescription lenses or the protective
lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Eye and face PPE shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification of the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Each affected employee shall use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate for the work
being performed for protection from injurious light radiation. The following is a listing of appropriate shade numbers
for various operations.

* As a rule of thumb, start with a shade that is too dark to see the weld zone. Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient
view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high
yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum)
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when
the arc is hidden by the workpiece.

Appendix B to Subpart I_Non-mandatory Compliance Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment
Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix is intended to provide compliance assistance for employers and employees in implementing requirements
for a hazard assessment and the selection of personal protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlling hazards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards, but should be used in conjunction
with guards, engineering controls, and sound manufacturing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment and selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is necessary to consider certain general guidelines for assessing the foot, head, eye and face, and hand hazard
situations that exist in an occupational or educational operation or process, and to match the protective devices
to the particular hazard. It should be the responsibility of the safety officer to exercise common sense and appropriate
expertise to accomplish these tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to assess the need for PPE the following steps should be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Survey.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question. The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards
to workers and co-workers. Consideration should be given to the basic hazard categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Penetration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Compression (roll-over) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Harmful dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Light (optical) radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the walk-through survey the safety officer should observe: (a) sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes
where any movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movement of personnel that could result
in collision with stationary objects; (b) sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injury or ignition
of protective equipment, etc.; (c) types of chemical exposures; (d) sources of harmful dust; (e) sources of light
radiation, i.e., welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc.; (f) sources
of falling objects or potential for dropping objects; (g) sources of sharp objects which might pierce the feet or cut
the hands; (h) sources of rolling or pinching objects which could crush the feet; (i) layout of workplace and location
of co-workers; and (j) any electrical hazards. In addition, injury/accident data should be reviewed to help identify
problem areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Organize data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary to organize the data and information for use in the assessment
of hazards. The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in the environment to enable proper selection
of protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analyze data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Having gathered and organized data on a workplace, an estimate of the potential for injuries should be made. Each of
the basic hazards (paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewed and a determination made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness
of potential injury from each of the hazards found in the area. The possibility of exposure to several hazards simultaneously
should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 After completion of the procedures in paragraph 3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment is
to: a) Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of protective equipment that is available, and what
it can do; i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc.; b) compare the hazards associated with the environment;
i.e., impact velocities, masses, projectile shape, radiation intensities, with the capabilities of the available
protective equipment; c) select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum
required to protect employees from the hazards; and d) fit the user with the protective device and give instructions
on care and use of the PPE. It is very important that end users be made aware of all warning labels for and limitations
of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Fitting the device.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Careful consideration must be given to comfort and fit. PPE that fits poorly will not afford the necessary protection.
Continued wearing of the device is more likely if it fits the wearer comfortably. Protective devices are generally
available in a variety of sizes. Care should be taken to ensure that the right size is selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Devices with adjustable features.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Adjustments should be made on an individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the protective device in
the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fitting devices for eye protection against dust and chemical
splash to ensure that the devices are sealed to the face. In addition, proper fitting of helmets is important to ensure
that it will not fall off during work operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary to keep the helmet on an employee's
head. (Chin straps should break at a reasonably low force, however, so as to prevent a strangulation hazard). Where
manufacturer's instructions are available, they should be followed carefully. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Reassessment of hazards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is the responsibility of the safety officer to reassess the workplace hazard situation as necessary, by identifying
and evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing accident records, and reevaluating the suitability of previously
selected PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(1) Care should be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards.
Adequate protection against the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided. Protective devices do not
provide unlimited protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(2) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. As required by the standard, protection from both
hazards must be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(3) Faceshields should only be worn over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(4) As required by the standard, filter lenses must meet the requirements for shade designations in 1910.133(a)(5).
Tinted and shaded lenses are

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=12 g=1 f=1 -->
 filter lenses unless they are marked or identified as such. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(5) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires the use of prescription (Rx) lenses must wear either
protective devices fitted with prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be worn over regular prescription
(Rx) eyewear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(6) Wearers of contact lenses must also wear appropriate eye and face protection devices in a hazardous environment.
It should be recognized that dusty and/or chemical environments may represent an additional hazard to contact lens
wearers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(7) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protective devices in electrical hazard areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(8) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the protector can cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing
may be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(9) Welding helmets or faceshields should be used only over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(10) Non-sideshield spectacles are available for frontal protection only, but are not acceptable eye protection
for the sources and operations listed for ``impact.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(11) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splash entry. Eye and face protection should be designed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for head protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 All head protection (helmets) is designed to provide protection from impact and penetration hazards caused by falling
objects. Head protection is also available which provides protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from electric shock and burn. When selecting head protection, knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important.
Class A helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from low-voltage
conductors (they are proof tested to 2,200 volts). Class B helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance,
provide electrical protection from high-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 20,000 volts). Class C helmets
provide impact and penetration resistance (they are usually made of aluminum which conducts electricity), and should
not be used around electrical hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where falling object hazards are present, helmets must be worn. Some examples include: working below other workers
who are using tools and materials which could fall; working around or under conveyor belts which are carrying parts
or materials; working below machinery or processes which might cause material or objects to fall; and working on exposed
energized conductors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some examples of occupations for which head protection should be routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians,
linemen, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters, assemblers, packers, wrappers, sawyers, welders,
laborers, freight handlers, timber cutting and logging, stock handlers, and warehouse laborers.

Selection guidelines for foot protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Safety shoes and boots which meet the ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 Standard provide both impact and compression protection.
Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained which provide puncture protection. In some work situations, metatarsal
protection should be provided, and in other special situations electrical conductive or insulating safety shoes
would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required for carrying or handling materials such as packages,
objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and, for other activities where objects might fall onto the
feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection would be required for work activities involving skid trucks
(manual material handling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls) and around heavy pipes, all of which could
potentially roll over an employee's feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection would be required where
sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees
causing a foot injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection should be routinely considered are: shipping and
receiving clerks, stock clerks, carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and
pipe fitters, structural metal workers, assemblers, drywall installers and lathers, packers, wrappers, craters,
punch and stamping press operators, sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, gardeners and grounds-keepers,
timber cutting and logging workers, stock handlers and warehouse laborers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for hand protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Gloves are often relied upon to prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with chemicals that are capable of
causing local or systemic effects following dermal exposure. OSHA is unaware of any gloves that provide protection
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 potential hand hazards, and commonly available glove materials provide only limited protection against many chemicals.
Therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate glove for a particular application and to determine how
long it can be worn, and whether it can be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also important to know the performance characteristics of gloves relative to the specific hazard anticipated;
e.g., chemical hazards, cut hazards, flame hazards, etc. These performance characteristics should be assessed
by using standard test procedures. Before purchasing gloves, the employer should request documentation from the
manufacturer that the gloves meet the appropriate test standard(s) for the hazard(s) anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other factors to be considered for glove selection in general include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) As long as the performance characteristics are acceptable, in certain circumstances, it may be more cost effective
to regularly change cheaper gloves than to reuse more expensive types; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The work activities of the employee should be studied to determine the degree of dexterity required, the duration,
frequency, and degree of exposure of the hazard, and the physical stresses that will be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to selection of gloves for protection against chemical hazards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The toxic properties of the chemical(s) must be determined; in particular, the ability of the chemical to cause
local effects on the skin and /or to pass through the skin and cause systemic effects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Generally, any ``chemical resistant'' glove can be used for dry powders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For mixtures and formulated products (unless specific test data are available), a glove should be selected on
the basis of the chemical component with the shortest breakthrough time, since it is possible for solvents to carry
active ingredients through polymeric materials; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Employees must be able to remove the gloves in such a manner as to prevent skin contamination.

Cleaning and maintenance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly important for eye and
face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of compliance with 1910.132 (a) and (b), PPE should be inspected, cleaned, and maintained at regular
intervals so that the PPE provides the requisite protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that
protects employees from exposure to hazards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending for editorial purposes its regulations on the Inmate Financial Responsibility
Program, Non-discrimination Toward Inmates, and Civil Contempt of Court Commitments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final rule on the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (28 CFR 545.10 to 545.11) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 May 21, 1991 (56 FR 23477). This publication contained a typographical error (``Court-Ordered restriction'' rather
than ``Court-ordered restitution'') in &sect;545.11(a)(2). This document accordingly correctly revises that
paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule on Non-Discrimination Toward Inmates (28 CFR 551.90) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 4, 1980 (45 FR 23366). This document amends &sect;551.90 to use the term ``disability'' instead of the term
``handicap''. This amendment is intended to conform to terminology used in current statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule on Civil Contempt of Court Commitments (28 CFR 522.10 to 522.11) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38244). This document amends &sect;522.11(g) to include reference to subsequent statutory citations.
This document also revises the authority citation for the part for the sake of editorial consistency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these amendments are editorial in nature and impose no new restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good
cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed
rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments
concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive
no response in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish Fair Market Rents (FMRs)

Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subparts A and B), including space rentals by owners of manufactured
homes under the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subpart F); the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
program (part 882, subparts D and E); Section 8 housing assisted under part 886, subparts A and C (Section 8 Loan Management
and Property Disposition programs); and are used to determine payment standard schedules in the Rental Voucher program
(part 887).

HUD published proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 FMRs for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program on May 6, 1993 (58 FR
27062) and solicited public comments for a 60-day period. The FY 1994 FMRs were the first to be developed with revisions
based on use of the 1990 Census data; they also included post-Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) and Random Digit
Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys. Because of the large number of requests in response to changes in the FMRs caused
by the Census data rebenchmarking, the public comment period was extended to August 31, 1993 by notice on July 6, 1993
(58 FR 36175).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 1, 1993, HUD published final FMRs for all areas, including over 600 areas that still had comments under review.
The FMRs for those areas were retained at the levels of the previous year (FY 1993) pending completion of the review
of the comments. This review has now been completed and today's notice announces final FY 1994 FMR schedules for the
areas under review. The FMR schedules for all areas are included in this notice to avoid the confusion of having more
than one publication of FY 1994 FMRs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437f) authorizes a housing assistance program
to aid lower income families in renting decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Assistance payments are limited by Fair
Market Rents (FMRs), or payment standards in the Rental Voucher Program, established by HUD for different areas.
In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to rent privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary
rental housing of a modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities. Section 8(c) of the Act requires the Secretary
of HUD to publish FMRs periodically, but not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year.
The FMRs must reflect changes based on the most recent available data so FMRs will be current for the year in which they
apply.

Metropolitan Area Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 6, 1993 publication of the proposed FMRs, HUD announced that the FMR area definitions, with several exceptions,
incorporated the changes made in the definitions of metropolitan areas by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB
Bulletin No. 93&hyph;05). The HUD exceptions were for nine large metropolitan areas whose revised OMB definitions
encompassed areas larger than what HUD considers appropriate for FMR area definitions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At that time, the metropolitan area definitions for both the Boston and New York-Northern New Jersey areas were still
under review by OMB. HUD decided, therefore, to continue using the previous definitions until OMB made its final decisions
and HUD could evaluate them. On June 30, 1993, OMB announced its revised definitions in OMB Bulletin NO. 93&hyph;17.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB's final decisions were, with minor differences, to return to the pre-1993 definitions for both the Boston and
New York-Northern New Jersey areas. For the Boston area, the only significant change was to combine the former Salem-Gloucester
PMSA with the former Boston PMSA to form the new Boston MA-NH PMSA. This change increased the FMRs for the Salem-Glouchester
area, but did not change the Boston area FMRs. For the New York-Northern New Jersey area, Pike County, Pennsylvania
was combined with Orange County, New York to form the Newburgh NY-PA PMSA. This had the effect of increasing the FMRs
for Pike County but did not change those for Orange County. Because these changes had no significant impact on HUD's
existing FMR areas, the October 1 publication adopted the revised OMB definitions of the Primary Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (PMSAs) that comprise the greater Boston and the greater New York metropolitan areas as the area definitions
for the final FY 1994 FMRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD also proposed in the May 6, 1993 publication to modify the FMR area definitions for seven other metropolitan areas
by deleting counties that OMB had added to its revised definitions. The decision to delete these counties was based
on an evaluation conducted by HUD headquarters and field staff. The counties deleted from the FMR areas are those that
are the most remote from the central cities/counties of the metropolitan area and have the lowest rents, in most cases
significantly below the FMR area rent averages. They are as follows:

The counties deleted from the FMR areas are included in Schedule B within their respective states as separate metropolitan
FMR areas. The only comments received concerning the revised FMR areas for the above areas were several from Lake County,
Illinois, requesting that it be designated a separate FMR area independent of the Chicago FMR area. On the basis of
its analysis, HUD has determined that Lake County is appropriately categorized as part of the Chicago housing market
area and should remain a part of the Chicago FMR area. HUD, therefore, has not changed the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB also modified the definitions of four other metropolitan areas in its final Bulletin. The four are: Augusta-Aiken,
GA-SC; Baton Rouge, LA; Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH; Wilmington, NC. HUD is implementing the new definitions
because the changes involved adding small counties that did not affect the FMRs or significantly alter the FMR area
definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD also proposed in the May 6, 1993 Notice that the FMRs for the independent cities and surrounding counties in Virginia
be established by combining the city and county data, rather than having separate FMRs for the cities and counties.
The final FY 1994 FMRs are based on the following FMR areas:

FMR Standard: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMRs are gross rent estimates; they include shelter rent and the cost of utilities, except telephone. HUD sets
FMRs to assure that a sufficient supply of rental housing is available to program participants. To accomplish this
objective, FMRs must be both high enough to permit a selection of units and neighborhoods and low enough to serve as
many families as possible. The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution
of standard quality rental housing units. The current definition used is the 45th percentile rent, the dollar amount
below which 45 percent of the standard quality rental housing units rent. The 45th percentile rent is drawn from the
distribution of rents of units are occupied by recent movers (renter households who moved into their unit within the
past 15 months). Public housing units and newly built units less than two years old are excluded.

Data Sources: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD used the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates. Three sources of survey data were
used as the basis for the base-year estimates. They are: (1) The 1990 Census; (2) the RDD telephone surveys conducted
since the Census; and (3) the post-1990 Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) available up to the time the FMR estimates
were prepared. The base-year FMRs were then updated using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for rents and utilities
or the HUD Regional rent change factors developed from RDD surveys. Annual average CPI data are available individually
for 95 metropolitan FMR areas. RDD Regional rent change factors are developed annually for the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan
parts of each of the 10 HUD Regions (a total of 20 separate factors). The RDD factors are used to update the base year estimates
for all FMR areas that do not have their own local CPI survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decennial Census provides statistically reliable rent data for use in establishing base-year FMRs. AHSs are
conducted by the Bureau of the Census for HUD and have accuracy comparable to the decennial Census. These surveys enable
HUD to develop between-census revisions for 44 of the largest metropolitan areas on a revolving schedule of 11 areas
annually. The RDD telephone survey technique is based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select random
samples of rental housing, dial and keep track of the telephone numbers and tabulate the responses. RDD surveys are
designed to produce FMR estimates that are within two to four percent of the actual 45th percentile rent.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the proposed FY 1994 FMRs, HUD received over 2,500 comments covering more than 1,100 FMR areas. The first
publication on October 1, 1993 included final FMRs (held at the FY 1993 levels) for the areas for which the review of
public comments had not been completed. HUD announced in that publication that there would be a second publication
of FMRs for those areas and for those with RDD surveys still under review. The final count of FMR areas under consideration
was 669, including 40 FMR areas for which both public comments and RDD surveys were submitted. The areas under review
are identified in this publication with a ``+'' symbol next to the FMR schedule for the areas that had both comments
and RDD surveys; and with an ``*'' next to the FMR schedule for all other areas with comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD carefully evaluated all information submitted with the public comments. Based on this evaluation, the FMRs for
572 areas have been revised. This total includes revised FMRs for: 165 areas that were increased based on the survey
data submitted by the commenters; 39 areas that were increased as the result of RDD surveys; and 368 areas that submitted
incomplete information but that HUD was able to supplement with available information. The amount of the FMR increase
was not always the same as the amount requested by the commenters. For the 165 areas notified with survey data, the increases
sometimes differed because commenters requested a return to the FY 1993 FMRs even though their surveys showed something
different. In other cases, the survey data had to be re-tabulated and corrected; this resulted in revised FMRs that
are sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the requested modifications. The increases approved for the 368 areas,
with incomplete but usable data, generally were smaller than those requested by the commenter and generally applied
only to the one- and two-bedroom unit sizes. The information submitted for 97 FMR areas was not sufficient to provide
a basis for revising the FMRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed their concern that owners would have to accept the reduced FMRs and would not renew leases
at a lower rent, and families would be forced to move. The Department wants to assure the PHAs administering the program
and the families that are currently participating in the Section 8 program that current participants will not be forced
to move or have to pay a higher portion of the rent. The rents specified in the housing assistance contract between the
owner and the PHA will continue to be paid by the PHA unless the owner requests a rent increase in accordance with the
provisions of the housing assistance contract. In such cases, the rent increase will be calculated using the annual
adjustment factors and will be approved by the PHA if the new rent does not exceed the amount of rent charged for comparable
unassisted units. The amount of rent the family pays will continue to be based on the family's income, and for families
in the rental voucher program the applicable payment standard. The new FMRs will be used for new families entering
the program or for current participants when they move to a new unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, PHA officials expressed concern about the impact that the reduced FMRs would have on administrative
fees and, therefore, their continuing capacity to administer the program. The calculation of PHA administrative
fees for FY 1994 is subject to a recent statutory change. FY 1994 administrative fees are calculated using the FY 1993
FMRs if there was a decrease in the FMRs. However, if the FY 1994 FMRs are higher, the law limited the fee increase to 3.5
percent above the FY 1993 fee. HUD Notice PIH&hyph;93&hyph;66(HA), which was issued on December 16, 1993, contains
detailed information on how FY 1994 administrative fees should be calculated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both HUD and PHAs used RDD telephone surveys to test the reliability of the proposed FY 1994 FMRs in areas with large
decreases proposed in FY 1994 FMRs. Of the 46 HUD RDD surveys completed since the proposed FMRs were published, 21 had
results that were higher than the proposed FMRs and 24 had results that were lower or not statistically different.
FMRs for eighteen areas were increased based on the results of PHA-funded RDD surveys. PHAs that funded surveys which
produced FMR estimates below those proposed opted not to comment, so comparative data are not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the areas where RDD survey FMRs are higher than the proposed FMRs, the FMRs published for effect are based on the
RDD surveys. The FY 1993 FMRs and the proposed and final FY 1994 FMRs for these areas are as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD continues to recommend use of RDD surveys to test the accuracy of FMRs for areas where there is a sufficient number
of Section 8 units to justify the survey cost of $12,000&hyph;$20,000. Areas with 500 or more units meet this criterion,
and areas with fewer units may meet it if the actual two-bedroom FMR rent standard is significantly different than
that proposed by HUD. Interested organizations concerned about FMR accuracy may wish to begin contracting for an
RDD survey in the next few months to assure that the results will be available in time to be incorporated into the FY 1995
FMRs. It takes two to three months to obtain survey rent estimates after contract award. The ``PHA Guide To Conducting
A Fair Market Rent Telephone Survey'' is available from HUD USER by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;245&hyph;2691. This
guide provides information on whether a PHA should consider using this approach, and it includes a draft contractor
solicitation letter and a Contract Statement of Work.

FMRs for Flood Damaged Areas in the Midwest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the authority granted in 24 CFR part 899, the Secretary finds good cause to waive the regulatory requirements
that govern requests for geographic area FMR exceptions for the flood areas that were declared Federal disaster areas.
Recognizing that there are a large number of FMR areas that experienced substantial losses as a result of the floods
of the past summer in the midwestern states which will have a direct effect on local rent levels, HUD is prepared to grant
FMR exceptions under the following conditions. FMR exceptions up to 10 percent above the final FY 1994 FMRs may be approved
for single-county FMR areas and for individual county parts of multi-county FMR areas. The flood-related FMR exceptions
will be approved by the HUD field office with jurisdiction on the grounds that: (1) The affected counties qualify as
disaster areas under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (2) the PHA certifies
that demand pressures and/or damage to the rental housing stock is so substantial that it has resulted in an increase
in the prevailing rent levels. Such exceptions must be requested in writing by the responsible PHAs. The exceptions
approved for this special disaster-related purpose will remain in effect until superseded by final FY 1995 FMRs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment as required by the National Environmental Policy
Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4374) is unnecessary, since the Section 8 Rental Certificate program is categorically
excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The undersigned, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), hereby certifies that this
notice does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because FMRs do not change
the rent from that which would be charged if the unit were not in the Section 8 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that
this notice will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. The notice amends
Fair Market Rent schedules for various Section 8 assisted housing programs, and does not affect the amount of rent
a family receiving rental assistance pays, which is based on a percentage of the family's income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, Federalism, has
determined that this notice will not involve the preemption of the State law by Federal statute or regulation and does
not have Federalism implications. The Fair Market Rent schedules do not have any substantial direct impact on States,
on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibility
among the various levels of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.156, Lower-Income Housing Assistance Program (section
8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Fair Market Rent Schedules, which will not be codified in 24 CFR Part 888, are amended as follows:

a. FMRs for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (Schedule B) are established for Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(MSAs), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs), other HUD-designated metropolitan FMR areas. FMRs also
are established for nonmetropolitan counties and county equivalents in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands and the Pacific Islands and for nonmetropolitan parts of counties in the New England states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. FMRs for the areas in Virginia shown in the table below are established by combining the 1990 Census data for the nonmetropolitan
counties with the data for the independent cities that are located within the county borders. Because of space limitations,
the FMR listing in Schedule B includes only the name of the nonmetropolitan County. The full definitions of these areas
including the independent cities are as follows:
