 This rule gives notice of proposed amendments to the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order. These
amendments would revise the definition of the term ``lime'' in order to cover seedless rather than seeded limes; increase
the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; alter the size, composition, and term
of office of the Lime Board; and make necessary conforming changes. This action is necessary to implement amendments
to the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 1990.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 CFR part 1212), herein referred to as the Order. The Order is effective under the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer
Information Act of 1990 (1990 Act) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, 7 U.S.C. 6201&hyph;6212), as amended by the Lime Research,
Promotion, and Consumer Information Improvement Act (1993 Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;194, Dec. 14, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be non-significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
1957 of the Act, a person subject to the Order may file a petition with the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) stating
that the Order or any provision of the Order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Order, is not in accordance
with law and requesting a modification of the Order or an exemption from the Order. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity
for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides
that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries
on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that
purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Act exempted lime producers who produce less than 35,000 pounds annually for the fresh market from being subject
to the Order. When the 1990 Act was enacted, there were an estimated 325 producers who produced at least 35,000 pounds
annually and were subject to the Order. When the 1993 Act was enacted, the exemption level was increased to less than
200,000 pounds annually. At this exemption level, there are an estimated 50 producers who produce at least 200,000
pounds and would be subject to the Order. Despite this increase in exemption level, the majority of producers subject
to the Order would still be classified as small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small
Business Administration (SBA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in exemption level is not expected to significantly affect the number of first handlers who are responsible
for collecting and remitting producer assessments to the Lime Board (Board). The number of first handlers remains
at approximately 25. The increase in exemption level, which also applies to imports, is not expected to significantly
affect the number of importers of fresh market limes. The number of importers subject to the Order would increase from
5 to 35. However, this increase in importers is not primarily due to the increase in the exemption level but rather to
the changing character of the lime industry. As in the case of producers, the majority of first handlers and importers
subject to the Order would still be classified as small entities. Small agricultural service firms, which include
handlers and importers, have been defined by the SBA as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the enactment of the 1990 Act, the character of the lime industry has significantly changed. As a result of the
extensive damage to lime orchards in Florida by Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, domestic production has plummeted
and the volume of imports has increased dramatically. Domestic production is not expected to reach pre-Hurricane
Andrew levels for possibly two to three years because Florida accounted for a majority of domestic production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shipment reports of domestic limes, from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, indicate truck shipments of
8.71 million pounds from Florida and 8.24 million pounds from California, for a total of 16.95 million pounds. In contrast,
shipment reports of imported limes for this period indicate truck shipments of 248.22 million pounds from Mexico
plus an additional 8.78 million pounds from 12 other countries. Imports currently represent roughly 93 percent of
lime shipments in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order currently requires lime producers, producer-handlers, and importers who produce or import 35,000 pounds
or more annually for fresh market to pay an assessment not to exceed one cent per pound of limes. This proposal would
limit assessment obligations to producers, producer-handlers, and importers of 200,000 pounds or more annually.
The expected results of this amendment would significantly decrease the number of persons subject to the Order and
decrease the amount of assessments collected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would also alter the size and composition of the Board, the administrative body appointed by the Secretary
to operate the Order, from 11 members to seven. Further, this proposal would reduce the number of producer members
serving on the Board from seven to three. The number of importer members would remain at three. The seventh member would
be the public member. These changes to the Board's size and membership are reflective of the current structure of the
lime industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the changes reflected in this action would not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) the information collection requirements
contained in the Order have been approved by the OMB and were assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093, except for the Board
nominee background statement form which was assigned OMB number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0505&hyph;0001. This action would generally reduce the number of information collections, and hence the reporting
burden. The information collection requirements of the Order are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A periodic report by each first handler who handles limes for fresh market. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the amended Order is implemented, the estimated number of respondents required to complete this report would
be 25, each submitting a maximum of 12 responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes
per response. The change in exemption level, from less than 35,000 pounds to less than 200,000 pounds, should not affect
the number of first handlers. However, this change could reduce their reporting burden because less information
may be required from persons who previously would not be exempt from the Order. First handlers may alternatively prepay
assessments annually, requiring only an initial report of anticipated assessments and a final annual report of actual
handling; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A periodic report by each importer who imports 200,000 or more pounds annually for fresh market. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated number of respondents completing this report would be 35, each submitting a maximum of 12 responses
per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in character of the lime
industry due to increased imports since 1992 would raise the number of respondents filing this report from 5 to 35;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A refund application form for persons who desire a refund of their assessments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be five, each submitting two responses per
year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in exemption level would reduce
the number of respondents filing this application from 200 to 5; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
An importer reimbursement application for persons who import less than 200,000 pounds annually and desire to be reimbursed
for assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be 20, each submitting one response per year,
with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. Because this is a new form, no comparative data
regarding an increase or decrease in reporting burden is available;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
An exemption application for persons who produce or import less than 200,000 pounds annually for fresh market to be
exempt from assessments and recordkeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be 600, each submitting one response per year,
with an estimated average burden of 15 minutes per response. The changes in exemption level and character of the lime
industry would reduce the number of respondents filing this application from 680 to 600; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A referendum ballot to be used not later than 30 months after assessments begin under the amended Order and periodically
thereafter to indicate whether producers and importers favor continuance of the Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated number of respondents completing this ballot would be 85, each submitting one response approximately
every five years, or an annual average of 10 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes
per response. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of respondents completing this ballot from 325
to 85; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A nominee background statement form for Board member and alternate positions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two nominees would be nominated for each open position on the Board. The estimated number of respondents completing
this form would be 28 during the first year of Order operations, and approximately eight per year thereafter, with
an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes per response. The change in the composition of the Board would
reduce the number of respondents completing this form from 44 to 28; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A requirement to maintain records sufficient to verify reports submitted under the Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated number of persons required to comply with this requirement would be 70, each of whom will have an estimated
annual burden of seven minutes. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of recordkeepers from 350 to
70.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Act was enacted on November 28, 1990, for the purpose of establishing an orderly procedure for the development
and financing of an effective and coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information to strengthen
the domestic and foreign markets for limes. The Order required by the 1990 Act became effective on January 27, 1992
(57 FR 2985), after notice and comment rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1992 the Department of Agriculture (Department) conducted nomination meetings to nominate lime producers
and importers for appointment to the Board. The Board members were appointed by the Secretary in September 1992, and
the Board conducted its first meeting at the Department in Washington, DC in October 1992. During the course of this
meeting, the Board and the Department concluded that a technical amendment was needed to cover seedless rather than
seeded limes. Consequently, full implementation of the Order was delayed until the enactment of such technical amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Act contained the necessary technical amendment to cover seedless limes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citrus latifolia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) rather than seeded limes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citrus aurantifolia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) under the Order. The 1993 Act also provided for (1) increasing the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually
to less than 200,000; (2) terminating the initial Board; (3) changing the size and composition of the Board; and (4)
delaying the initial referendum date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule invites comments on amending the Order to reflect the provisions of the 1993 Act. The Act, as amended,
will (1) revise the definition of the term ``lime'' from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citrus aurantifolia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citrus latifolia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; (2) increase the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; (3) alter the size, composition,
and term of office of the Board; and (4) make conforming changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would change the definition of the ``lime'' from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citrus aurantifolia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(seeded lime) to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
citrus latifolia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(seedless lime) in &sect;1212.5 of the Order. Although the intent of the Act was to cover seedless limes, the definition
of ``lime'' in &sect;1953(6) of the 1990 applied only to seeded limes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would increase the producer and importer exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than
200,000 pounds annually. This revised exemption level was reached through industry consensus. Therefore, this
rule would change references to 35,000 pounds in &sect;&sect;1212.65, 1212.68, and 1212.69 of the Order to 200,000
pounds. In addition, a new paragraph (d) has been added to &sect;1212.68 of the Order whereby exempt importers may
obtain a refund of assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this rule would change the size of the Board from 11 members to seven. The Board is currently composed of seven
producer members, three importer members, and their alternates. The public member position is currently vacant.
This action would decrease the number of producer members from seven to three, which would more fairly reflect the
current structure of the lime industry. Therefore, &sect;&sect;1212.30, 1212.32, and 1212.34 of the Order would
be revised to make these changes in the Board's composition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would also change the Board's composition in &sect;1212.30(b) relative to representation of producer
and importer members within the two districts established under the Order. District 1 includes the States east of
the Mississippi River, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. District 2 includes the States west of the Mississippi
River. Currently, the Order provides for six producer members and one importer member and their alternates from District
1, and one producer member and two importer members and their alternates from District 2. This action would reduce
the number of producer members from District 1 from six to two by revising section 1212.30 of the Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, as a result of this allocation of Board membership, the realignment of districts or reapportionment of membership
between Districts 1 and 2 on the basis of changes in production and importation would no longer be necessary. Such realignment
or reapportionment would be inconsistent with the 1993 Act. Therefore, any references to such realignment or reapportionment
would be removed from &sect;&sect;1212.18, 1212.30, and 1212.40 of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing the size of the Board affects the current requirements for a quorum and the number of trustees which would
be designated if the program were to be terminated. Therefore, this action would revise &sect;1212.37 of the Order
to decrease from six to four the number of members needed to constitute a quorum at Board meetings and change the number
of trustees designated in &sect;1212.84 of the Order from five to four. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Act requires the appointments of the current Board members to be terminated. New appointments would then
be made by the Secretary. The 1993 Act also specifies that the initial Board members under the amended Order would serve
initial terms of office of 30 months. This change is directly related to the provision of the 1993 Act which delays the
deadline for the initial referendum until 30 months after the date on which the collection of assessments begin under
the amended Order. We are also proposing a conforming change in &sect;1212.67 of the Order pursuant to the 1993 provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide administrative continuity during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 months prior to the initial continuance referendum, the 1993 Act provides that the initial Board members under
the amended Order serve 30-month concurrent terms of office. The 1990 Act provided for the staggering of the terms
of office of the initial Board members. Although staggered terms of office are generally desirable, this created
a situation where 30 percent or more of the Board's membership could change prior to the initial referendum. In contrast,
the 1993 Act provides that the initial Board members under the amended Order serve 30-month concurrent terms of office
and that staggered terms be reinstituted after the referendum if the program continues. The purpose of this change
is to minimize the organizational uncertainties associated with Board member turnover and to facilitate organizational
continuity during the period prior to the initial referendum. Therefore, this action would also amend section 1212.34
of the Order.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland
Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the potentiometer lever
stops on the nose wheel steering. This proposal is prompted by a report that the potentiometer stops installed currently
on these airplanes are too short to limit excessive uncontrolled potentiometer movement in the event of a mechanical
link failure. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the airplane from departing the runway
during takeoff or landing in the event of the failure of the mechanical link between the rudder pedals and the potentiometer.

advises that when a Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplane is in the high speed taxi mode during takeoff or landing, nose
gear steering is limited to 7 degrees left or right of center and is controlled through rudder pedal movement. Rotary
movement of the rudder input quadrant is transmitted to a dual potentiometer via a mechanical link and fork lever.
The potentiometer converts this movement into electrical signals, which are sent to an electronic control unit (ECU)
located in the nose of the airplane. Subsequently, the ECU signals the electro-hydraulic actuator on the nose gear,
thereby rotating the nose gear in the required direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the mechanical link connecting the potentiometer to the rudder input quadrant fails, excessive uncontrolled
potentiometer lever movement is restricted by small metal stops located outside the normal angular travel of the
fork lever. These ``potentiometer stops'' limit the size of the signal sent to the ECU only in the event of a mechanical
link failure. On certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes, the currently installed potentiometer stops
are too short to restrict excessive fork lever movement in the event of a mechanical link failure. In this case, a signal
that is too large would be sent to the ECU, which could cause the nose gear to exceed its 7-degree limitation. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the airplane departing the runway during takeoff or landing.

Bombardier Inc. has issued de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;32&hyph;99, Revision `A,' dated July 26, 1993,
that describes procedures for modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering (Modification
8/1809) on certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes. Accomplishment of this modification
will restore overtravel protection by relocating the potentiometer lever stops. Relocation of the stops will ensure
that excessive fork lever movement is restricted in the event of a mechanical link failure. Transport Canada Aviation
classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive (AD) No. CF&hyph;93&hyph;24,
dated September 29, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the effectivity of the service bulletin includes certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series
airplanes, Canadian AD No. CF&hyph;93&hyph;24 is applicable only to certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series
airplanes. The service bulletin states that the potentiometer stops on certain Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series
airplanes are contacted by the lever prematurely, resulting in deformation of the stops. However, the FAA has been
advised that, although deformation of the potentiometer stops on these airplanes can occur, excessive potentiometer
lever movement would still be restricted in the event of failure of a mechanical link. In light of this information,
the FAA finds that Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes are not subject to the addressed unsafe condition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the potentiometer lever stops
on the nose wheel steering. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 48 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The
cost for required parts would be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $7,920, or $165 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 17, 1993, the Commission issued Rel. Nos. 33&hyph;7038 and IC&hyph;19959 (Dec. 17, 1993) [58 FR 68585
(Dec. 28, 1993)] (``Release No. 19959''), which proposed amendments to rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and related rules and forms. The proposed amendments would tighten the risk-limiting conditions imposed
on tax exempt money market funds by rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940; impose additional disclosure
requirements on tax exempt funds; and make certain other changes to the Commission rules and forms applicable to all
money market funds. The amendments are designed both to reduce the likelihood that a tax exempt fund will not be able
to maintain a stable net asset value and to increase investor awareness of the risks of investment in a money market
fund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since Release No. 19959 was published, the Commission has received two requests from interested persons for an extension
of the comment period. In light of the importance of the amendments to money market funds and the short-term tax exempt
securities markets and the benefits to the Commission of receiving carefully considered comments, the Commission
believes a one month extension of the comment period is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for responding to Release No. 19959 is extended to May 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) required that FDA consider health claims on
food labels for 10 nutrient-disease relationships and determine, based on the totality of the publicly available
scientific evidence, whether there is significant scientific agreement among qualified experts regarding the
validity of these relationships. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993, FDA issued final rules announcing its decision not to authorize the use on the label or labeling
of foods of health claims relating to an association between dietary fiber and cancer (58 FR 2537) or dietary fiber
and coronary heart disease (58 FR 2552). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a claim relating
dietary fiber to reduced risk of cancer was adequately supported by the totality of publicly available scientific
evidence. FDA concluded that the role for dietary fiber itself was not supported by the available data, but that consumption
of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may be associated with reduced
risk of some cancers (58 FR 2537 at 2548). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also concluded that there was not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a claim
relating dietary fiber to reduced risk of coronary heart disease was adequately supported by the totality of publicly
available scientific evidence. As was the case with respect to dietary fiber and cancer, FDA concluded that the role
of fiber itself was not supported by the available data, but that consumption of diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol
and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, may be associated
with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (58 FR 2552 at 2578).

In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296), FDA published a proposed rule not to authorize health claims on five nutrient-disease
relationships, including dietary fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease, for dietary supplements
of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances. In that proposal, FDA reviewed the available
evidence on the relationship of dietary fiber and cancer and on the relationship of dietary fiber and coronary heart
disease. Based on its tentative conclusion that there is not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts
that the totality of publicly available scientific evidence supported these nutrient-disease relationships,
FDA proposed not to authorize claims on these relationships. On January 4, 1994, in a new statutorily-mandated rulemaking,
changes in the agency's regulations (21 CFR 101.71(a) and (b)) reflecting those that FDA had proposed in October 1993,
became final by operation of law (see 59 FR 436, January 4, 1994). However, the rulemakings that FDA instituted in October
1993 continue (59 FR 436).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 12 and 13, 1994, FDA will cosponsor a public conference with other units of the Department of Health and Human
Services, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American
Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Institute of Medicine, the American Medical Association, the
Federal Trade Commission, and the Congressional Research Service to review the publicly available evidence on the
relationship of dietary fiber and cancer and the relationship of dietary fiber and coronary heart disease with particular
emphasis on refining the issues relative to dietary fiber definition and levels to disease risk. The purpose of this
public conference is to update and summarize the scientific information available on these associations and to discuss
criteria that should be used to determine whether a significant scientific agreement on the validity of these nutrient-disease
relationships exists. FDA is taking this action because it is aware, based on its review of the evidence on these nutrients-disease
relationships, that at least some promising evidence exists. The agency believes that the conference will help elucidate
whether recent developments have provided the basis for significant scientific agreement. The agency notes that
the review of the issues regarding dietary fiber/disease claims on dietary supplements is ongoing. FDA solicits
the input of all segments of the food industry and of other interested persons on these issues, however, because the
agency intends, if the evidence justifies, to authorize any claims that are warranted for foods in conventional food
form as well as for dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has invited experts in medicine, nutrition, epidemiology, pathology, and other disciplines related to dietary
fiber and cancer and dietary fiber and coronary heart disease to serve as speakers and panelists. They will summarize
and update the publicly available evidence, react to any evidence that is presented, and provide additional comment
based on their individual expertise. Others may submit data from new research and will be given the opportunity to
participate during the open discussions. Cancer and coronary heart disease will be the focus of the conference because
they are the diseases that were highlighted by the 1990 amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conference will be divided into four major parts as follows: (1) Opening and overview of dietary fiber; (2) dietary
fiber and coronary heart disease; (3) dietary fiber and cancer; and (4) the criteria for determining whether significant
scientific agreement on dietary fiber and cancer or dietary fiber and coronary heart disease exits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing
of fish and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with HACCP
principles. Interested persons were given until April 28, 1994, to comment on the proposal. However, because of an
inadvertent error, the date for submission of comments was incorrectly given as March 29, 1994. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 3, 1994 (59 FR 10085), FDA published a proposed rule to correct the comment period to April 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has received several requests from trade associations, State agencies, and university officials for an extension
of the comment period in order to better review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 90-day extension,
although one request is for an unspecified length and another is for about 120 days. FDA also received a request from
a public advocacy organization that the comment period either not be extended at all or that it be extended no more than
30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow an additional 30
days for comment. With the additional period, the agency is providing a total of 120 days for comment. FDA considers
that this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly,
the agency is extending the comment period to May 31, 1994. Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is publishing a notice extending the comment period of the ``Fish and Fish Products Hazards and Controls Guide''
until May 31, 1994. That guide has been developed to serve, among other things, as an adjunct to the proposed regulations.

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the
``Colorado program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
consists of changes to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Division of Minerals and Geology (DMG) of the
Colorado Department of Natural Resources and the Water Quality Control Division (WQCD) of the Colorado Department
of Health that addresses water quality management at coal mines. The revised MOU provides for the collection of water
quality samples by DMG for analysis when DMG suspects an unpermitted discharge, clarifies that WQCD is solely responsible
for enforcement of the Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) program, and provides for the issuance of a cessation
order by DMG in those instances of imminent danger to health or safety or significant environmental harm. The amendment
is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the Federal regulations and SMCRA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated March 18, 1994, Colorado submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;604). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in response to a letter dated April 7, 1993 (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;539), that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). The concerns raised by OSM
in its 30 CFR part 732 letter pertained to a January 1985 MOU between the Colorado Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
and the Colorado Department of Health (DOH) which Colorado intended to supersede a December 15, 1980, MOU between
the two agencies. Whereas, OSM had approved the 1980 MOU, Colorado had not submitted the 1985 MOU to OSM, and OSM had
not approved it in accordance with 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17. The 1980 MOU provided that both DOH and DNR would inspect
coal mines for compliance with effluent limitations and specified that should either agency determine that a water
quality violation existed, either agency could take the appropriate enforcement action in accordance with its own
regulations. The 1985 MOU stated that, ``as a matter of general practice, DNR will be responsible for enforcing water
quality protection pertaining to the requirements for design and maintenance of structures and the requirements
to minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance from sources other than the point of discharge,'' while DOH ``will
be responsible for enforcing water quality control standards at the point of discharge.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its 30 CFR part 732 letter, OSM notified Colorado that the revised MOU was inconsistent with both SMCRA and the approved
Colorado program because under the division of responsibilities in the revised MOU, only DOH has the authority to
enforce effluent limitations, and that if and when DOH decides to exercise that authority, enforcement action is
taken only under the provisions of the Colorado Discharge Elimination System (CDES). The CDES is the State's water
pollution control program approved pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act and is not the coal mining regulatory program
approved pursuant to SMCRA. Since the enforcement provisions of the CDES program do not require the citation of all
violations and do not include sanctions and procedures similar to those set forth in SMCRA, the Colorado program is
not in compliance with section 512(d) of SMCRA, which requires that a State program incorporate sanctions no less
stringent than SMCRA and contain the same or similar procedural requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado proposes to add new language to the section titled ``Inspections, Monitoring and Sample Analysis'' to provide
that in those instances where DMG suspects an unpermitted discharge, DMG shall collect a water quality sample for
analysis. Colorado proposes to add new language in the section titled ``Enforcement'' to provide that: (1) WQCD shall
be solely responsible for enforcement of the CDPS permit program against point source discharges of pollutants into
the State's surface waters that are conducted without an effective CDPS permit and for the enforcement of CDPS permit
conditions and (2) DMG will issue a cessation order if during a coal mine inspection, DMG determines that there is imminent
danger to the health or safety of the public or significant environmental harm to land, air or water resources.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 4 p.m., m.d.t. on April 22, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from barbecue charcoal ignition, municipal sewage plants, and municipal
landfills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intended effect of proposing approval of these revisions is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the
requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these revisions into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these
revisions and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs
for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules being proposed for approval into the California SIP include: South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD) Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal;''
SCAQMD Rule 1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations;'' and Ventura County Air Pollution Control District
(VCAPCD) Rule 74.17, ``Waste Disposal Sites.'' These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1991, September 14, 1992, and January 28, 1992 respectively.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles Area and the Ventura County Area. 43 FR 8964; 40
CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California
requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40
CFR 52.222. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended
Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q.
In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of
May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Los
Angeles Area is classified as extreme, and the Ventura County Area is classified as severe;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.

SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal,'' is
intended to reduce the emission of VOCs from the ignition of charcoal in residential barbecue grills. SCAQMD Rule
1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations,'' is designed to inventory the sources of VOCs and odoriferous
compounds from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. VCAPCD Rule 74.17, ``Waste Disposal Sites,'' is designed
to control emissions of non-methane organic compounds, including VOCs, from solid waste landfills through the use
of flares and other control technology. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. These rules
were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone
and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation
and proposed action for these rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents which specify the minimum requirements that a rule must contain in order to be approved
into the SIP. The CTG's are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what
is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other
Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182 (a) (2) (A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCAQMD Rules 1174 and 1179, and VCAPCD Rule 74.17 control emissions from source categories for which EPA has not issued
a CTG. Accordingly these rules were evaluated against the general RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act (section
110 and part D), 40 CFR part 51, EPA's ``Blue Book'' referred to in footnote 1, and against other EPA policy including
the EPA Region 9_CARB document entitled ``Guidance Document for Correcting VOC Rule Deficiencies'' (published
April, 1991). In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable
and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue Charcoal,'' is
a new rule which was adopted to reduce the emission of VOCs from the use of flammable materials to ignite barbecue charcoal.
SCAQMD Rule 1179, ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations,'' is a new rule which was adopted to inventory VOC
and odoriferous compound emissions from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. VCAPCD Rule 74.17, ``Solid
Waste Disposal Sites,'' is a new rule which was adopted to control emissions of VOCs from solid waste landfills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, SCAQMD Rule 1174, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Ignition of Barbecue
Charcoal'', Rule 1179 ``Publicly Owned Treatment Works Operations'', and Ventura County Air Pollution Control
District Rule 74.17 ``Solid Waste Disposal Sites'' are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the
CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

 The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts
I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or ``the Act''), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)
of 1990. The EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends
to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport
areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of title
I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''),
and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs
discussed in this notice, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July 1992).
The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 40 to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992, establishing
this emission statement program. Whatever minimum reporting level is established in a State emission statement
program, if either VOC or NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. The EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to the EPA through the
Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: certification
of data accuracy, source identification information, operating schedule, emissions information (to include annual
and typical ozone season day emissions), control equipment information, and process data. The EPA developed emission
statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency
is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all
EPA reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide the EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to the EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number
that have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total
annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncorrected for rule-effectiveness. States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent
in submitting their emission statement and that emit 500 tons per year (TPY) or more of VOC or 2500 TPY or more of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State
must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAAA
must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of section 110(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and
action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40
CFR part 51, Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations
within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, under section 110(k)(1)(B), a submittal is deemed complete by
operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt of the submission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State passed an emergency regulation after following all applicable State Administrative Procedures Act requirements
for submittal to the EPA by November 15, 1992, to satisfy CAA requirements. The State subsequently entered into State
rulemaking for a permanent regulation. It was submitted to public hearing on December 30, 1992. The State addressed
public comments and made minor adjustments. Following the public hearing, the final rule was adopted by the State
and submitted to the EPA as a proposed revision to the SIP on March 3, 1993. The permanent emission statement regulations
were then codified at LAC 33:III.919. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 3, 1993, SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness
criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found
to be complete, and a letter dated August 3, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the
submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. The provisions of the regulation are outlined under
the analysis of the State's submission below.

2. Components of Emission Statement Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP, and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements
for reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. SIP Revision Submission. Required within two years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of enactment of the CAAA of 1990 (November 15, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability
of the regulations, definitions for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered
by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. The emission statement submitted by the
source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the
individual certifying the statement, source identification information, operating information, process rate
data, control equipment information, and emissions information. These elements are described in greater detail
in section D of this document. The EPA recommends that the State program require the submission of the data from the
sources no later than April 15 of each year to insure that the State can meet the July 1 deadline for the submission of
data into AIRS each year. The guidance document prepared by the EPA provides a draft model State rule which can be used
as the basis for the States to develop their program. The guidance document also provides suggested language for the
specific program elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Sources Covered. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone
require emission statement data from sources of VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(marginal, moderate, etc.).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by the EPA (such as those found in EPA publication
AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to the EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional
Office to waive the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Reporting Requirements for Sources. The State requires facilities to report on a form supplied by the State. Sources
covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a minimum, the following data elements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Review of the State's Emission Statement Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicability of the regulation to ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection A.1. The rule applies
to the owner or operator of facilities in the State in an ozone nonattainment area emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC,
25 TPY of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or 100 TPY of carbon monoxide (CO), or any facility that has the potential to emit (``allowables'' in a facility's
permit) 50 TPY or more of VOC in an area designated as an ozone adjoining area. If either VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is emitted at or above the minimum required reporting level, the other pollutant must be included even if it is emitted
at levels below the specified cutoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Types of Inventories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Annual Emission Statement (AES) requirement for ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection B.1.
This subsection requires stationary sources identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsection A. to submit an AES for all criteria pollutant including VOC. The AES shall consist of an inventory of actual
emissions of VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Ozone Nonattainment Area Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement for ozone nonattainment area's statements is documented in subsection B.3. This subsection requires
stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC, 25 TPY of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

weekday emissions that occur during the three-month period of greatest or most frequent ozone exceedences as published
by the Department in the Enforcement and Regulatory Compliance notice that is mailed out monthly from the Division
of Legal Affairs and Enforcement. ``Typical weekday'' emissions are defined as an ``average'' of two actual daily
emissions rates (one at the lowest emission rate and one at the highest emission rate) during a seven-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Minimum Data Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minimum data requirements are documented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsection B.5. The data requirements include a certifying statement, facility identification information, operating
information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statement is required from the owner or operator to accompany the emission statement certifying that the information
is true and accurate to the best knowledge of the certifying official. The certification will include the name, title,
signature, date of signature, and telephone number of the certifying official (subsection B.5.a.).

Calculations of emissions are documented in subsection C. The subsection specifies actual measurement with continuous
monitoring systems (CEMS) is the desired method of calculating emissions from a point source. In lieu of CEMS data,
emissions may be calculated using methods found in the most recent edition of the Compilation of Air Pollution Emission
Factors (AP&hyph;42), or calculations published in Engineering Journals with prior administrative approval from
the Assistant Secretary.

regulation that permits the State to enforce the provisions of the regulation under all pertinent State enforcement
authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from
J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also
contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section
110(a)(2)(C)).

Technical Correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reviewing the State's submitted permanent regulation, a technical error was discovered in subsection B.2.a.
This subsection contains a reference to subsection B.2.d., when it should refer to subsection B.2.c. This appears
to be a typographical error and is not substantive since it is unlikely that it would lead to a misinterpretation of
the regulation. This error has been discussed with the State, and the State has agreed to amend the regulation to correct
the error through the State's rulemaking process. Final EPA rulemaking will not occur until the State has made the
correction and submitted documentation of evidence that the error has been corrected. The EPA expects the correction
will be made by June 30, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's action, the EPA is proposing final approval of the Louisiana emission statement program SIP submittal
and invites public comment on the action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis of the Louisiana regulation shows that it adequately addresses all components of an emission statement
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the State has agreed to provide the EPA with emission statement data for the EPA AIRS through the State's
grants commitments and to provide quarterly status reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 CAAA of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Regulatory Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have
a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are proposed revised regulations governing the annual competition for James Madison Fellowships
and the obligations of James Madison Fellows. They propose alterations and additions to the existing regulations
implementing the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act of 1986. These regulations govern the qualifications and
applications of candidates for fellowships; the selection of Fellows by the Foundation; the graduate programs Fellows
must pursue; the conditions attached to awards; the Foundation's annual Summer Institute on the Constitution; and
related requirements and expectations regarding fellowships.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed revised rule indicates changes in various activities of the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation
warranted by experience gained during the Foundation's first two annual fellowship competitions. While representing
no alteration in the Foundation's mission, nor any major changes in the original rule governing the Foundation's
operations, the proposed revisions embody some changes in eligibility requirements and application procedures
whose intended consequences are to enlarge the pool of potential fellowship applicants, reduce complications attendant
upon applying for fellowships, and make clearer certain matters under the previous rule. The principal ones of these
revisions are: (1) The elimination of procedures for the nomination of candidates for fellowships; (2) the enlargement
of the pool of eligible applicants to include experienced teachers in grades 7 and 8 as well as in grades 9&hyph;12;
(3) a reduction in the teaching experience required of applicants for senior fellowships; (4) the elimination of
the limit on the number of years following receipt of the baccalaureate degree in which candidates for junior fellowships
may apply; and (5) a change in the closing date for applications to March 1 annually. In addition, this proposed revised
rule sets forth for the first time information regarding the Foundation's annual Summer Institute on the Constitution.

The James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act authorizes fellowship support for graduate study by teachers of American
history and social studies and by college seniors or college graduates who wish to become teachers of the same subjects.
However, in order not to exclude from consideration for James Madison Fellowships those teachers or would-be teachers
whose current or future secondary school instruction, while concerning the usual subjects covered by courses in
American history and social studies, may be carried on in courses entitled ``government'' or similar names, this
rule, like the former rule, goes beyond the Act to apply to those teachers and would-be teachers who do or will offer
secondary school instruction in American government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., does not apply to this rule because it will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. Consequently, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
need not be performed. Section 610 of the Act provides for periodic review of rules which have or will have a significant
economic impact upon a substantial number of small businesses. In accordance with this provision, comments from
small entities concerning these rules will be considered. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq. in correspondence.

Sections 2400.11, 2400.21, 2400.53&hyph;54, and 2400.61&hyph;63 contain information collection requirements.
As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation has submitted
a copy of forms required under these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for its review (40 U.S.C. 3540(h)).
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on these information collection requirements should
direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503;

the number of credit hours determined by each university at which Fellows are studying as constituting a full year
of study at that university. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when
Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to
determine Fellows' total teaching obligations.

(c) If a master's degree program in which a Fellow is enrolled offers the option of a master's thesis in place of a course
or courses, the Fellow will be strongly urged to write a thesis. If the preparation of a master's thesis adds additional
required credits to the minimum number of credits required for the master's degree, the Foundation will pay for these
additional credits. In all programs in which a master's degree thesis is required or elected as an option, a Fellow
must write the thesis in a subject concerning the framing, principles, or history of the United States Constitution.

(a) Fellows may commence study under their fellowships as early as the summer following the announcement of their
award. Fellows are normally expected to commence study under their fellowships in the fall term of the academic year
following the date on which their award is announced. However, as indicated in &sect;2400.62 below, they may seek
to postpone the commencement of fellowship study under extenuating circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In determining the two- and five-year fellowship periods of Junior and Senior Fellows respectively, the Foundation
will consider the commencement of the fellowship period to be the date on which each Fellow commences study under a

Applicants for junior fellowships who seek or hold baccalaureate degrees in education are strongly encouraged to
pursue master's degrees in history or political science. Those applicants who hold undergraduate degrees in history,
political science, government, or any other subjects may take some teaching methods and related courses, although
the Foundation will not pay for them unless they are required for the degree for which the Fellow is matriculated. The
Foundation will review each proposed course of study for an appropriate balance of subject matter and other courses
based on the Fellow's goals, background, and degree requirements.

The Foundation may award senior fellowships to applicants who are seeking their second master's degrees providing
that the applicants' first master's degrees were obtained at least five years prior to the year in which the applicants
would normally commence study under a fellowship. In evaluating applications from those intending to pursue a second
master's degree, the Fellow Selection Committee will favor those applicants who are planning to become American
history and social studies teachers after having taught another subject and those whose initial master's degree
was in a subject different from that sought under the second master's degree.

Junior and senior fellowships carry a stipend of up to a maximum of $24,000 prorated over the period of Fellows' graduate
study. In no case shall the stipend for a fellowship exceed $12,000 per academic year. Within this limit, stipends
will be prorated over the period of Fellows' graduate study as follows: A maximum of $6,000 per academic semester or
trimester of full-time study, and a maximum of $4,000 per academic quarter of full-time study. Stipends for part-time
study will be pro rata shares of those allowable for full-time study.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Stipends shall be used only to offset the costs of tuition, fees, books, room, and board associated with graduate study
under a fellowship. The costs allowed for a Fellow's room and board will be the amount the Fellow's university reports
to the Foundation as the cost of room and board for a graduate student if that student were to share a room at the student's
university. If no graduate housing exists, then costs for regular shared student housing will be used. If no campus
housing exists, the equivalent room and board costs at neighboring universities will be used. Stipends for room,
board, and books will be prorated for Fellows enrolled in programs less than full time. The Foundation will not reimburse
Fellows for any portion of their master's degree study, if any, that Fellows may have completed prior to the commencement
of their fellowships. Nor will the Foundation reimburse Fellows for any credits acquired above the minimum number
of credits required for the degree. If a Fellow already taken and paid for courses that can be credited toward the Fellow's
graduate degree under a fellowship, those must be credited to the degree; the remaining required courses will be paid
for by the Foundation.

will fellowship funds be paid to Fellows to provide support in excess of their actual total costs of tuition, required
fees, books, room, and board. The Foundation may also reduce a Fellow's stipend if the Fellow is remunerated for the
costs of tuition under a research or teaching assistantship or a work-study program. In such a case, the Foundation
will require information from a Fellow's university about the intended use of assistantship or work-study support
before remitting fellowship payments.

Renewal of awards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Provided that Fellows have submitted all required documentation, it is the intent of the Foundation to renew junior
fellowship awards annually for a period not to exceed two calendar years and senior fellowships for a period not to
exceed five calendar years (except when those periods have been altered because of changes in Fellows' programs of
studies as provided for in &sect;2400.65), or until a Fellow has completed all requirements for a master's degree,
whichever comes first. In no case, however, will the Foundation continue payments under a fellowship to a Fellow who
has reached the maximum payments under a fellowship as indicated in &sect;2400.50, or completed the minimum number
of credits required for the degree. Although Fellows are encouraged to take courses in addition to those required
for the degree or required to maintain full-time status, the Foundation will not in such cases pay for those additional
courses unless they are credited to the minimum number of credits required for the degree.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Fellowship renewal will be subject to an annual review by the Foundation and certification by an authorized official
of the university at which a Fellow is registered that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) As a condition of renewal of awards, each Fellow must submit an annual activity report to the Foundation by July
15th. That report must indicate, through submission of a copy of the Fellow's transcript, courses taken and grades
achieved; courses planned for the coming year; changes in academic or professional plans or situations; any awards,
recognitions, or special achievements in the Fellow's academic study or school employment; and such other information
as may relate to the fellowship and its holder. Fellows must also submit a final report to the Foundation following

support practice teaching required for professional certification or other courses related to teaching unless
those courses are required for the degree. In those cases, however, the Foundation will provide reimbursement only
toward those courses related to teaching that fall within the minimum number of courses required for the degree, not
in addition to that minimum.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Institute is accredited for six graduate credits by the university at which it is held. It is expected that the universities
at which Fellows are pursuing their graduate study will, upon Fellows' satisfactory completion of the Institute,
accept these credits upon transfer from the university at which the Institute is held in fulfillment of the minimum
number of credits required for Fellows' graduate degrees. Satisfactory completion of the Institute will fulfill
six of the Foundation's 12 credits of required graduate study of the history and development of the Constitution.
Fellows, with the Foundation's assistance, are strongly encouraged to make good faith efforts to have their universities
incorporate the Institute into their course programs and accept the 6 Institute credits toward the minimum number
of credits required for their master's degrees.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Maritime Commission proposes to amend its regulations governing financial reporting requirements
and rate of return methodology applicable to vessel-operating common carriers by water in the domestic offshore
trades to discontinue use of the comparable earnings test in determining the reasonableness of a carrier's return
on rate base. In its place, the Commission proposes to use the weighted average cost of capital methodology. In addition,
the Commission proposes to amend its rules pertaining to the treatment of insurance expenses, accumulated deferred
taxes and the Capital Construction Fund for purposes of calculating a carrier's rate base. The proposed rule addresses
a number of shipper and carrier concerns regarding the Commission's current rate of return methodology and would
align the Commission's ratemaking methodologies more closely with those used by numerous other regulatory agencies.
The intent is to improve the Commission's methodology for evaluating the reasonableness of rates filed by carriers
in the domestic offshore trades and for acquiring the data that are essential to that evaluation.

 On March 11, 1993, the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'' or ``Commission'') published a final rule in Docket No.
91&hyph;51, Financial Reports of Common Carriers by Water in the Domestic Offshore Trades, which amended the provisions
under which carriers could obtain waivers of certain financial reporting requirements. 58 FR 13414. (1993) (``Docket
No. 91&hyph;51''). The Commission stated that it intended ``*&blank;*&blank;* to turn its attention, separately,
to the numerous other substantive changes to 46 CFR part 552 that have been suggested in this proceeding.'' Id. at 13417.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the Commission conducted an extensive review of part 552 to assess the need for changes to its financial
reporting requirements and rate of return methodology in the domestic offshore trades.

In its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued in Docket No. 91&hyph;51, 56 FR 57298, the Commission had solicited
comments and information from the public on issues which could be addressed in a proposed rule concerning substantive
guidelines for determining what constitutes a just and reasonable rate of return or profit for common carriers by
water in the domestic offshore trades.

I. The Allowable Rate of Return Should Equal the Cost of Capital
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fundamental objective when using a rate of return on rate base method of regulation is to set a regulated firm's
maximum allowable rate of return on rate base equal to the regulated firm's cost of capital. The cost of capital, sometimes
referred to by economists as ``the opportunity cost of capital'' or ``the required rate of return,'' is the minimum
rate of return necessary to attract capital to an investment. It is the expected rate of return prevailing in capital
markets on alternative investments of equivalent risk.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The bases for setting the allowable rate of return equal to the cost of capital are legal and economic.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Legal Rationale
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two landmark Supreme Court cases defined the legal principles underlying rate of return regulation and provided
the notion of a fair rate of return. The two cases, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
262 U.S. 679 (1923) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Power Commission 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hope Natural Gas Company, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
320 U.S. 391 (1944), established that investors in companies subject to rate regulation must be allowed an opportunity
to earn returns sufficient to attract capital and comparable to those they would expect from investments in other
firms for incurring the same amount of risk, and that revenues must not only cover operating expenses, but capital
costs as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Economic Rationale
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic rationale for setting the allowable rate of return of a regulated enterprise equal to its cost of capital
is that the regulated firm's customers will thereby pay the lowest cost for service in the long run.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if a regulator sets the allowable rate of return above the cost of capital, the firm's stockholders will
realize earnings in excess of those they could earn on alternative investments of comparable risk. Such excess earnings
are paid for by the firm's customers in the form of prices higher than those that they would otherwise be required to
pay. If, on the other hand, a regulator sets the allowable rate of return below the cost of capital, stockholders will
realize earnings less than they could on alternative investments of comparable risk. In the short run, the firm's
customers may benefit because they pay prices lower than those they would otherwise be required to pay. In the long
run, however, the firm's stockholders will be unwilling to continue to invest their funds, and the firm will, therefore,
lack the requisite financial capital for maintaining and augmenting the firm's physical plant and equipment. Customers,
in turn, will be supplied with a lesser quantity and/or quality of service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Setting the allowable rate of return equal to the cost of capital also ensures that society's supply of capital is used
most productively. Because capital markets are considered to be highly competitive, the cost of new capital is an
accurate gauge of that capital's value in alternative uses. When the allowable rate of return is greater than the cost
of capital, investors will supply too much capital to a regulated firm, thereby diverting capital from alternative
investments where it could be more productive. Conversely, when the allowable rate of return is less than the cost
of capital, investors will supply too little capital to a regulated firm, thereby allocating funds to less productive
investments. Such a misallocation of resources represents a welfare loss for society as a whole.

C. Methodologies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission uses a version of the Comparable Earnings Test (``CET'') to determine the reasonableness of rates
of return. The carrier's projected rate of return ((net income after taxes + interest expense)/rate base
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
) is compared with the rate of return on total capital earned by U.S. manufacturing firms over an extended period of
time_the benchmark rate of return. Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the benchmark for current trends in
rates of return, the cost of money and relative risk.

Rate base is a carrier's investment in Commission-regulated activities. It consists of investments in vessels less
accumulated depreciation, other property and equipment less accumulated depreciation, and working capital.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, most regulatory agencies use the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (``WACC'') methodology to set allowable
rates of return, including, for example the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission
(``ICC''), the Federal Communications Commission, and the Maryland Public Service Commission. Indeed, the most
recent yearbook published by the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners shows that virtually every state
regulatory commission in the U.S. uses some variation of the WACC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Further, current economic literature recognizes the WACC approach as the most generally accepted method of setting
allowable rates of return.

The WACC approach recognizes that there are several methods by which a firm may raise capital and each has its attendant
cost. Typically, the total capital of a firm has come from three different sources, long-term debt, preferred stock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and common-stock equity. Thus, the total capital of a firm may have a debt component, a preferred stock component and
a common-stock equity component. Under the WACC methodology,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the cost of each of these components is calculated separately and weighted by the proportion the component is to the
total capital of the firm.

To illustrate the calculation of the WACC, consider a hypothetical regulated company that has total invested capital
of $100 million, consisting of $25 million of long-term debt, $15 millon of preferred stock, and $60 million of common-stock
equity. Assume that the firm's cost of long-term debt is 7 percent, cost of preferred stock is 9 percent, and cost of
common-stock equity is 12 percent. Further, assume that the firm operates in a world where corporate taxes do not exist.
The WACC for this firm is calculated as follows:

Thus, given the assumptions of this example, the WACC is 10.30 percent. The allowable rate of return for this hypothetical
company should, therefore, be set at 10.30 percent, which would provide the firm with the opportunity to earn revenues
sufficient to service the company's overall cost of capital.

 In reality, a regulated firm typically does pay taxes, and the WACC must be adjusted to arrive at a final number for an
allowable rate of return. Such adjustment is made by calculating the WACC on a before-tax basis (``BTWACC''). The
BTWACC is described in detail later.

The costs of long-term debt and preferred stock capital may be calculated with relative precision. For the debt component,
this is done by computing the actual total annual fixed charges on long-term debt for all issues, including any amortized
discount or premium and issuance expense. The total annual fixed charges are then divided by the actual total value
of long-term debt outstanding for all issues in order to arrive at the cost of debt stated as a percentage. For example,
if the annual fixed charges on long-term debt are $1,750,000 and the total long-term debt outstanding is $25 million,
the cost of debt would be 7 percent ($1,750,000/$25 million=.07). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of preferred stock is calculated in similar fashion. The actual total annual dividend requirements on the
preferred stock for all issues is divided by the actual total value of preferred stock outstanding for all issues in
order to arrive at the cost of preferred stock stated as a percentage. For example, if the actual total annual dividend
requirements amounted to $1,350,000 and the total value of outstanding preferred stock is $15 million, the cost of
preferred stock would be 9 percent ($1,350,000/$15 million=.09). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculation of the cost of common stock equity capital, the third component of the WACC, is more difficult. Commonly
used methods are the Discounted Cash Flow (``DCF''), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (``CAPM'') and the Risk Premium
(``RP''). Each of these models is based on market variables (e.g., stock market prices and bond yields) which reflect
the expectations of investors in capital markets. More specifically, the DCF, CAPM and RP models are constructed
under the generally accepted assumption that a company's stock market price at any moment in time reflects completely
investors' current expectations. Because these market-based models are designed to reflect the expectations of
investors, and because a company's cost of capital is defined as the rate of return expected by investors on alternative
investments of equivalent risk, the WACC framework implemented through the use of such models will, in general, equate
the allowable rate of return with the cost of capital.

The accounting rate of return for a company is not equivalent to the firm's true economic rate of return because accounting
and economic concepts of income and value are substantially different. Accounting numbers are derived on the basis
of generally accepted accounting principles while economics specifies the use of opportunity costs. This difference
is particularly acute when the economy is characterized by high and variable rates of inflation. For example, accountants
define asset values in terms of acquisition or historical costs while economists define asset values on the basis
of market values or replacement costs. This distinction effects both the income statement as well as the balance sheet.
Consequently, an accounting-based rate of return methodology such as the Commission's CET does not adequately measure
a regulated carrier's true cost of capital. In Docket No. 91&hyph;51, the State of Hawaii noted the problems associated
with using accounting data and criticized the Commission's CET for being accounting-based and not market-based.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several empirical tests have demonstrated that there is a large discrepancy between accounting rate of return and
true economic return.

 These studies also demonstrate that biases inherent in book returns are systematic, and that these biases do not cancel
out by averaging across companies. Furthermore, the type and magnitude of bias for regulated firms are different
than those of unregulated firms contained in the comparable risk group of firms selected in applying the Commission's
CET method.

 Regulators (including the FMC) commonly set rates on the basis of a book value rate base. In such instances, the economic
(i.e., market) value of a regulated firm will tend to be closer to its book value in comparison to the economic values
and book values of the unregulated firms contained in the proxy group. The book returns of the unregulated firms are,
therefore, likely to be substantially more biased than those of the regulated firm under consideration.

B. Practical Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WACC approach also presents some important technical advantages. First, the WACC uses the actual long-term interest
expense currently provided by a regulated carrier to compute the company's cost of long-term debt capital, while
the Commission's CET uses an estimate of a carrier's long-term interest expense based on moving averages of Baa-rated
corporate bond yields in computing an allowable rate of return on rate base. By definition, a firm's actual long-term
interest expense is more accurate than an estimate of that expense. In its comments in Docket No. 91&hyph;51, the State
of Hawaii stated that the Commission's CET introduces imprecision into the calculation by requiring that parties
substitute a proxy for carrier interest expense as a component of the carrier's rate of return, although this component
is known and subject to verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the WACC, when implemented properly, ensures that the regulated carrier will be allowed a return on rate base
that is large enough to ensure that the carrier will have the opportunity to earn, at a minimum, revenues that are sufficient
to cover its embedded (actual historical) cost of debt. Assuming that debt capital financing is less expensive than
preferred stock and common-stock equity capital financing, when the known cost of long-term debt is weighted by the
regulated company's proportion of long-term debt capital outstanding, and then added to the firm's cost of preferred
stock weighted by the firm's proportion of preferred stock capital outstanding and the firm's cost of common-stock
equity capital weighted by the firm's proportion of common-stock equity capital outstanding, the resulting sum
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the WACC) can be no less than the cost of the firm's embedded cost of debt. Such a guarantee is not available under the
Commission's CET, as Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (``Matson''), has pointed out. For example, if the long-term
interest expense estimate, derived on the basis of a moving average of historical Baa corporate bond yields, is not
representative of the actual long-term interest expense of the regulated carrier, or if the historical financial
data reflecting the financial picture of the benchmark group of firms are not representative of the regulated carrier's
financial position, then the regulated carrier's calculated allowable rate of return on rate base could fall short
of its embedded cost of debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Commission's CET has proved difficult to apply in the case of the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority
(``PRMSA''), which has a capital structure composed entirely of long-term debt and by law is not required to pay taxes.
On the other hand, the WACC can be used effectively to establish an appropriate allowable rate of return for such a carrier.
The WACC is computed for such a carrier by weighting the cost of long-term debt near or equal to one, the cost of preferred
stock near or equal to zero, and the cost of common-stock equity near or equal to zero, and setting the corporate tax
rate equal to zero. The WACC can be used effectively to compute an accurate estimate of the overall cost of capital and,
in turn, to establish an appropriate allowable rate of return for a regulated carrier that is financed exclusively
or almost completely by long-term debt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and is tax-exempt, because it distinguishes between such a carrier and one that is financed with substantial amounts
of common-stock equity and is not tax-exempt. In its comments in Docket No. 91&hyph;51, PRMSA observed that the Commission's
CET makes no such distinction because it uses as a benchmark for every regulated carrier, regardless of actual capital
structure or tax status, a typical firm financed with a relatively balanced mixture of long-term debt and common-stock
equity capital, and is not tax-exempt.

A profitable firm will generally have at least some amount of common-stock equity capital in its capital structure
because such a firm will usually have an internal source of such capital in the form of retained earnings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the WACC method typically uses a number of different methods to calculate the regulated firm's cost of common-stock
equity capital. This yields several different estimates of the firm's WACC providing a regulatory commission with
a range of numbers from which a single number representing an allowable rate of return on rate base can be chosen. This
minimizes the possibility that the allowable rate of return will be distorted by inappropriate subjective judgements
or by extraordinary economic conditions existing during the time period used to measure that return. By comparison,
the Commission's CET produces a single measure of an allowable rate of return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of its review, the Commission has determined to propose the use of the WACC methodology to evaluate the
reasonableness of a carrier's rates in the domestic offshore trades. The Commission believes that the WACC approach
set forth in the proposed rule represents a substantial improvement over the existing methodology and addresses
the criticisms voiced in comments in Docket No. 91&hyph;51. We now turn to the proposed rule.

A. Capital Structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first step in calculating the WACC is to determine an appropriate capital structure (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the proportions of long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capital issued by a firm to finance
its operations) for the regulated firm. There are two important issues that may have to be resolved. The first is whether
to calculate the WACC using a ``typical'' or ``ideal'' capital structure as some regulatory commissions do, or the
actual capital structure or that expected in the near future, as others do. The second issue concerns the situation
where the regulated company is a subsidiary of a parent company. The issue is whether to use the capital structure of
the subsidiary or that of the consolidated system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the WACC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypothetical Versus Actual Capital Structure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The WACC may be much lower when the proportion of debt contained in a company's capital structure is relatively high
compared to common-stock equity. This is because the interest rate on debt is usually much lower than the cost of common-stock
equity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, debt costs the firm and the ratepayer less than equity because equity earnings are subject to income taxes
and debt is not. The revenue that a company is allowed to earn on its common-stock equity is increased by amounts added
to that revenue for the purpose of paying income taxes. By contrast, since interest is deductible for income tax purposes,
earnings to cover debt costs are computed before any income tax calculations, and are not subject to income tax. Consequently,
within limits determined by such factors as the risk of a business, the WACC may be lower and ratepayers may pay less
when the firm employs a relatively large proportion of debt than when it uses a relatively large proportion of equity.
Given this differential, some regulatory commissions compute the WACC using what they believe to be the ``typical,''
or ``ideal,'' capital structure without regard to the actual capitalization of the regulated company in question.
Other regulatory commissions base their WACC estimates on either the actual capital structure, or that expected
in the near future when rates to be decided will be in effect.

There are two reasons for this: (1) debtholders have priority over equityholders as to the remaining assets of the
firm in the event that the firm is liquidated; and (2) debtholders must be paid their contractual level of interest
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, their coupon payment) before equityholders receive any compensation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, dividend payments). A company may reduce or eliminate dividend payments to equityholders in the event that it is
under financial strain. However, it is far less likely that coupon payments will be eliminated because this could
result in bankruptcy if the firm does not take corrective action. Equityholders, therefore, require a higher return
than do debtholders. Consequently, it costs a firm more to issue common-stock equity than it does to issue debt. The
more expensive common-stock equity financing could be borne by ratepayers in the form of higher rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are strong reasons for using a regulated carrier's actual or expected capital structure rather than the alternative
of a hypothetical or ideal capital structure in calculating the carrier's WACC. First, a regulated company's current
capital structure could be the product of decisions that were logical and efficient at the time they were made, although
a different capitalization might be consistent with a lower WACC at the time of a rate investigation and hearing. Although
hindsight is always more accurate than foresight, a company must make financial decisions based on an evaluation
of the present and projections of future conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule specifies the use of a regulated domestic offshore carrier's expected
capital structure in computing the carrier's WACC. The proposed rule stipulates the use of the expected rather than
the actual capital structure because the Commission uses a future instead of a historic test year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Subsidiary Versus Consolidated Capital Structure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where a regulated company is a wholly owned subsidiary which obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent
company, regulators often use the capital structure of the consolidated system (i.e., the parent company and all
of its subsidiaries) in computing the WACC. The consolidated capital structure is an appropriate capitalization
to use in calculating a regulated subsidiary's WACC when: (1) No substantial minority interest in the subsidiary
exists (i.e., the regulated subsidiary is wholly-owned by a parent company or nearly so), and (2) the risks are similar
between the parent and subsidiary.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 In such a situation, investors' appraisals of the parent company's common stock are thought to represent the best
measure of the current cost of common-stock equity to the subsidiary.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital
(issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of preferred stock, and the consolidated system's
cost of long-term debt, rather than the respective capital component costs of the regulated subsidiary, are also
used because the consolidated capital structure directly affects the capital component costs of the consolidated
system and not those of the subsidiary.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The use of the regulated subsidiary's capital component costs is inconsistent with the use of the consolidated system's
capital structure and could, therefore, distort the WACC estimate obtained for the regulated subsidiary.

The use of the consolidated capital structure differs from the ``double leverage'' concept used by some expert witnesses.
The latter approach uses the parent company's WACC as a measure of the subsidiary's cost of common-stock equity capital
along with the subsidiary's capital structure, the subsidiary's cost of preferred stock, and the subsidiary's cost
of debt. Those that favor the use of such a method cite the advantage of using the actual data of the subsidiary for which
an allowable rate of return is being computed. The merits of the approach are highly debatable, however, since it could
produce an estimate of the cost of common-stock equity capital for the regulated subsidiary that is lower than the
opportunity cost of such capital when the subsidiary is more risky than the parent, and an estimate that is higher when
the subsidiary is less risky. The Commission's proposed rule does not, therefore, rely on the double leverage method
of calculating the WACC for a regulated subsidiary company.

To see how a company's capital structure could affect its component capital costs, consider, for example, the case
of a heavily-leveraged company (i.e., one that has a relatively large proportion of debt in its capital structure).
Such a company could be perceived by current and potential debtholders and equityholders as having a relatively high
probability of bankruptcy (in which case coupon and dividend payments would be discontinued and the possibility
that principal could also be lost would be heightened) and, therefore, as being a relatively high risk investment.
Debtholders and equityholders would require a return on their investment funds that is commensurate with the relatively
high risk of such a company in order for them to be willing to purchase and hold the company's debt and common stock. A
heavily leveraged firm could, therefore, have relatively high costs of debt and common-stock equity capital.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of the consolidated capital structure is not correct, however, when a substantial minority interest in the
regulated subsidiary exists, or when the regulated subsidiary's risk differs substantially from that of the parent
company. The appropriate approach in this situation is to ignore the parent-subsidiary relationship and to estimate
the subsidiary's WACC using the subsidiary's own capital structure and capital component costs. This method, referred
to as the ``stand alone'' or ``subsidiary approach,'' recognizes the subsidiary as an independent operating company,
and its cost of common-stock equity capital is inferred as the cost of common-stock equity of firms having risk comparable
to that of the subsidiary.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The basis for this method is that the required return on an investment depends on its risk (i.e., the subsidiary's risk)
rather than on the parent's financing costs. In short, this method emphasizes the use, rather than the source, of the
subsidiary's capital funds.

The Commission's proposed rule specifies that a subsidiary carrier's capital structure is to be used in computing
the WACC unless, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission determines that: (1) The subsidiary carrier's
parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity; (2) no substantial minority interest in the subsidiary
carrier exists; and (3) risks are similar between the subsidiary carrier and the parent company. Under the proposed
rule, no substantial minority interest in a subsidiary carrier exists when a parent company owns 90 percent or more
of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock. It also must be demonstrated that both the business and the financial risks
facing the parent and subsidiary are similar.

 There must also be an assessment of the degree to which the regulated subsidiary comprises the parent's holdings.
To the extent that a subsidiary accounts for a substantial majority of the consolidated system's revenues, expenses,
and profits, the business risks of the parent and subsidiary would, in general, be the same. However, where a parent's
holdings are diversified into areas of business unrelated to the regulated subsidiary, the business risks of the
parent and of the subsidiary are more likely to differ.

The fixed charges coverage ratio (``FCCR'') measures the ability of a firm to satisfy all of its fixed obligations.
FCCR is computed by dividing the total of net income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and

Book Value Versus Market Value Capitalization Ratios
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Another capital structure issue is whether to use market or book values in computing the capitalization ratios (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the weights) in the WACC formula. Technically, capitalization ratios should be computed on the basis of market value.
A capital structure computed on the basis of historical (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, book values) as opposed to current market values misrepresents the true capital structure over time, since price
levels fluctuate. The common practice is, nevertheless, to compute capitalization ratios on the basis of book values.
This is defended on grounds that a regulated firm supposedly raises capital in such a fashion that a target capitalization
ratio expressed on the basis of book values is maintained by the company. Consequently, regulators must compute the
firm's overall cost of capital on the same basis in order to ensure that the company's capital costs are adequately
covered. In addition, book value capitalization ratios are stable and the regulator is, therefore, not required
to deal with the uncertainties associated with volatile market weights. Further, effective regulation is said to
force book and market values toward equality. Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule requires the use of book
value capitalization ratios in computing the WACC.

Average Versus Year-End Capital Structure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Finally, there is the issue of whether a year-end or average capital structure should be used in computing the WACC.
The fact that financial variables and ratios are commonly stated on an average basis argues in favor of using an expected
average capital structure projected over a future test year, rather than a year-end capital structure. Earnings
per share, for example, are typically expressed on the basis of average number of shares outstanding. Equity returns
are also frequently expressed on the basis of average common-stock equity. In addition, an average capital structure
computed over a future test year is likely to represent the company's capital structure during the time interval in
which a proposed general rate increase will be in effect better than a year-end capital structure, because the company
could acquire new capital from, or return existing capital to, investors during that period of time. The use of an average
capital structure rather than a year-end capital structure is, therefore, more likely to enable a regulated firm
to actually earn its allowable rate of return. Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule specifies the use of test-year
average
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 book value capitalization ratios in computing the WACC.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Such average ratios are computed using the average amount of each capital component (expected to be) outstanding
during the test year. The average test year amount outstanding for any class of capital is computed by adding the amount
of a particular type of capital (expected to be) outstanding at the beginning of the test year to the amount of that same
type of capital (expected to be) outstanding at the end of the test year, and dividing the sum of the two amounts outstanding
by two.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost of Senior Capital.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are usually few problems encountered in computing the cost of senior capital with precision. Regulatory commissions
traditionally compute cost of senior capital on the basis of embedded (actual historical) cost. This is done by first
computing the actual total annual fixed charges on long-term debt, including any amortized discount or premium and
issuance expense, and the actual total annual dividend requirements on the preferred (and preference) stock for
all issues on a dollar basis. These dollar figures are then converted to a percentage by dividing the actual total annual
fixed charges on long-term debt by the actual total value of long-term debt outstanding, and the actual total annual
preferred stock dividend requirements by the actual total value of preferred stock outstanding for all issues. If
a future (rather than a historical) test year is used (as the FMC does), the cost of senior capital is calculated on the
basis of: (1) The embedded cost for the existing long-term debt and preferred stock, and (2) the current cost for any
new long-term debt and preferred stock that the regulated firm anticipates issuing on or before the final day of the
projected test year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The embedded cost is used to calculate the cost of existing senior capital in order to determine what the senior capital
will cost the firm today, in view of the fact that the majority of it was issued at prior points in time, and under bond
and stock market conditions that could have differed substantially compared to those prevailing today. The objective
is not to determine what the existing senior capital would cost if issued today. Rather, the embedded debt cost measures
precisely what the regulated firm needs to satisfy its contractually required interest payments to those holding
existing long-term debt, and preferred-dividend payments to those holding existing preferred stock. The current
cost of bonds and preferred stock is, therefore, estimated only to measure the cost to the regulated firm when such
senior securities are to be issued in the near future.

Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The most critical problem in determining the WACC is that of estimating the cost of common-stock equity capital. The
objective is to determine how much the regulated firm is required to earn in order to be able to entice investors into
purchasing and holding its common-stock equity. A precise answer to this question is difficult to arrive at due to
the absence of any expressed or fixed agreement as to the level of dividends that are to be paid by the regulated firm
to its common-stock equityholders. Dividend payments, on the one hand, depend upon the profits of the regulated company.
The allowable amount of profits, on the other hand, is the object of a rate investigation and hearing. A regulator,
in allowing a fair rate of return, does not, therefore, have any predetermined gauge as to the level of profit and common-stock
equity dividends required by investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are five major methods used to estimate the cost of common-stock equity capital: DCF, RP, CAPM,

a. Discounted Cash Flow Method. The DCF method of estimating the cost of common-stock equity is the technique that
is used with the greatest frequency by state and federal regulatory commissions and agencies. Its popularity reflects
the intuitive appeal of the DCF model with its basis in valuation theory. That theory holds that the current market
price of a common stock is equal to the present value of its expected future dividend payments plus the proceeds that
an investor would expect to receive when the common stock is finally sold. Because the value of an amount of money to
be received in the future is less than the value of the same amount of money received today,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the expected value of the future dividends and ultimate proceeds must be discounted back to the present at the investor's
required rate of return in computing the present value of a common stock. The most basic mathematical representation
of this concept assumes that: (1) Dividends grow at a constant annual rate, and (2) that an investor will hold the common
stock forever. The latter assumption implies that the value of the stock depends solely on the dividends that are expected
to be paid. The basic DCF model is expressed algebraically as follows:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Expected Growth Rate of Dividends. The major practical issue involves determining ``g,'' the constant expected
annual rate of growth in dividends per share. There are three techniques that are commonly used to estimate ``g'':
(1) Historical growth rates; (2) professional investment services' projections; and (3) sustainable growth or
retention growth. An average of the growth rates arrived at separately using each of the three methods is often used
to produce a final growth estimate. This averaging procedure is the one reflected in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Historical Growth Rate. The historical growth rate in dividends over some period, frequently five or ten years,
is one method used to estimate ``g.'' Historical data are used because investors' expectations of future growth are
based in part on growth rates experienced in the past. The historical growth in earnings per share, or book value per
share, is sometimes used as a proxy for the growth in dividends, because dividends are often increased at discrete
intervals, so that their estimated growth rate can differ considerably depending upon the precise beginning and
ending points of the selected data series. The proposed rule, therefore, requires averaging the historical growth
rate of dividends per share, earnings per share, and book value per share in arriving at an estimate of ``g.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period over which ``g'' is to be measured must be sufficiently long to avoid distortions in the data resulting from
short-term conditions and aberrational years, but sufficiently short to capture foreseeable influences relevant
for investors' evaluation of the future. The most recent five- and ten-year periods are commonly used to calculate
the growth rate. The proposed rule uses an average of the five- and ten-year growth rates on the basis that the average
represents a reasonable trade-off between the incongruous requirements of representativity and statistical adequacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Professional Investment Services' Projections. The expected growth rate of dividends is also commonly based
upon the growth rates published by professional investment services, since investor expectations are the desired
quantities in the DCF model, and investors' growth anticipations are based in part upon the projections of such services.
Growth forecasts of dividends per share, earnings per share, and book value per share are published by several services,
including Value Line Publishing, Inc. (``Value Line''), and the Institutional Brokers Estimation Service (``IBES'').
Such growth rates are published on a regular basis, usually for five-year periods, and are readily available to investors.
Expert witnesses usually develop a consensus forecast by averaging the forecasts of the professional analysts,
and use this average in calculating ``g.'' The Commission's proposed rule similarly specifies that ``g'' will be
measured by using the average of: (1) The five-year dividend, earnings, and book value forecasts published by Value
Line, and of (2) the five-year earnings forecast published by IBES.

(iii) The Sustainable Growth Rate. The third technique used to estimate ``g,'' known alternately as the ``sustainable
growth,'' ``retention ratio,'' or ``plowback'' method, is to multiply the proportion of earnings expected to be
retained by the company, ``b,'' by the expected return on book equity, ROE. The relationship is expressed algebraically
as g=(b)(ROE). The theoretical underpinning for the method is that future growth in dividends for existing equity
can only occur if a portion of the overall return to investors is plowed back into the firm rather than being paid out
as dividends.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To illustrate the sustainable growth rate method, assume that a hypothetical regulated company is expected to retain
75 percent of its earnings, and is expected to earn a 10 percent return on book equity. The company's sustainable growth
rate estimate of ``g'' is:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
g=.75(.10)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
=.075 or 7.5 percent.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both historical and projected values of ``b'' and ROE are used to estimate ``g.'' Projected values are regarded as
superior, however, since forecasted values incorporate current and predicted changes into the values. In addition,
the use of historical realized book returns on equity in estimating ROE has been criticized because the realized returns
are the product of the regulatory process itself, and are also subject to tests of reasonableness. Therefore, the
Commission's proposed rule requires that the forecasted values of ``b'' and ROE published by Value Line be used in
implementing the sustainable growth method.

(iv) Final Estimate of ``g''. The final estimate of ``g'' for the DCF model is commonly based on an average of the separate
estimates arrived at using the historical data, the professional investment services' projections, and the sustainable
growth model. Thus, the Commission's proposed rule reflects such an averaging procedure.

(b) Dividend Yield. Two methods are commonly used to calculate dividend yields in DCF analyses. The standard DCF model
uses the annual dividend expected to be paid 12 months following the purchase of the security. This method assumes
that dividends are paid annually. The other method uses the current dividend to compute the yield portion of the annual
return. This method assumes that dividends are paid continuously. However, the assumption of annual payments results
in an overstatement of the required return (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital), and the assumption of continuous payments results in
an understatement of the required return. Since most firms pay dividends on a quarterly basis, however, it is proper
to use a method that recognizes such quarterly installments. Such a method applies an adjustment factor to the current
dividend yield to account for quarterly payment of dividends. The dividend yield, assuming quarterly payment of
dividends, is calculated on the basis of the following formula:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calculating the current price per share found in the denominator of the expression for the dividend yield, an average
price over a period of time, rather than a price on a particular day, is often used in order to remove aberrations from
the calculation. Such aberrations could be the result of events internal to the company (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the stock may go ex-dividend
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or external factors (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 political events that affect the price of a firm's stock). The period over which to average the price of the common stock
should be sufficiently long to remove the aberration, but sufficiently short so as not to obscure any real trends in
the stock market. The Commission believes that the use of an average of the monthly high and low prices for a six-month
period in computing the dividend yield meets these criteria, and such an average is, therefore, reflected in the proposed
rule.

Ex-dividend is the interval between the announcement and the payment of the next dividend. An investor who buys shares
during that interval is not entitled to that dividend. Typically, a stock's price moves up by the dollar amount of the
dividend as the ex-dividend date approaches, then falls by the amount of the dividend after that date.

(c) Company-Specific Versus Comparable Group DCF Approach. The DCF model can be applied directly to a regulated company
which issues publicly-traded common-stock equity (so that the requisite stock market price data for doing so exist),
to a group of companies comparable in risk to the subject carrier which issue publicly-traded common-stock equity,
or, where possible, both. The company-specific DCF approach provides the stock market's most direct and meaningful
measure of a company's cost of common-stock equity capital. Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule requires
that the DCF model be applied directly to the subject carrier where the carrier issues common-stock equity which trades
publicly.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Only where a carrier issues no publicly-traded common-stock equity is the DCF model to be applied to a comparable group
of firms under the proposed rule. Some expert witnesses do, however, apply the DCF model to a comparable group of firms,
even where direct stock market data are available, either in place of, or in addition to, the company-specific DCF
approach. The Commission's proposed rule does not prescribe the comparable group DCF approach where direct stock
market price data are available because it is not certain that this approach would improve upon the accuracy of the
cost of common-stock equity capital estimate obtained using the carrier-specific DCF approach.

Alternatively, under the proposed rule, the DCF model is to be applied directly to the parent company of a subsidiary
carrier where a consolidated capital structure and consolidated system capital component costs are to be used to
calculate the WACC, assuming that the parent company issues common-stock equity which trades publicly.

b. Capital Asset Pricing Model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conceptual basis of the CAPM is that investors hold diversified portfolios consisting of individual common stocks
to minimize risk. Diversification reduces the risk of the portfolio because individual common stock rates of return
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are not perfectly correlated. The rate of return on some common stocks tends to be high while on others it tends to be
low so that the average risk or variability of the return of the portfolio is less than the average risk of the returns
of the common stocks contained in that portfolio. Diversification does not completely eliminate risk, however,
since individual common stock returns are correlated to a certain degree due to the influence of pervasive forces
not specific to a particular security that affect the overall market.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual rate of return on a common stock is the sum of two components: (1) The annual dividend yield, which is annual
dividend income divided by the price of the common stock at the beginning of a given year; and (2) the annual capital
appreciation or depreciation, which is the annual increase or decrease in the price of the common stock, divided by
the price at the beginning of the given year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total risk of a common stock is partitioned into two components: (1) The ``specific'' or ``unsystematic'' risk
unique to a company that can be diversified away in a well-constructed portfolio, and (2) the ``market'' or ``systematic''
risk that cannot be diversified away. The core idea of the CAPM is that because investors can diversify away company-specific
risk, they should not be rewarded for bearing this superfluous risk. Diversified risk-averse investors are exposed
solely to market risk and are, therefore, rewarded with higher expected returns for bearing higher market risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAPM provides a measure of market risk, known as ``beta,'' which gauges the degree to which an individual common
stock's return moves with the overall market's return. Specifically, the common stock's historical returns are
compared with the overall market's historical returns (commonly measured as the returns on a broad market index such
as the Standard and Poor's 500). A common stock is considered to be of above average risk if the stock's return is more
volatile than that of the market,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and of below average risk if the stock's return is less volatile than that of the market.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of an individual common stock.

The CAPM holds that the return on a common stock expected by an investor is equivalent to that which could be earned on
a riskless investment, plus a premium for assuming risk that is proportional to the common stock's market risk (i.e.,
``beta''), and the market price of risk (i.e., the difference between the overall expected stock market return and
the expected return on a risk-free investment). The CAPM is represented algebraically as follows:

i. Practical Issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practical application of the CAPM requires estimates of the expected ``beta'' of the regulated firm, the expected
risk-free rate, and the expected return on the stock market. Each of these inputs is discussed in turn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Risk-Free Rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The yield on a 90-day Treasury Bill is theoretically risk-free. It is devoid of default risk and is subject to little
interest rate risk. Treasury Bill rates vary widely, however, resulting in volatile and unreliable common-stock
equity return estimates. In addition, 90-day Treasury Bill rates generally do not match investors' planning horizons,
which typically are far in excess of 90 days. Short-term government obligations may also reflect the impact of factors
(e.g., inflation) differently than long-term securities such as common stocks, or may reflect different factors
than those influencing the long term securities. Long-term Treasury bonds (e.g., 30-year bonds) may more closely
approximate investors' planning horizons, and their yields usually match more closely with common stock returns.
The yields on long-term bonds are subject to substantial interest rate risk, however, and so are not truly risk-free.
A compromise is to use the yields on Treasury securities of intermediate maturities as proxies for the risk-free rate.
Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule implements the CAPM using a six-month average of five-year Treasury
Note yields.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) ``Beta.'' The value of ``beta'' used in applying the CAPM should, in principle, be that which is expected in the
future. The ``beta'' actually used in the practical application of the model is, however, more commonly calculated
on the basis of historical data. ``Beta'' could be calculated by applying regression analysis, using historical
price and dividend data for the regulated firm under consideration, in order to measure the variability of the return
on the regulated firm's common stock relative to that of the market. The usual practice, however, is to use the ``betas''
published by an investment firm such as Value Line. Value Line ``betas'' are derived from a regression analysis between
weekly percent changes in the price of a company's common stock and the weekly percent changes in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Indices over a period of five years.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Provided that the regulated firm's market risk is not expected to change appreciably in the future, ``betas'' based
on historical data are appropriate for estimating the cost of common-stock equity. Therefore, the Commission's
proposed rule specifies the use of Value Line's most current ``betas'' in implementing the CAPM.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Value Line publishes adjusted ``betas.'' The adjustment recognizes the tendency of ``betas'' to move toward one.
(The market index by definition has a value identically equal to one.) There are two justifications for making such
an adjustment: (1) Empirical studies demonstrate that ``betas'' tend to move toward one over time, and (2) the average
``beta'' is known to be one, and adjusting an estimated ``beta'' toward one is, therefore, an appropriate use of existing
information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Market Return. The third input required by the CAPM is an estimate of the expected return on the stock market. One
broad approach is to estimate the expected return on the market directly. One such technique is to apply a DCF analysis
to a broad market index such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. A second broad approach is the historically derived risk
premium method, which involves two steps: (1) The arithmetic average difference between the actual annual returns
realized in the past on the overall stock market and the risk-free rate is calculated,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
36
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (2) this historical differential is added to the currently prevailing yield on the risk-free security. The resulting
sum is a measure of the return on the market. The rationale for this method is that investors anticipate that common
stocks will yield a higher return than the return on lower risk, fixed income securities, and the additional return
on the common stocks is expected to be approximately equal to what it was in the past. The Commission's proposed rule
stipulates the use of the historically derived risk premium method because it is relatively easy to apply, and its
data requirements are relatively light compared to methods designed to measure the expected market return directly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The arithmetic mean, not the geometric mean, should be used, since the quantity desired is the rate of return investors
expect over the next year for the random annual rate of return on the market. The arithmetic mean is the unbiased measure
of the expected value of repeated observations of a random variable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The historical risk differential is commonly based on the historical return series published annually by Ibbotson
Associates in the Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation Yearbook (``SBBI Yearbook''). The SBBI Yearbook provides
averages of the historical risk differentials relative to various government securities for the period 1926 to the
present, using Standard and Poor's 500 Index to compute the overall market rate of return. The Commission's proposed
rule specifies the same source for measuring the arithmetic average risk premium relative to the required risk-free
rate proxy (i.e., the five-year Treasury Note).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of a time period for measuring the historical differential sometimes differs, but frequently it matches
the entire period over which Ibbotson Associates provides the data. Returns calculated over a substantially shorter
horizon (e.g., five or ten years) are sometimes used to calculate the risk premium. This is not appropriate, however,
due to the extreme volatility of the return on the overall stock market.

In statistical terms, this extreme variability implies an extremely large standard deviation over any short period
of time. Estimates of the overall market return calculated over such a short period of time are, therefore, unreliable.

In summary, the proposed rule requires that the market return used in CAPM calculations be computed using a risk premium
defined as the arithmetic average historical risk differential relative to the five-year Treasury Note using the
data published in the most current SBBI Yearbook for the period 1926 through the most recent date for which the data
are available.

c. Risk Premium Method. The RP method, alternately referred to as the ``risk positioning method'' or the ``stock-bond
yield spread method,'' is based upon the premise that common-stock equity capital is riskier than debt from an investors'
perspective and that investors, therefore, require a larger rate of return on investments in common stocks than on
bonds to compensate them for bearing the extra risk. Common stock equity is riskier than debt because the payment of
interest and principal to debtholders has priority over the payment of dividends and return of capital to common-stock
equityholders. The RP method, therefore, estimates the cost of capital by adding an explicit premium for risk to a
current interest rate, frequently an interest rate on a particular government security. The general mathematical
expression for the RP model is as follows:

i. Practical Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Risk Premium. There are several procedures for estimating the risk premium. One common approach is to use the historical
arithmetic average return differential between rates of return actually earned on investments in common-stock
equities and bonds. This approach is expressed mathematically as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The historical bond-equity spread, in turn, is often based on the data series published annually in the SBBI Yearbook.
The portfolio of common stocks used as the benchmark for estimating the risk premium should be one that is composed
of a broad array of firms and is well diversified, in order to minimize the potential for it to be contaminated by the
peculiarities of a particular group of common stocks. The SBBI Yearbook database is based upon the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 Index, which meets these criteria. The range of companies in such a broad group as the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 Index covers the broad dimensions of investor perceptions of the trade-off between risk and return, and serves
as a benchmark for investor-required returns. The Commission's proposed rule stipulates the use of the historical
bond-equity spread based on the data published in the SBBI Yearbook. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk premiums based on the historical differential can be extremely volatile and may fluctuate as macroeconomic
and microeconomic conditions change. The time period over which the risk premium is selected should, therefore,
be sufficiently long that short-term aberrations are smoothed out. Such a time period must encompass at least several
business and interest rate cycles. The Commission's proposed rule requires the use of the entire data series (1926&hyph;present)
published annually in the SBBI Yearbook in estimating the risk premium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Debt Security. The particular debt security used to implement the RP model should be one which is, at least in theory,
risk-free and embodies a premium for inflation similar in magnitude to that reflected in common stocks. Satisfying
these criteria would isolate the spread component of the return and obviate the need to make any type of adjustment
to the debt yield to account for default risk, which can vary over time, and obscure the long-term relationship between
returns on common stocks and debt. These criteria are the same as those identified for selecting a debt security to
measure the risk-free rate in implementing the CAPM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission's proposed rule stipulates the use of the six-month average five-year Treasury Note
yield in implementing the RP model, for the reasons identified for selecting this same yield as the risk-free rate
in implementing the CAPM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Risk Adjustment. The risk premium estimate derived from a composite market index is sometimes adjusted if there
are differences in the risk of the firms represented in the common-stock equity index and that of the regulated firm
under consideration. The CAPM (which is actually the company-specific form of the general RP model), for example,
adjusts for such risk differences by multiplying the risk premium by ``beta,'' which serves as the measure of relative
risk in the CAPM model. The Commission's proposed rule specifies that the RP model be used in its general form without
making any adjustment for risk, because the generic form provides a useful benchmark for the range of companies contained
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index on which it is based and, therefore, measures the broad dimensions of investor
perceptions of the trade-off between risk and return. The cost of capital estimate produced using the RP model is not
to be used as the estimate, but instead is to be used as a check on, and in combination with, the cost of capital company-specific
estimates produced using the DCF and CAPM models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Market-to-Book Ratio Method. The MBR method is based on the notion that the market value of a regulated firm's common-stock
equity should be equal to its book value (plus some allowance for underpricing), and will be so if the firm's allowable
rate of return on common-stock equity capital is equal to the firm's cost of common-stock equity capital. The MBR approach
is considered solid conceptually, but is criticized widely for being impractical or even impossible to implement.
In order to apply the MBR, a regulator must be able to accurately predict the effect that its rate order will have on the
common stock price of a regulated firm in attempting to maintain the equality between the market value and book value
of the firm's common stock. Critics argue that regulators are unable to produce such accurate forecasts even when
sophisticated econometric models are used. In addition, a regulator may influence, but cannot control completely,
the market price of the regulated firm's stock. Even if it could, the exercise of such control would produce violent
swings in rate levels which would be uneconomical to both the ratepayer and the regulated firm alike. Finally, diversification
by the regulated firm into unregulated activities could result in a market price that differs from book value, although
the earnings of the regulated segment are restrained.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The severe practical problems involved with implementing the MBR method of computing an allowable rate of return
on common-stock equity capital sharply reduces the utility of the approach. Accordingly, the Commission does not
propose the MBR method of computing an allowable rate of return on common-stock equity capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Comparable Earnings Method. The CE method is based upon the fundamental economic concept of opportunity cost.
This concept states that the cost of using any resource (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, land, labor, or capital) in a particular activity is what that resource could have earned in its next best alternative
use. Thus, the opportunity cost of an investment in a regulated firm's common stock is what the invested funds could
have earned in their next best alternative investment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in another company's common stock, in a government or corporate bond, in real estate, in gold, etc.). In brief, the
CE method infers a regulated company's cost of common-stock equity capital from the average (sometimes the adjusted
average) book value rate of return on common-stock equity of a group of firms comparable in risk to the regulated company.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As already discussed above, the CE method is not thought to be well grounded in economic theory, primarily because
the method is implemented using accounting data rather than market information, and does not accurately reflect
the regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital. Accordingly, the proposed rule does not specify the
CE method for computing the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Final Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital Estimate. Rather than choosing between the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods,
the Commission believes that all three methods should be used to produce separate estimates in arriving at a final
estimate of a regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital, in order to avoid any inappropriate judgments
that could be embodied in any one of the individual estimates. Accordingly, the proposed rule states that the Commission
shall consider the cost of common-stock equity capital estimates obtained using the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods in arriving
at a final cost of common-stock equity capital estimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Other Cost of Capital Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comparable-Risk Companies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. a. Comparable-Risk Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital Estimates. When a regulated firm finances assets with common-stock
equity that does not trade publicly, it is necessary to use a surrogate to impute the firm's cost of common-stock equity
capital. The cost must be imputed because the regulated firm's equity position is not explicitly recognized in the
capital market and, consequently, the necessary data for directly estimating the regulated firm's cost of common-stock
equity do not exist. This occurs when: (1) The regulated firm is an independent company (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, one which has no corporate parent) which issues no publicly traded common-stock equity, or (2) the regulated firm
is a subsidiary of a parent company, and the subsidiary issues no publicly traded common stock of its own. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the independent regulated company which issues no publicly-traded common stock, the cost of common-stock
equity capital must be imputed from a sample of firms having risk similar to that of the regulated company. Once an appropriate
sample is selected, the cost of common-stock equity capital is calculated using the methods described earlier (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, DCF, CAPM, and RP) to produce a range of estimates for the independent regulated company. In the case of the regulated
subsidiary, as discussed above, it may be appropriate to use the consolidated system's capital structure and component
costs to estimate the subsidiary's WACC. If so, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity is obtained
by applying the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods directly to the parent company, provided that the parent issues publicly-traded
common-stock equity so that the stock market price data required for such an application exist. Otherwise, the regulated
subsidiary's capital structure and component costs are used, and it is necessary to impute the subsidiary's cost
of common-stock equity from a sample of firms having risk similar to that of the subsidiary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Selecting a Proxy Group. The proxy group must be composed of companies whose business and financial risks are substantially
comparable to the risk of the regulated firm. Since no two companies are identical in risk characteristics, and because
a company's risk profile may not be perfectly stable over time, at least several companies must be chosen to maximize
the reliability of the estimated cost of common-stock equity capital computed for the regulated company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria for selecting the proxy companies should evaluate the comparability of each company's business risk
and financial risk with those of the regulated firm. Comparability with regard to business risk is most readily and
directly accomplished by selecting companies in the same line of business as the regulated firm. The comparability
of financial risk can be established by analyzing various financial statistics and investment quality ratings which
are commonly used as measures of risk by investors. The Commission's proposed rule sets forth a set of risk criteria
for selecting proxy companies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule further directs carriers that must rely on proxy companies to impute their cost of common-stock
equity capital to use the prescribed risk criteria in selecting proxy companies, and to annually submit their selection
of proxy companies along with their annually filed statement of financial and operating data, as required in &sect;552.2.
After notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall annually designate the respective proxy group of
companies for each applicable carrier in accordance with its prescribed risk criteria. The sequence of steps for
selecting the proxy companies and the prescribed risk criteria are discussed in detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
i. Risk Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Step 1: U.S. Companies Listed in Value Line. The Commission's proposed rule stipulates that the proxy companies
must be U.S.-based, and must be those for which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Value Line Investment Survey (``Value Line'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provides financial data. The proxy companies are to be based in the U.S. so as to maintain consistent accounting and
tax requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Value Line 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contains financial information on 1,700 companies that publicly issue common stock for over 95 industries, including
the transportation sector. The use of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Value Line 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a resource for selecting proxy companies is particularly suitable since it contains the requisite historical
and projected financial data for estimating the cost of common-stock equity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Step 2: Companies that Operate as Common Carriers. Consistent with the concept of selecting firms of comparable
business risk, the proxy companies should be those which are in the same line of business as the regulated firm. The
proxy companies should operate and derive a major portion of their gross revenues primarily as common carriers in
the business of freight transportation. The proxy group, for example, could be comprised of common carriers that
transport freight by air, truck, water, and/or rail. The companies should also own or operate transportation vehicles
or vessels. Excluded from this group are companies with gross revenues equal to or less than the $25,000,000 waiver
level for vessel operating common carriers in the domestic offshore trades, as described in 46 CFR &sect;552.2(e).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Step 3: Financial Analysis of Comparable Risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule further states that the Commission may also consider a company's financial strength in evaluating
the degree of financial risk faced by each of the selected companies. This may include an examination of some, but not
necessarily all, of the factors listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Total Capitalization Ratios and/or Debt/Equity Ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total capitalization ratios and debt/equity ratios measure the proportional mix of financing in a company's capital
structure. They are useful measures of financial risk because they indicate the extent of leverage or fixed-cost
financing in a company (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the degree to which the company's assets are financed by long-term debt and/or preferred stock). A low percentage
of fixed-cost financing generally denotes a low level of financial risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Debt Ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investment analysis services, such as Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, provide investment quality ratings of
companies' long-term debt instruments. These include ratings on corporate bonds and commercial paper. The ratings
reflect a company's risk of default on debt obligations and the possible risk of bankruptcy. The primary basis of the
debt ratings is interest coverage. This represents the number of times a company's earnings are greater than its fixed
contractual charges or interest costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Stock Safety Rankings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Value Line and Standard &amp; Poor's provide common-stock equity rankings for each company listed in their respective
publications. While the basis of their ranking systems differ, they both measure the degree of risk associated with
each company's common-stock equity. Value Line bases its ranking system on the stability of the common stock's price
adjusted for trends, as measured by the standard deviation of weekly percent changes in the stock's market prices
over a five-year period, and partially on the subjective analysis of its financial experts. Value Line's safety scale
ranges from 1, the highest, to 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Financial Strength Ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Value Line rates the financial strength of each of the 1,700 companies listed in its publication relative to all the
others. The ratings are based on key variables that determine financial leverage, business risk, and company size.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ratings range from A++, the highest, to C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Standard Deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard deviation is a common statistical measure which can be used to determine the variability of a company's
common-stock price changes, or returns on common-stock equity. A high standard deviation indicates a high variability
in the range of price changes or returns relative to the average price change or return. Thus, a high standard deviation
implies a greater degree of risk associated with a particular company's common stock. Value Line provides a price
stability index which ranks the standard deviation of the weekly percentage changes in the market price of each company's
common stock over a five-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The Beta Coefficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beta is a regression coefficient that measures the volatility of a company's common-stock price changes, or returns
on common-stock equity, relative to the stock market as a whole. Where beta for the stock market equals one, common
stocks with beta values of less than one are said to be less risky than the market, while stocks with beta values greater
than one are said to be riskier than the market. Value Line and Standard &amp; Poor's provide the beta values associated
with the common stock of each company listed in their respective publications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission may also consider other information commonly accepted by investors as measures of risk in a company.
In this regard, commenters may wish to address whether an accurate measure of comparable risk should include some
consideration of the regulated firm's status as a subsidiary of a larger organization and, if so, whether the criteria
for inclusion in the proxy group should include position in a larger corporate structure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Before-Tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC was defined above as the composite of the cost of the various
classes of capital used by the regulated firm weighted on the basis of the proportions of the total which each class
represents. Corporate taxes were excluded. In reality, a regulated firm typically does pay taxes, and the WACC must
be adjusted accordingly in arriving at a final allowable rate of return. The use of the WACC to determine an allowable
rate of return without making such an adjustment would result in an understatement of the total cost of servicing capital
to ratepayers. Assuming a 40 percent corporate income tax rate, for example, a company requires only $1.00 of revenue
to provide a $1.00 return to bondholders because interest payments are tax deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
The same company requires $1.67 of revenue, however, to provide a $1.00 return to preferred stock and common-stock
equity shareholders because the firm must pay corporate income taxes, and dividend payments to such shareholders
are not tax deductible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following before-tax expression of the WACC (``BTWACC'') recognizes explicitly the existence of income taxes
and is, therefore, the appropriate formula to use in computing an allowable rate of return:

To illustrate the calculation of the BTWACC, consider a hypothetical regulated company that has total invested capital
of $100 million, consisting of $25 million of long-term debt, $15 million of preferred stock, and $60 million of common-stock
equity. Assume that the firm's cost of long-term debt is 7 percent, cost of preferred stock is 9 percent and cost of common-stock
equity is 12 percent, and that the corporate income tax rate is 40 percent. The BTWACC for this firm is calculated as
follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Commission's proposed rule specifies that the allowable rate of return on rate base for a regulated carrier in
the domestic offshore trades shall be set equal to the carrier's WACC calculated on a before-tax basis. The proposed
rule also stipulates the use of the regulated carrier's normalized corporate income tax rate (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the statutory corporate income tax rate, not the actual or effective corporate income tax rate) in computing the
BTWACC. This is consistent with the approach the Commission uses currently in calculating the rate of return on rate
base. Furthermore, the large majority of regulatory commissions in the U.S. use the normalized income tax rate for
ratemaking and accounting purposes.

3. Flotation Costs. Three factors could theoretically result in a firm receiving as net proceeds from the issuance
of common stock an amount less than the pre-announcement common stock price: (1) The cost of floating new issues (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the fee paid to the underwriter) and other administrative expenses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, printing, legal, and accounting expenses); (2) the downward market pressure resulting from the increased supply
of the common stock (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the ``market pressure'' effect); and (3) the potential market price decline related to external market variables
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the ``market break'' effect). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's proposed rule specifies that an allowance for the cost of common-stock equity capital financing
be made for those flotation costs that are actually incurred (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, those that are identifiable and directly attributable to underwriting, printing, legal, and accounting expenses),
but only in the event that the regulated carrier under consideration plans on issuing new common stock to the general
public during the test year in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No allowance would be made for any hypothetical costs such as those associated with market pressure and market break
effects. The proposed rule also specifies that the allowance is to be applied solely to the new common-stock equity
and not to the existing common-stock equity balance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulated carrier would be required to supply the requisite information for computing the allowance.

Deferred Taxes and The Capital Construction Fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under its current rules, the Commission does not address the issue of deferred taxes for calculating rate base. The
Commission proposes to amend its rules to provide for the treatment of deferred taxes, including the Capital Construction
Fund (``Fund''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fund is comprised of three components: (1) The capital account, which results from contributions, (2) capital
gains on investment transactions, and (3) ordinary income, representing the earnings of Fund assets. Section 607
of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;1177, which governs the Fund, provides for different tax treatment
for withdrawals from the various components of the Fund. Section 607 requires that the basis of vessels, barges or
containers purchased with monies from the Fund be reduced by the amount of funds withdrawn from the ordinary income
and capital gains components of the Fund. The proposed rule takes a similar approach, and would require carriers to
reduce the cost of an asset as shown in rate base by the amount of funds withdrawn from the ordinary income and capital
gains components of the Fund which are used in acquiring the asset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A certain portion of a carrier's physical capital (rate base) is financed by deferred taxes. Unlike the debt, preferred
stock, and common-stock equity components of financial capital, deferred taxes cost the carrier nothing. Deferred
taxes are in the nature of an interest-free loan from the government. Given that these funds are obtained at zero cost,
we believe that the carrier should not be allowed a return on that portion of rate base which results from deferred taxes,
except on that portion that results from deferred taxes that may arise from the Fund or the expired Investment Tax Credit,
and that rate base be reduced accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This treatment comports with the treatment of deferred taxes by other federal agencies, as well as a majority of state
regulatory agencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When it is necessary to allocate such accumulated deferred taxes between Commission and non-Commission regulated
activities, such allocation shall be on the ratio of vessels and other property and equipment included in rate base,
less accumulated depreciation, to total company vessels and other property and equipment, less accumulated depreciation.

Working Capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inclusion of working capital in rate base is intended to recognize the necessity for the carrier to maintain an
adequate supply of cash for the purpose of meeting expenditure requirements during the period between the payment
of expenses and the collection of revenue. Average voyage expense is used as the measure of working capital for a self-propelled
vessel operator under the Commission's existing rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the treatment of insurance expense in the computation of average voyage expense, the Commission's
current regulations provide for the inclusion of 90 days' hull and machinery insurance and protection and indemnity
insurance. Hawaii suggests that insurance expense be treated in the same manner as other operating expenses, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
include that amount applicable to the duration of an average voyage. The proposed rule adopts that approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Allocation of Assets and Expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1980, the Commission amended its rules governing the allocation of assets and expenses. As a result of these changes,
cargo cube or space occupied replaced weight or revenue ton as the basis for allocations. The rationale for this decision
was that in a containership operation, the cost of providing service is the cost of providing space. The Commission
concluded that the carrier's cost per container remains the same regardless of the amount of cargo in the container
or revenue generated by the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, part 552 currently prescribes that vessels, accumulated depreciation and vessel expense shall be
allocated on the cargo-cube-mile relationship as defined in 46 CFR 552.5(n), while those expenses related to cargo
handling are allocated on the basis of cargo cube loaded and discharged. Other property and equipment, and administrative
and general expenses are required to be allocated on the voyage expense relationship, as defined in 46 CFR 552.5(p).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters in Docket No. 91&hyph;51 suggested several alternative allocation methods, including a method based
on cargo carried on the outbound portion of the voyage or based on revenue generated by Commission and non-Commission
regulated cargo. These proposals stemmed from the bifurcation of regulatory authority in the domestic offshore
trades between the Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission. However, that split in jurisdiction has no
direct connection with the costs a carrier incurs in providing service. The Commission shall not attempt to contrive
an allocation methodology as a solution to an issue that can best be remedied by legislative action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Maritime Commission certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.
605(n), that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including
small businesses, small organizational units and small government jurisdictions. The Commission grants a waiver
of the detailed reporting requirements to carriers which earn gross revenues of $25 million or less in a particular
trade in accordance with 46 CFR 552.2(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), as amended.
The incremental public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to range from an average
of 41 hours to 65 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments
regarding this burden estimate, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Sandra L. Kusumoto, Director,

and deductions during the period, adjusted to reflect the use of the Capital Construction Fund, shall also be reported.
The carrier shall report as though all such changes took place at midyear, except those involving substantial sums,
which shall be prorated on a daily basis. Allocation to the Trade shall be based upon the actual use of the specific asset
or group of assets within the Trade. For those assets employed in a general capacity, such as office furniture and fixtures,
the voyage expense relationship shall be employed for allocation purposes. The basis of allocation to the Trade shall
be set forth and fully explained.

short and long-term, on debt and lease obligations. Payments on long-term debt are to be calculated consistent with
the method set forth in &sect;552.6(e)(7) for computing the cost of long-term debt capital. Principal and interest
shall be allocated to the Trade in the ratio that Trade rate base less working capital bears to company-wide assets
less current assets. Where related company assets are employed by the filing company, the balance sheet figures on
the related company's books for such assets shall be added to the company-wide total in computing the ratio. In those
instances where interest expenses are capitalized in accordance with paragraph (b)(9) of this section, a deduction
shall be made for the amount so capitalized.

the BTWACC. The subsidiary carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital shall be inferred as the cost of common-stock

(i) Concurrently with the filing of the annual financial statements required under &sect;552.2, a carrier must submit
for Commission approval a proxy group of companies to impute the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital where:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The carrier is an independent company (i.e., it has no corporate parent) which issues no publicly-traded common-stock
equity, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The carrier is a subsidiary that obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission will approve a proxy group of companies based on the
following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The proxy companies shall be based in the United States and shall be listed in The Value Line Investment Survey.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The proxy companies shall operate and derive a major portion of their gross revenues primarily as common carriers
in the business of freight transportation, and shall own or operate transportation vehicles or vessels. Companies
with gross annual revenues equal to or less than the $25,000,000 shall be excluded from the proxy group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In addition, comparable risk companies shall be selected by examining some, but not necessarily all, of the following
risk indicators:

(i) Upon application, after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission may authorize use of the capital structure
of the consolidated system (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the parent company and all of its subsidiaries) in computing the BTWACC. The application must show that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The subsidiary carrier's parent company issues publicly traded common-stock equity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The subsidiary carrier's parent company owns 90 percent or more of the subsidiary's voting shares of stock; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The business and the financial risks of the subsidiary carrier and the parent company are similar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The similarity of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's business risk shall be evaluated by examining
the degree to which the consolidated system's profits, revenues, and expenses are composed of those of the subsidiary
carrier, and the extent to which the parent's holdings are diversified into lines of business unrelated to those of
the subsidiary carrier, and/or other indicators of business risk deemed appropriate by the Commission. The similarity
of the parent company's and subsidiary carrier's financial risk shall be evaluated by examining the consolidated
system's and the subsidiary's total capitalization ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, investment quality rankings
on short- and long-term debt instruments, times-interest-earned ratios, fixed charges coverage ratios (calculated
to include both FMC and non-FMC regulated operations), and/or other measures of financial risk deemed appropriate
by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When the consolidated capital structure is used, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity capital
(issued by the parent company), the consolidated system's cost of long-term debt capital, the consolidated system's
cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital, and the consolidated system's composite statutory corporate
income tax rate shall also be used in estimating the subsidiary's BTWACC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Where the Commission has approved the use of a consolidated capital structure, such use will not be subject to
challenge in a subsequent rate investigation brought under section (3) of the Intercoastal Act, 1933.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Capitalization ratios representing the capital structure used in deriving a carrier's BTWACC shall be computed
on the basis of average projected book value outstanding over the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear
rate base in &sect;552.2 (f)(1)(ii). The average amount of any class of capital outstanding used in determining the
capitalization ratios is computed by adding the amount of a particular type of capital expected to be outstanding
as of the beginning of the 12-month period to the amount of that same type of capital expected to be outstanding as of
the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the sum of the two amounts outstanding by two.

A carrier shall show its long-term debt, preferred stock, and common-stock equity capitalization amounts outstanding,
stated in book value terms, as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to calculate projected midyear
rate base, and the average amounts and average ratios for that 12-month period. Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a
parent company, the carrier shall show its own capitalization amounts and ratios unless the carrier applies for and
receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such
permission is granted, the carrier shall show instead the consolidated system's capitalization amounts and ratios.

The RP model shall be used in its generic form and the risk premium specified herein shall not be adjusted for any possible
differences in the risk of the firms represented in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index and that of the carrier
under consideration. The generic RP model shall be used as a benchmark for the range of companies contained in the Standard

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The corporate income tax rate used in computing the BTWACC shall be the carrier's composite statutory corporate income
tax rate for the 12-month period used to compute projected midyear rate base. Such rate shall be a composite of the carrier's
Federal and State income tax rates, and of any other income tax rate to be applied to the carrier's income by any other
entity to which the carrier is to pay income taxes. The carrier shall calculate and show its composite statutory corporate
income tax rate as well as its Federal, State, and any other applicable statutory income tax rates separately for the
12-month period used to compute projected midyear rate base. The carrier shall also state the name of any entity other
than the Federal and State governments to which it is to pay taxes. Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company,
the carrier shall show its own statutory corporate income tax rates unless the carrier applies for and receives permission
from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted,
the carrier shall show instead the consolidated system's statutory corporate income tax rates.

to the parent company's issuance of new common-stock equity, provided that such carrier applies for and receives
permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC.

 This notice amends a notice of public hearings that appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15151), by adding an additional public hearing and soliciting public comments at all hearings
on draft Amendment 10 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. Draft Amendment
10 will include the following management measures: (1) A change in the cutoff date from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 19, 1992, to February 7, 1994, to qualify for a fish trap endorsement during the current 3-year trap moratorium.
This change would allow a fish trap endorsement on a reef fish permit, which is required to use fish traps, to be issued
or renewed by NMFS for a current owner of a permitted vessel who has a record of reef fish landings from fish traps in the
Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone between 1991 and 1994 as reported on vessel logbooks received by NMFS on or before
February 7, 1994; and (2) establishment of a Council appeals board, the members of which would recommend to the Director,
Southeast Region, NMFS, whether additional endorsements should be issued based on demonstrated financial hardship
related to trap fishing or based on an incapacitating illness between November 19, 1992, and February 7, 1994. All
other information, as contained in the notice of public hearings published March 31, 1994, remains the same.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA; Bureau) is proposing to amend the existing Financial Assistance and Social Services
Program regulations to incorporate rules for adult care services and the work experience program. Additionally,
a quality assurance section is being incorporated to enable the BIA to assess the quality of the social services it
provides, measure compliance with regulations and adherence to internal control requirements, and provide specific
guidelines for administering the programs. An amendment is also being incorporated to establish rules on the treatment
of per capita payments when determining eligibility for participation in social services programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Experience in program administration and outside audit findings have indicated that regulatory amendments are
needed to define with greater clarity the programs provided under this part. A primary purpose of the amendments is
to provide clear, concise guidelines that will effect a reduction in eligibility error rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments are being made in 25 CFR 20.1, Definitions; 20.2, Purpose; 20.3, Policy; 20.20, General and 20.23 Miscellaneous
Assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following new sections are added: 20.15, Reporting requirements for all social services programs; 20.16, Staffing
requirements; 20.26, Adult care assistance program; 20.27, Work experience program; and 20.35, Quality assurance
reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the location identified in the ``addresses'' section of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that these proposed regulations meet the
applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) of Executive Order 12778. BIA has made every effort to ensure that
the proposed rules specify their effect on existing regulations, and provide clear, certain language to promote
burden reduction and avoid litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, and therefore will not be reviewed at the Office of Management and Budget. The rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).
In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that the rules do not have ``significant
takings'' implications. The rules do not pertain to ``taking'' of private property interests, nor do they impact
private property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects under Executive
Order 12612 and will not interfere with the roles, rights and responsibilities of states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in 25 CFR 20.4 will be submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The collection of this information will not be required until
it has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget.

Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In the administration of general assistance, child welfare assistance, burial and disaster assistance, family
and community services, adult care assistance and work experience programs, it is the policy of the BIA to provide
services to eligible Indians in a manner designed to promote individual self-determination, family unity, economic
and social stability, and the attainment of personal independence and self-reliance. Through the application of
professional social work skills and principles, it is BIA policy to work with Indians to promote and maintain social
environments in their communities that emphasize safety and well-being for all children; promote family stability;
and value individual independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In administering social services programs, it is also BIA policy to emphasize the importance of individual case
planning. The goal of case plan implementation is to assist people to become self-sufficient, preventing dependency,
strengthening family relationships, and restoring individuals, families or groups to successful social functioning.
When an ineligible adult is a member of an assistance household, the case plan shall address the spousal, parental
and/or custodial responsibilities of the ineligible person relative to the financial support of the eligible members
of the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Further, it is BIA policy to ensure, insofar as possible, that Indians have full access to available Federal and
state services. Therefore, the financial assistance and social services programs authorized under this part are
secondary resources and are provided only when assistance or services are not available from state, local, or other
primary providers.

(e) Adult care is to be provided in the setting determined to be the least restrictive (in-home care, adult day care,
foster care, group home, or institutional) for the specific individual adult. If appropriate, and when a qualified
care provider is available, in-home care is preferred. When an institutional or group care setting is in the adult's
best interest, the preferred placement shall be in a facility located as close as possible to his/her home community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Consider all available resources when determining eligibility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine the amount of the assistance payment for which the client is eligible based upon the deficit remaining
after all available resources are deducted from the cost of care.

(h) Redetermination of adult care eligibility and the payment level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The BIA shall redetermine financial eligibility and the amount of the BIA payment based upon the deficit between
the cost of care and resources available to the adult in need of care, including other Federal, state, or public assistance
resources. Recipients or their authorized representatives are required to inform the BIA immediately of any changes
in status that may affect eligibility or the amount of assistance. The BIA shall redetermine eligibility whenever
there is an indication of a change in circumstances affecting eligibility, but not less frequently than once every
six months for each recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The redetermination process shall include personal contact with the recipient in the actual placement setting.
The purposes of the contact are to evaluate changes in the adult's personal circumstances or condition and to assess
the need for continued assistance.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes a revision to the distribution method for Housing Improvement Program (HIP) funds from a housing
inventory basis to documented eligible applicants. A technical correction is also made to eliminate Category C,
Downpayments which is inconsistent with the intent of the HIP. A revision is proposed to eliminate individuals who
own a home acquired under Federal housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through
an Indian Housing Authority from being served under HIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since FY 1986, the BIA has distributed HIP funds using a formula that is based on biennial housing inventories submitted
by individual tribes. The funding calculation formula is based on 90% of the repair need and up to 10% of the new construction
need indicated by the inventories, except for Alaska where the percentages are 95% and 35%. These figures are converted
to dollars, and the dollar amount is divided by the number of years required to complete a work plan. The formula is the
basis for proportional distribution of appropriated funds. The use of percentages based on an assumed HIP responsibility
does not reflect an accurate picture of individuals eligible for HIP assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a variety of reasons, many of the housing inventories are not accurate. Accuracy would require a house-by-house
assessment and completion of a housing inventory work sheet describing the condition of each house inventoried to
support the repair or replacement decision. Most tribes do not have sufficient qualified personnel with a construction
background to complete the work sheet accurately. Presently, there is no requirement to determine whether the individual
house is occupied and owned by a person who is eligible for HIP assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 1&hyph;5, 1993, the Joint Tribal/DOI/BIA Reorganization Task
Force recommended that HIP be transferred in FY 1995 to the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) section of the budget
where program priorities and funding levels are established by individual tribes. They further recommended that
the resource allocation methodology for HIP be revised from housing inventory to documented eligible applicants
to ensure that funding distribution better responds to need.

(c) Beginning in FY 1995 HIP funds will be distributed to tribes proportionally based upon the total number of documented
program-eligible applicants submitted by all tribes. Tribes shall make every effort to advertise the opportunity
to apply for housing assistance to all member and non-member Indians residing within the designated service area.
Tribes shall review HIP applications for eligibility in accordance with &sect;256.6 and ensure that appropriate
records and documents to verify eligibility are on file. On or before August 1, 1994, each Tribe shall submit to the
Area Office a list of documented program-eligible applicants that also specifies the category of service to be provided
to each applicant. This list shall be accompanied by the applications and a tribal resolution affirming the accuracy
of the list. The Area housing staff will review the HIP applications and certify that they have done so before submitting
the list of documented eligible applicants to the Central Office. In some instances, it may be easier for the Area housing
staff to inspect the applications at the tribal offices. This decision may be made locally.

(d) Beginning in FY 1995, HIP funds shall be included in the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) section of the BIA budget.
Beginning in FY 1996, each tribe shall establish its own funding level for HIP within the TPA allocation based upon
the number of eligible applicants it plans to serve in that year. Tribes are encouraged to provide adequate funding
to meet the housing needs of individuals residing within the designated service area. Every effort shall be made to
use HIP funds in conjunction with other programs so that the result will be a greater amount of housing improvements
than would otherwise be possible with the HIP funds alone. Other funding sources shall be used only to supplement HIP
funds, not as a means to exceed the regulatory cost limits for the category of service.

At least every two years, each tribe shall develop a single priority list of applicants who satisfy the eligibility
requirements of &sect;256.6. The priority list shall be developed using a ranking system based upon five basic factors
of need: Annual income, family size, overcrowded living conditions, age, and handicap or disability. Eligible applicants
may receive points for any or all of these five criteria in accordance with the point schedule contained in Appendix
A of this part. Individuals with a total score below zero, as a result of earning negative points for income, shall not
be considered eligible and shall not be served. Housing assistance will be provided to individuals in priority order
based upon the number of points earned. Eligibility information should be revalidated before service is actually
provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete the regulations contained in the Code of Federal Regulations
pursuant to the public law which suspended all deposits to Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor (IMPL) accounts after
September 30, 1982. The law eliminated the use of IMPL accounts, and since these accounts are no longer in use, they
will be removed from the BIA accounting system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rulemaking action will delete part 113 of subchapter G of chapter I of title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
which contains regulations governing Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor (IMPL) established under the Act of March
3, 1883, as amended (25 U.S.C. 155).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the amendments contained in Public Law 197&hyph;257, title I, section 100, 25 U.S.C. 155 B, which provided
that, ``No funds shall be deposited in such `Indian monies, proceeds of labor' (IMPL) accounts after September 30,
1982,'' all deposits to IMPL accounts were discontinued. The unobligated IMPL balances at the close of business on
September 30, 1982, including the income resulting from investment of funds from such accounts prior to such date,
were transferred to and held in escrow accounts. After consultation with appropriate tribes and individual Indians
up to September 30, 1985, to determine the extent to which the funds held in escrow accounts represented income from
the investment of ``special deposits'' relating to individual Indians or a specific tribe, funds were transferred
to appropriate trust accounts for individual Indians and tribes during the period of October 1, 1985, through September
30, 1987. The unobligated balances of the IMPL escrow accounts as of the close of business on September 30, 1987, are
to be withdrawn and deposited into miscellaneous receipts of the U.S. Treasury. The IMPL accounts are to be removed
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs trust accounting system and are no longer available for use.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter the Service) proposes to establish annual hunting regulations for
certain migratory game birds. The Service also requests proposals from Indian Tribes that wish to establish special
migratory bird hunting regulations. These regulations will permit the taking of the designated species during the
1994&hyph;95 season. The Service annually prescribes outside limits (frameworks) within which States may select
hunting seasons. The Service has also employed guidelines to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations
on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. These seasons provide hunting opportunities for recreation and
sustenance; aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds; and are designed
to permit harvests at levels compatible with migratory bird population and habitat conditions.

Notice of Intent to Establish Open Seasons
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the intention of the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to establish open hunting seasons
and daily bag and possession limits for certain designated groups or species of migratory game birds for 1994&hyph;1995
in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, under &sect;&sect;20.101
through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110 of subpart K of 50 CFR part 20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Migratory game birds'' are those bird species so designated in conventions between the United States and several
foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds. For the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, regulations
will be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae
(doves and pigeons); Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens, and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock
and snipe). These proposals are described under Proposed 1994&hyph;95 Migratory Game Bird Hunting Regulations
(Preliminary) in this document. Definitions of waterfowl flyways and mourning dove management units, as well as
a description of the data used in and the factors affecting the regulatory process, were published in the March 14,
1990, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is the first in a series of proposed and final rulemaking documents for migratory game bird hunting regulations.
Proposals relating to the harvest of migratory game birds that may be initiated after publication of this proposed
rulemaking will be made available for public review in supplemental proposed rulemakings to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Also, additional supplemental proposals will be published for public comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as population, habitat, harvest, and other information becomes available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the late dates when certain portions of these data become available, it is anticipated that comment periods
on some proposals will necessarily be abbreviated. Special circumstances that limit the amount of time which the
Service can allow for public comment are involved in the establishment of these regulations. Specifically, two considerations
compress the time in which the rulemaking process must operate: the need, on one hand, to establish final rules at a
time early enough in the summer to allow resource agencies to select and publish season dates and bag limits prior to
the hunting seasons and, on the other hand, the lack of current data on the status of most migratory game birds until
later in the summer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the process is strongly influenced by the times when information is available for consideration, the overall
regulations process is divided into two segments. Early seasons are those seasons that generally open prior to October
1, and include seasons in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Late seasons are those seasons opening
in the remainder of the United States about October 1 and later, and include most of the waterfowl seasons.

Two public hearings pertaining to 1994&hyph;1995 migratory game bird hunting regulations are scheduled. Both hearings
will be conducted in accordance with 455 DM 1 of the Departmental Manual. On June 23, a public hearing will be held at
9 a.m. in the Auditorium of the Department of the Interior Building, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC. This hearing
is for the purpose of reviewing the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations
will be discussed for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands; special September waterfowl seasons in designated States; special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway,
and extended falconry seasons. On August 4, a public hearing will be held at 9 a.m. in the Auditorium of the Department
of the Interior Building, address above. This hearing is for the purpose of reviewing the status and proposed regulations
for waterfowl not previously discussed at the June 23 public hearing. The public is invited to participate in both
hearings. Persons wishing to make a statement at these hearings should write to the address indicated under the caption

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning with the 1985-86 hunting season, the Service has employed guidelines described in the June 4, 1985 Federal
Register (50 FR 23467) to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations on Federal Indian reservations (including
off-reservation trust lands) and ceded lands. The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service
recognition of their reserved hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting
by both tribal and nontribal members throughout their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for:
(1) on-reservation hunting by both tribal and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations
to take place within Federal frameworks, but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s);
(2) on-reservation hunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length,
and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside
of usual framework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all
cases, the regulations established under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the annual March 10 to September
1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada) For the Protection
of Migratory Birds (Convention). The guidelines are capable of application to those tribes that have reserved hunting
rights on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands) and ceded lands. They also apply
to the establishment of migratory bird hunting regulations for nontribal members on all lands within the exterior
boundaries of reservations where tribes have full wildlife management authority over such hunting, or where the
tribes and affected States otherwise have reached agreement over hunting by nontribal members on non-Indian lands.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting by nonmembers on Indian-owned reservation
lands, subject to Service approval. The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that include lands
owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States have established or intend to establish regulations
governing hunting by non-Indians on these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and States to reach
agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations. When appropriate, the Service will consult
with a tribe and State with the aim of facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointly with tribal and
State officials in the affected States where tribes may wish to establish special hunting regulations for tribal
members on ceded lands. As explained in previous rulemaking documents, it is incumbent upon the tribe and/or the State
to put forward a request for consultation as a result of the proposal being published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Service will not presume to make a determination, without being advised by a tribe or a State, that any issue is/is
not worthy of formal consultation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the guidelines provides for the continuation of harvest of migratory game birds by tribal members on reservations
where it is a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, provided it does not take place during the
closed season required by the Convention, and it is not so large as to adversely affect the status of the migratory bird
resource. For several years, the Service has reached annual agreement with tribes (for example, in Minnesota, the
Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians) for hunting by tribal members on their lands or on lands where they have reserved
hunting rights. The Service will continue to consult with tribes that wish to reach a mutual agreement on hunting regulations
for on-reservation hunting by tribal members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible. Nevertheless, the Service believes that they provide appropriate
opportunity to accommodate the reserved hunting rights and management authority of Indian tribes while ensuring
that the migratory bird resource receives necessary protection. The conservation of this important international
resource is paramount. Use of the guidelines is not required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations established
by the State(s) in which the reservation is located.

Details Needed in Tribal Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tribes that wish to use the guidelines to establish special hunting regulations for the 1994-95 hunting season must
submit a proposal that includes: (1) The requested hunting season dates and other details regarding regulations
to be observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure
or monitor harvest (mail-questionnaire survey, bag checks, etc.); (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest,
where it could be shown that failure to limit such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and
(5) tribal capabilities to establish and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A tribe that desires the earliest possible opening of the waterfowl season should specify this in the proposal, rather
than request a date that might not be within the final Federal frameworks. Similarly, unless a tribe wishes to set more
restrictive regulations than Federal regulations will permit, the proposal should request the same daily bag and
possession limits and season length for ducks and geese that Federal regulations are likely to permit the States in
the Flyway in which the reservation is located.

 documents. Because of the time required for Service and public review, Indian tribes that desire special migratory
bird hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season should submit their proposals as soon as possible,
but no later than June 3, 1994. Tribal inquiries regarding the guidelines and proposals should be directed to the appropriate
Service Regional Office. Tribes that request special hunting regulations for tribal members on ceded lands should
send a courtesy copy of the proposal to officials in the affected State(s).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to issuance of the 1994&hyph;95 migratory game bird hunting regulations, consideration will be given to provisions
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; hereinafter the Act) to ensure that hunting
is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species designated as endangered or threatened or modify
or destroy its critical habitat and is consistent with conservation programs for those species. Consultations under
section 7 of this Act may cause changes to be made to proposals in this and future supplemental proposed rulemaking
documents.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document was reviewed under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Therefore, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget instructions, a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis
(FRIA) was prepared in 1981 and revised in 1990. Although a FRIA is no longer required, the economic analysis contained
in the FRIA has been reviewed and the Service has determined that it meets the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
This analysis was updated for 1994. The FRIA update included waterfowl hunter and harvest information from the 1992&hyph;93
season. The summary of the 1994 update follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``New information which can be compared to that appearing in the 1990 Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) includes
estimates of the 1992 fall flight of ducks from surveyed areas, and hunter activity and harvest information from the
1992&hyph;93 hunting season. There was essentially no change in the total fall flight of ducks, regulatory frameworks,
hunter numbers, number of hunting days, or total duck harvest between the 1991&hyph;92 and the 1992&hyph;93 seasons.''

Pending current information on populations, harvest, and habitat conditions, and receipt of recommendations from
the four Flyway Councils; specific framework proposals (including opening and closing dates, seasons lengths,
and bag limits) may be deferred. Unless otherwise specified, no change from the final 1993&hyph;94 frameworks of
August 23 and September 24, 1993, (58 FR 44590 and 50188) is proposed. Specific preliminary proposals that vary from
the 1993&hyph;94 frameworks and issues requiring early discussion, action, or the attention of the States or Tribes
are contained below:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the Service allowed the State of California an additional year to modify its zoning proposal to conform more
closely with the Service's policy. The Service encourages a reopening of dialogue in order to resolve this problem
as soon as possible.

i. Canvasback Management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During 1983-92, annual sport-harvest regulations for this species were guided by provisions in the environmental
assessment ``Proposed Hunting Regulations on Canvasback Ducks, 1983''. That document acknowledged separate eastern
and western populations and set breeding-population threshold levels for each, below which all possible actions,
including season closure, in the respective regions, would be considered for canvasbacks. In 1993, after completing
a review of canvasback databases, the Service determined that currently there is not sufficient evidence to warrant
managing canvasbacks as separate eastern and western populations. However, the Service did not adopt a new harvest
strategy to regulate the overall harvest of canvasbacks and the allocation of that harvest. Rather, it continued
to follow guidelines set forth in the environmental assessment for a continental population. Because the most recent
3-year average (482,000 birds) was below the threshold identified in the assessment (500,000 birds), the Service
determined liberalizations were not warranted during 1993-94; no changes in regulations from those which occurred
during 1992-93 were enacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Service delayed implementation of a revised harvest strategy, the Service is not satisfied with an indefinite
continuation of the 1983 guidelines. The Service desires to build consensus on an improved harvest-management strategy
which ensures the welfare of the canvasback population and preserves the historical emphasis on Flyway-based management.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has circulated to the Flyway Councils and Technical Sections a draft harvest-management strategy to
be considered for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season and continues to welcome suggestions for improving our capabilities
to manage the harvests of this important species. Copies of the draft harvest-management strategy are available
at the address indicated under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evaluations of shooting hours for teal seasons were initiated in several Mississippi and Central Flyway States in
1993, and more than 1 year likely will be required to achieve needed sample sizes. Provided methods being employed
are acceptable and the amount of progress being made indicates a good-faith effort, we would recommend continuation
of presunrise shooting hours conditional upon satisfactory progress toward completion of evaluations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the Service announced that the administrative process for setting hunting seasons does not permit the setting
of regular seasons that open prior to the Saturday nearest October 1 during the late-season regulations-development
cycle. Those portions of seasons that open earlier must be established during the early-season regulations-development
cycle in June. The Service is concerned about setting seasons in the absence of current status information. Because
of this, requests for regular Canada goose seasons that open earlier than the Saturday nearest October 1 must include
full justification of the need for the early opening, which will be weighed against the risk of establishing seasons
prior to the time status information is available. The Service proposed to implement these procedures beginning
with the 1994-95 hunting season in order to allow those States desiring early-season dates for regular Canada goose
seasons sufficient time to prepare their proposals and to provide an opportunity for flyway council review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the Central Flyway Council recommended a review of framework closing dates for light geese. The Service indicated
it would work with the Flyway Councils during the coming year to review its policy of framework dates for light geese.
At this time, the Service requests that the States and Flyway Councils submit any pertinent information for joint
review and that the Service, States, Flyway Councils, and other interested parties accelerate discussions regarding
closing dates for light geese in migration-terminus and other areas.

9. Sandhill Cranes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has clearly indicated that it does not believe it is appropriate to increase harvest on the Mid-continent
Population at this time, and that there should be no increase or shift in harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation,
especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. In recent years, the Central Flyway Council has requested changes
in the frameworks which would increase harvest pressure on this population. The Service recognizes the desire of
the Central Flyway Council to liberalize regulations in certain areas, but concern for greater sandhill cranes would
preclude any increase under the current approach to establishing frameworks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because there is an east-west gradient in the distribution of the 3 subspecies managed as the Mid-continent Population,
the Service would be willing to consider an approach that would, in the future, provide the ability to establish frameworks
by geographic areas within the Central Flyway. Such an approach of setting differential frameworks would provide
the ability to shift harvest toward the western portions of the flyway, while limiting harvest in eastern portions.
The Service requests comments regarding such an approach.

15. Band-tailed Pigeons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evidence from three separate surveys suggests that the long-term decline experienced by the Coastal Population
may have subsided; and, in fact, the overall and individual State population estimates appear to have stabilized
at low levels. Also, the status of the Interior Population is not well understood. Efforts are underway to gather more
information about both populations. In 1993, all States having band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons either participated
in the nationwide Migratory Bird harvest Information Program or required band-tailed pigeon hunters to obtain mandatory
State permits to provide sampling frames for obtaining more precise estimates of band-tailed pigeon harvest. Those
States issuing permits were required to conduct a harvest survey and provide the results to the Service by June 1 of
each year. In addition, all States with band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons are participating in a wing-collection
survey to provide information on annual recruitment. The Service will continue to closely monitor population and
harvest information from both populations and will evaluate this information in June prior to making any decisions
regarding the 1994-95 seasons. Indian Tribes also should consider this situation when proposing harvest regulations
for this species.
