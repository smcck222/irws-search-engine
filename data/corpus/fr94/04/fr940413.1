SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) of the Department of Agriculture gives notice that
it is currently planning to issue a proposed rule to implement U.S. end-use certificates for commodities imported
from any foreign country or instrumentality that requires end-use certificates. The proposed action is in accordance
with section 321(f) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (the Act) which requires
such action be taken by the Secretary of Agriculture. The primary purpose of the U.S. end-use certificate requirement
is to help ensure that foreign agricultural commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs.
ASCS requests comments and suggestions from the public on the alternatives and issues that need to be addressed in
implementing such a proposal including, but not limited to, those issues mentioned in this notice. Supporting data
for comments are requested.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 321(f) of the Act established an end-use certificate requirement for wheat and barley imported into the U.S.
from any foreign country, such as Canada, or instrumentality that requires end-use certificates for imports that
are products of the U.S. The primary purpose of the U.S. end-use certificate requirement is to help ensure that foreign
produced agricultural commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs. The Act is not specific
regarding the type of end-use certificate system to be implemented or the information to be collected. The Secretary
of Agriculture is directed to issue regulations regarding the information to be provided in end-use certificates.
The information could include type of commodity, class, quantity, country of origin, importer of the commodity,
and the end-use of the commodity, if known at the time of importation of the commodity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a means of protecting the interests of U.S. agricultural producers, the Act provides that the Secretary may, after
consulting with domestic producers and reporting to the Congress, suspend end-use certificate requirements if
the requirements have directly resulted in the reduction of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Income to U.S. producers of agricultural commodities, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Competitiveness of U.S. agricultural commodities in world export markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a foreign country or instrumentality that requires end-use certificates eliminates its system, the Secretary
is to suspend the U.S. end-use certificate requirement 30 calendar days after the suspension by the foreign country
or instrumentality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Act provides that it shall be a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 for a person to engage in fraud or knowingly violate
Section 321(f) or applicable regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of this date, only Canada requires end-use certificates on U.S. grain entering the country.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current statutes provide that only commodities produced in the U.S. may be considered eligible for use in U.S. Government-assisted
export programs. These programs have proved to be an important vehicle for developing commercial export markets,
meeting humanitarian food needs, and spurring economic and agricultural growth in developing countries. In essence,
the programs help U.S. agricultural producers by developing and expanding export markets for their commodities
and improving the competitiveness of those commodities in world markets. For example, in the case of wheat, approximately
80 percent of U.S. wheat exported in recent years was done so under at least one of USDA's export programs. Given that
the U.S. is striving toward a free and fair environment for the trade of agricultural commodities in North America
(e.g., through NAFTA and Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)), the Congress, recognizing
the important role that U.S. Government-assisted export programs play in the U.S. economy, has approved legislation
which endeavors to ensure the integrity of such programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main question this notice poses is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What type of end-use certificate system will best accomplish the objective of helping ensure that foreign agricultural
commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs while still maintaining compatibility with
the grain merchandising system of the U.S.? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are current handling and reporting requirements such that the gathering of additional information on the use of imported
grain will be sufficient to meet U.S. origin requirements of Government-assisted export programs? Or are more stringent
handling requirements necessary to ensure that imported grain will not be used in U.S. Government-assisted export
programs? While one of several alternative systems could be implemented, all systems have advantages and disadvantages.
Thus, consideration must be given to the effects such a system will have on U.S. producers, importers, warehouses,
grain handlers, millers, processors, exporters, feedlot operators, and ultimately, U.S. consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. U.S. Grain System vs. Canadian Grain System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because Canada is the only country currently requiring end-use certificates, a comparison of the U.S. and Canadian
marketing systems is helpful. The handling and distribution of grain in the U.S. is based on blending various grades
and qualities from different locations to reach the quality attributes desired by the buyer. The Canadian grain handling
and distribution system is quite different. That system preserves the origin and, in some cases, the variety of Canadian
grain. Blending and commingling different lots of grain are not part of normal commercial practices in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Canadian End-Use System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Canadian end-use system reflects their marketing system. The Government of Canada (GOC) requires that U.S. milling
wheat and barley imported into Canada be accompanied by an end-use certificate. This is to ensure that non-Canadian
grain does not become commingled with Canadian grain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GOC position is that it wants to protect Canada's strict varietal licensing system which has been designed to select
what they view as superior quality grain varieties. In addition, mirroring U.S. concern, the GOC wants to avoid any
concern that U.S. grain might take advantage of GOC domestic or export programs, such as the Western Grain Transportation
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a U.S. grain exporter wants to ship grain to Canada, an end-user (the consignee) must be identified. The U.S. grain
must be consigned directly to a milling, manufacturing, brewing, distilling, or other processing facility for consumption
at that facility. Three months after the Canadian consignee receives the imported U.S. grain, the consignee is required
to file quarterly reports until the imported grain has been fully consumed as a food or feed ingredient. After the grain
has arrived at the location specified in the end-use certificate, it must be stored and handled separately and cannot
be moved or used for any other purpose than that specified in the end-use certificate without the permission of the
GOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grain imported into Canada for direct feed-use must be ``denatured'' before it can be transported across the border.
GOC regulations define ``denatured'' as any lot containing at least 10 percent permanently colored kernels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What type of end-use certificate system will best accomplish the objective of helping ensure that foreign agricultural
commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs while still maintaining compatibility with
the grain merchandising system of the U.S.? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should a U.S. end-use system be patterned after the Canadian end-use system and, if so, in what way? Should a U.S. end-use
system simply adopt the Canadian provisions? Or, in that the Canadian system reflects the Canadian marketing system,
should the U.S. adopt an end-use system that also reflects the U.S. marketing system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key issue separating the following alternatives involves the issue of commingling vs. separate storage (i.e.,
identity preservation) of imported and U.S. origin grain. In brief, the proposed alternatives are as follow: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Allow commingling of imported and U.S. grain. Require that a certificate which collects all relevant information
be issued at the U.S. border on imported grain. Continue (or modify) current ASCS rules and policies that help ensure
that foreign agricultural commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Allow commingling of imported and U.S. grain. Require that the commingled imported and U.S. grain be stored separately
from U.S. origin grain until delivered to the end-user. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prohibit commingling of imported and U.S. grain. Require that imported grain be stored separately from U.S. origin
grain until delivered to the end-user. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following provides additional information on the proposed alternatives. Variations on these alternatives
may also be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ASCS could implement a ``border certificate'' system in which, as the agricultural commodity crosses the U.S.
border, the importer would complete a form identifying the various required information elements. Under this scenario,
certificates would be issued and collected at the border. ASCS could compile data, publish reports, and perform compliance
checks based on the information collected. This alternative would be the simplest of the alternatives to operate
and administer. It would not impose any additional burden on the U.S. grain handling sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ASCS could implement a system which tracks commingled grain. This scenario would allow foreign agricultural
commodities to be blended and commingled with U.S. commodities under the requirement that all lots containing commingled
U.S. and foreign agricultural commodities be tracked, with a complete paper-trail, throughout the entire U.S. commodity
system. This alternative would permit the blending and commingling of U.S. and Canadian grain, but only under the
condition that all lots containing even a trace amount of Canadian grain be identified and tracked through the grain
system. For example, if one ton of Canadian wheat was imported and blended with 10 tons of U.S. wheat, that entire lot
would have to be identified as commingled U.S.-Canadian wheat and tracked to the final user since that 11 tons of commingled
U.S.-Canadian wheat would not be eligible for use in Government-assisted export programs. If the commingled lot
were further blended with another 19 tons, and then split into two separate lots of 15 tons_the identifying paperwork
would have to accompany both lots through the rest of the marketing chain. To make this alternative work, ASCS would
have to be able to require that the identity of the commingled grain be preserved on all commercial sales documents,
such as invoices and bills of lading, from the first point where the U.S. and Canadian grain is commingled through each
subsequent sale, i.e., from the point of commingling through the remainder of the U.S. marketing chain to the processor,
feedlot, brewer, distiller, or exporter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) ASCS could implement an ``identity preservation'' system_an end-use certificate system that preserves the
identity and origin of the commodity as it moves through each step of the marketing chain by requiring separate handling
and storage. Only the end-user, such as a flour miller, would be allowed to commingle U.S. and imported commodities.
Of course, if the flour were being purchased by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for use in a Government-assisted
program, domestic origin requirements would prevail subjecting the miller to compliance reviews by ASCS. This alternative
would give a high level of assurance that Canadian grain was not entering the U.S. Government-assisted programs and
provide large amounts of information on quantity and quality of Canadian grain entering the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Current ASCS Rules and Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any end-use certificate system should be designed to supplement or broaden the use of current ASCS rules and policies
used to procure commodities for donation or sale under the Food for Progress, Pub. L. 480 Titles II and III, and section
416(b) foreign food assistance programs, as well as for domestic food assistance programs. Under these programs,
the physical commingling of U.S. origin grain with non-U.S. origin grain is allowed provided that at the time of delivery
to CCC the grain merchant has a sufficient quantity and quality of U.S. origin grain available at the location where
loading occurred to account for the grain sold to CCC. The grain merchant's accounting records and supporting documents
must demonstrate such availability and reduction in the stocks of U.S. origin grain. ASCS monitors the compliance
of CCC's contractors through the selection and review of a number of contracts each quarter. The domestic origin reviews
are performed by the Kansas City Commodity Office, ASCS. It is the responsibility of the CCC contractor to adequately
maintain documents to establish the origin of the commodity. Failure of CCC's contractors to establish or otherwise
maintain adequate records which verify the U.S. origin of the commodity or product delivered to CCC may be cause for
suspension or debarment from bidding on future CCC contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is ASCS' intent that costs associated with verifying end-use certificate compliance will be borne by entities
importing the grain. Such costs will likely be assessed at the time of issuance of each end-use certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many variations of the aforementioned alternatives are possible. ASCS invites interested persons to submit written

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions
of the Texas milk marketing order. The proposal would suspend a portion of the producer definition until such time
as this and other pooling provisions of the order can be reviewed at a public hearing. The action was requested by Associated
Milk Producers, Inc., a cooperative that represents dairy farmers whose milk is pooled under the order. Proponent
contends that these provisions prevent the cooperative from marketing its milk supplies efficently.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers
would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the suspension
of the following provisions (or sections) of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Texas marketing area
is being considered until this and other pooling provisions of the Texas order are reviewed at a public hearing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;1126.12, paragraph (b)(5) in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons who want to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of their views to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the

Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would suspend the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions of the Texas milk order (Order 126).
By suspending these provisions, the milk of dairy farmers who were not associated with the Texas market in September-November
could be used to supply Order 126 distributing plants during the following months of February-July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its letter requesting the suspension, Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), stated that these provisions are
now preventing the cooperative from marketing its milk supplies efficiently. Because of the limitation on which
dairy farmers can be producers under the Texas order during the months of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February-July, AMPI was unable to pool more than two million pounds of milk it supplied to an Order 126 distributing
plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, during February 1994. The milk of these dairy farmers, who are more favorably located
with respect to the Little Rock plant than are the cooperative's Texas producers, was not eligible for pool status
because the dairy farmers had not been associated with the Texas market to the extent necessary during the preceding
months of September-November. If AMPI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies the Arkansas plant with milk of eligible Texas producers, the cooperative suffers an economic pooling loss
because the Little Rock plant is subject to a minus 39-cent location adjustment, proponent states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proponent also claims that the market's supply/demand relationship has changed dramatically since these provisions
were adopted. Because of these circumstances, AMPI asks that the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions be
suspended until the appropriateness of this and other pooling provisions for this market can be explored at a public
hearing.

The Commission's regulations currently require that each licensee conduct an independent audit of its emergency
preparedness program by personnel who have no direct responsibility for the subject areas at least every 12 months.

Petitioner's Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia Power requests that the NRC amend its regulations to require that each licensee conduct, at a minimum, a biennial,
rather than annual, independent audit of its emergency preparedness program. The petitioner states that, if warranted
by performance, the resources previously dedicated to the conduct of mandatory audits in this area could now be more
effectively used to address performance issues of safety significance. The petitioner indicates that audit functions
concerning emergency preparedness would in turn become more performance-based rather than schedule-driven according
to the present annual requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner notes that this request is consistent with the recommendation of the NRC Regulatory Review Group Summary
and Overview Report (August 31, 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the changes requested are identified as present requirements which are resource intensive
but of marginal importance to safety. The petitioner offers the following reasons for the request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The underlying purpose of the existing rule is to ensure the continued emergency preparedness program effectiveness
in taking the required actions necessary to provide for the health and safety of the public in the event of plant emergencies.
This can be readily attained by a more performance-based approach to emergency preparedness overview. The frequency
of audits need not be set on an annual basis if performance warrants a different frequency. The proposed rule provides
for a nominal frequency of 24 months based on existing performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Industry performance to date indicates excellent implementation and effective emergency preparedness programs.
Industry-wide SALP ratings for emergency preparedness have improved from an average of 2.29 in 1980 to 1.26 in 1992.
A two-year audit schedule would permit the licensee an increased degree of flexibility to concentrate available
audit resources in areas of observed weakness based on performance rather than conducting a mandatory annual audit
of marginal safety significance.

3. The existing requirement to conduct an annual audit is not of itself necessary to achieve the underlying purpose
of 10 CFR 50.54(t). Performance-based overview with a two-year maximum interval is sufficient and the proposed rule
does not preclude an increased audit frequency if performance warrants. Based on the existing performance within
the industry, biennial audits represent an acceptable minimum frequency.

4. The proposed rulemaking is philosophically consistent with the recommendations concerning audits of programs
such as Fitness for Duty included in the NRC Regulatory Review Group Summary and Overview (Final) issued in August
1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Regulatory Guide 1.33, Quality Assurance Program Requirements (Operation), prescribes a two-year audit frequency
for most operational phase activities commensurate with the activity's operational safety significance. As emergency
preparedness programs serve to ensure the proper operation of each facility, so the audits of these programs serve
to monitor program effectiveness. The proposed rule is consistent with this previously defined regulatory position
and the present safety significance as evidenced by industry performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Granting the proposed rule to reduce the frequency of audits based on continued good performance is warranted based
on the present good performance of industry plans and programs, the documented trend of identifying fewer significant
issues associated with emergency preparedness audits, and by virtue of meeting the intent of the regulations in the
balance of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Consideration of relaxing this requirement is warranted in light of the completion and implementation of enhanced
emergency equipment and systems, the continuing rise in the level of industry proficiency and performance, and the
increased industry sensitivity to emergency preparedness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The existing requirements to conduct annual audits are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not of themselves necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of Appendix E to 10 CFR part 50. Biennial audits are sufficient
to provide an acceptable formal confirmation of program effectiveness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that emergency preparedness programs throughout the industry are designed to achieve and
maintain an adequate level of emergency response capability and that required audits are conducted to ascertain
the effective implementation of the basic elements existing within emergency preparedness plans and organizations.
The petitioner states that the audit process is designed to ensure and confirm the ability to respond properly to an
emergency condition. According to the petitioner, the intent of the petition for rulemaking would be to verify that
an acceptable level of emergency preparedness is attained and maintained consistent with each approved program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that in addition to the audits, onsite and offsite graded exercises also serve as a direct assessment
of program effectiveness. The petitioner notes that this petition for rulemaking complements the petition for rulemaking
published on March 4, 1993 (58 FR 12339), concerning modification of the requirement to change the exercise emergency
plans from annual to biennial. The petitioner indicates that the audit and exercise can alternate yearly as the formal
means to verify program effectiveness and that neither action precludes additional audits if performance trends
indicate additional overview is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that because audits indicate to management where additional attention and resources might
be needed based on performance trends, excellent performance could also indicate where less attention and resources
are required. Therefore, the petitioner believes that based on industry's performance, annual audits of emergency
preparedness programs are no longer commensurate with any safety benefit derived by the audit function.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the existing rule is not necessary to ensure an adequate emergency preparedness program.
It provides an overview to direct management attention and resources to observed performance deficiencies. The
petitioner indicates that the proposed rule would continue to require an adequate minimum provision for program
overview based on existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry performance. Therefore, the petitioner believes that annual audits are no longer commensurate with the
benefit gained based on the commendable performance by the industry in this area.

 In general, the Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. HUD will not sell delinquent
mortgages, however, if foreclosure is unavoidable, and the project securing the mortgage is occupied by low-income
tenants who are not receiving housing assistance but would do so under section 203 of the Housing and Community Development
Amendments of 1978 if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage. In addition, mortgages on subsidized properties will only
be sold with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant protections; mortgages
for unsubsidized projects may be sold without FHA insurance.

A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Housing and Urban Development's inventory of project mortgages is large and growing. The Office
of Management and Budget acknowledged this development by designating multifamily property and loan disposition
as a High Risk Area. To reduce losses to the FHA fund, to decrease its inventory of project mortgages, to improve the
servicing of these mortgages, and to improve the rental services provided by properties securing its insured and
HUD-held mortgages, HUD is proposing to resume the sale of multifamily project mortgages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's inventory of mortgages has grown significantly since mortgage sales stopped in FY 1985. As of August 1993, HUD
held over 2,400 project mortgages in inventory. (In comparison, HUD's inventory of mortgages totaled 2300 at the
end of FY 1991, 1600 at the end of FY 1989, and 1400 at the end of FY 1987.) In August of 1993, approximately 1,100 HUD-held
multifamily residential mortgages with unpaid principal balances (UPBs) of $1.5 billion were current and 1,200
with UPBs of $5.6 billion were delinquent. Approximately 874 current mortgages (80 percent of current mortgages)
and 310 delinquent mortgages (25 percent of delinquent mortgages) were subsidized. Current mortgages included
nearly 400 mortgages assigned under Section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act that were current at the time of
assignment. Delinquent mortgages included nearly 300 formerly coinsured mortgages. In addition, the HUD-held
inventory included 44 nursing home mortgages with UPBs of about $170 million and 10 hospital mortgages with UPBs of
about $110 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the FY 1992 FHA Audit Report, HUD increased its loss reserves to $11.9 billion for its $43.6 billion of multifamily
insurance in force. One of the aims of HUD's mortgage sales program is to reduce these projected losses by increasing
the number of mortgages returned to current status and increasing returns to the Federal Government through mortgage
sales.

B. General Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department will only sell subsidized mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant
protections. The Department may sell unsubsidized mortgages with or without mortgage insurance. In addition, the
Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. The Department will not sell delinquent mortgages
that it believes cannot be worked out if the projects securing the mortgages are occupied by low-income tenants who
are not receiving rental assistance but who would be eligible to receive rental assistance under section 203 of the
Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 (HCDA of 1978) if the mortgages were foreclosed upon by HUD.
The Department will sell delinquent mortgages on such projects that it believes can be worked out. While the Department
would not expect it to be needed, purchasers of such mortgages would retain the option of foreclosure because the ability
to foreclose facilitates work-out activity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 203(i)(2) of the HCDA of 1978, a subsidized mortgage is defined by this rule as a mortgage
on a project which receives assistance under any of the following programs: (1) The section 221(d)(3) Below Market
Interest Rate loan program; (2) the section 236 Interest Reduction Payment program, (3) a direct loan with below market
interest rates made under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, section 401 and 404(b)(3) of the Housing Act of 1950,
or section 312 of the Housing Act of 1964; (4) the section 101 Rent Supplement payments program; and (5) Housing assistance
payments under section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 in effect before January 1, 1975, or section 8 of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937. Housing assistance payments under the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (24 CFR part 882, subparts
A, B, C and F), and the Section 8 Rental Voucher program (24 CFR part 887) are excluded in determining whether a project
is a subsidized rental housing project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unsubsidized mortgages include mortgages on projects where rents are partially or wholly subject to market determination
rather than regulation by HUD. Unsubsidized projects include those projects insured under: (a) Section 207, Multifamily
Rental Housing; (b) Section 213, Cooperatives; (c) Section 220, Urban Renewal; (d) Section 221(d)(3), Market Rate
with Limited Dividend Mortgagors and without Rent Supplement or project-based Section 8; (e) Section 221(d)(4),
Market Rate, Moderate Income Families; (f) Section 231, Elderly Housing with Profit-motivated Mortgagors; (g)
Section 232, Nursing Homes and Intermediate Care Facilities with Profit-Motivated Mortgagors; (h) Section 241,
Supplemental Mortgages; (i) Section 242, Hospitals with any profit motivated mortgagors and all nonprofit mortgagors
with mortgages for which an insurance commitment was issued on or after June 16, 1988; and (j) Section 608, Veteran
Housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, unsubsidized mortgages are not subject to prepayment restrictions. However, there are some unsubsidized
mortgages which contain moderate prepayment restrictions. Some of these mortgages contained prepayment restrictions
primarily because their original non-profit mortgagors received more favorable financing terms. HUD permitted
prepayment only with permission of the FHA Commissioner in an effort to prevent for-profit mortgagors from using
non-profit mortgagors as agents to secure the more favorable financing terms. HUD generally granted approval to
prepay upon request if no fraud was evident. Since the potential for fraud occurred at the time of origination, by the
time of assignment, the need for the prepayment restriction no longer exists. Having approved prepayment liberally
while the mortgages were insured, HUD has no need to continue prepayment restrictions following assignment when
the rationale for the restriction no longer applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mortgages with moderate prepayment restrictions of this type were insured under: (a) Section 221(d)(3) Market Rate
with non-profit mortgagors and with no Rent Supplement or Section 8 Assistance; (b) Section 231, Housing for the Elderly
with Non-profit Mortgagors (Public and Private); (c) Section 232, Nursing Homes and Intermediate Care Facilities
with Non-profit Mortgagors; (d) Section 242, Hospitals with Nonprofit Mortgagors, where a commitment was issued
prior to June 16, 1988; and (e) Title XI, Group Practice Facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mortgages insured under section 207/223(f), Purchase/Refinancing of Existing Multifamily Projects, also contain
moderate prepayment restrictions if the commitment was issued after October 8, 1980. For these mortgages, during
the five years following final endorsement for insurance, prepayment is permitted only with permission of the FHA
Commissioner. The Department has used and continues to use this prepayment restriction to prevent use of the FHA-insured
mortgage as bridge financing to facilitate condominium conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because mortgages with moderate prepayment restrictions are not subsidized mortgages, this rule would authorize
HUD to sell these mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed rule, mortgages on formerly coinsured projects without project-based Section 8 assistance
could be sold without insurance because the projects covered by the mortgages were not subsidized and did not have
prepayment restrictions (except for lock-out periods permitted for certain bond-financed mortgages).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sale with FHA mortgage insurance is an uncomplicated way to return mortgage ownership and servicing to the private
sector. HUD's policies regarding the regulation and monitoring of insured mortgages are well developed and well
known in the housing industry. More importantly, however, section 203(h)(1) of the HCDA of 1978 prohibits the Secretary
from selling any mortgage held by the Secretary on any subsidized project unless the project will continue to operate
in a manner which provides rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms
of the program under which the mortgage was insured prior to the assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary. Selling
mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance ensures that existing and future tenants will continue to enjoy the benefits
of the original subsidized housing program, while avoiding the need to create alternative methods of providing the
tenant protections that the original subsidized housing program provided. Such alternative methods would entail
complicated financing and servicing mechanisms (as in the case of a bare legal title sale) or the cooperation of the
mortgagor (as in the case of deed restrictions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FHA mortgage insurance facilitates provision of private capital. Private investors and servicers
have expressed interest in acquiring mortgages in HUD's portfolio. With mortgage insurance to offset almost all
of the risk, private lenders and investors would be willing to purchase multifamily housing mortgages at a higher
price, while HUD collects mortgage insurance premiums to protect the Government in the event of loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to 1984, HUD enjoyed a low financial default rate on mortgages sold with insurance. HUD sold 236 mortgages, with
mortgage balances totalling $409.6 million, with insurance under section 207 pursuant to section 223(c) in the period
between 1967 and 1984. Of these mortgages, 95 (with UPBs of $233.3 million) continue to be insured, 128 are no longer
insured as a consequence of repayments, prepayments, or voluntary terminations of insurance. Only 13 were ever re-assigned
to HUD, triggering the payment of a claim, a default rate of six percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the sale of mortgages with insurance has numerous advantages, it also has some disadvantages. Sale of mortgages
with FHA mortgage insurance requires HUD to budget a credit subsidy. Moreover, the sale of mortgages with FHA mortgage
insurance continues HUD's responsibility to regulate the relationship between the mortgagee and the mortgagor.
Regulation leads to expenditure of government staff time and money that could be devoted to other purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selling mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance is also consistent with government-wide efforts to increase Federal
collections, reduce regulation in favor of competition, use Federal Government personnel more efficiently, and
return functions to the private sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, selling mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance is compatible with the objectives of the National Housing
Act which formulates the goal of ``a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,'' since
projects should continue to provide decent and suitable housing without having a mortgage insured by FHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenants in unsubsidized projects with current mortgages would not be disadvantaged if their project mortgages are
sold without FHA mortgage insurance because, with some limitations, owners of unsubsidized projects may prepay
their mortgages without HUD approval at any time. Similarly, these owners (with the approval of their mortgagees)
may voluntarily terminate their FHA mortgage insurance. Under current conditions, prepayment and voluntary termination
are likely to occur when owners refinance existing mortgages to take advantage of lower interest rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since HUD regulation of these projects can be terminated at any time, tenants in these projects would be provided rental
housing on terms no less advantageous than those under which the original mortgage was insured prior to assignment,
and they would be no more likely to suffer displacement. In addition, low-income tenants in projects with project-based
section 8 assistance could continue to receive the section 8 assistance under existing contracts, even if the mortgage
is no longer insured. This is because, subject to appropriations, it is current HUD policy to grant extensions of project-based
section 8 contracts without regard to the status of the mortgage. Under this rule, HUD would require that purchasers
of mortgages agree not to induce any project owner to terminate a project-based section 8 assistance contract, and,
in the event of foreclosure, to assume any section 8 contract. Moreover, if an owner terminates the section 8 contract,
it is current HUD policy, that, subject to appropriations, all eligible tenants would receive section 8 certificates
or vouchers. Low-income tenants in projects without project-based section 8 could apply for certificates or vouchers
from their local public housing authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this rule, HUD would only sell mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance to HUD-approved mortgagees. However,
this rule would allow HUD to sell mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance without such a restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mortgages sold with FHA mortgage insurance would be covered by the Multifamily Mortgage Foreclosure Act, which permits
HUD to require, as a condition and term of the foreclosure sale, that the purchaser agree to continue to operate the
property in accordance with the terms of the original FHA mortgage insurance program. Mortgages sold with FHA insurance
and subsequently foreclosed upon would also be subject to the property management and disposition provisions of
section 203 of the HCDA of 1978 which provide for the preservation, in whole or part, of HUD-owned projects for low-
and moderate-income persons. To guard against windfall profits by a mortgagee from the default of an insured mortgage
purchased at a discount, HUD would limit insurance proceeds.

C. Sale of Delinquent Mortgages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to selling current (i.e., performing) mortgages, under this rule HUD would sell some delinquent (i.e.,
nonperforming) unsubsidized mortgages to investors who would assume the responsibility for bringing the mortgages
current, modifying them, refinancing the property, or foreclosing the mortgage. Under the proposed rule, HUD would
not sell mortgages that it would normally foreclose upon; i.e., those mortgages with incurable defaults which are
secured by projects occupied by low-income tenants not currently receiving rental subsidies but who would be eligible
to receive rental assistance under section 203 of the HCDA of 1978 if the mortgages were foreclosed upon by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loan restructuring is more desirable than foreclosure from both HUD's and the tenants' points of view. In foreclosure,
projects undergo long periods of uncertainty, and may suffer from physical decline because owners lack an economic
incentive to invest in improvements, and from management problems as owners focus attention on economically viable
activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the present time, however, HUD lacks sufficient staff capacity to restructure a large number of loans. By selling
delinquent loans, HUD would transfer restructuring responsibility to private purchasers who could swiftly and
aggressively restore projects to economic health and stability. Many more tenants would benefit from swift resolution
of loan delinquencies than from foreclosure, and for this reason, HUD proposes to sell nonperforming loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three broad groups of delinquent mortgages suitable for sale: (1) Formerly coinsured mortgages, (2) mortgages
on non-residential property, such as nursing homes, and (3) other unsubsidized mortgages. For formerly coinsured
mortgages, it was never intended that HUD would become the holder of the mortgage or the owner of the project in the event
of default. Under the coinsurance program, coinsuring lenders originally were responsible for foreclosing defaulted
project mortgages and acquiring and disposing of the underlying properties. However, HUD agreed to convert coinsured
mortgages to full insurance where the coinsuring lender issued GNMA mortgage-backed securities, subsequently
defaulted on its obligations, and was taken over by GNMA. HUD's agreement to convert coinsured loans backed by GNMA
mortgage securities to fully insured loans accounts for the formerly coinsured loans that are now in the HUD-held
inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low-income tenants in formerly coinsured projects with HUD-held mortgages are now potentially eligible for assistance
should HUD foreclose the mortgage or acquire and sell the property. However, most projects with coinsured mortgages
were built for market-rate occupancy. As with formerly insured mortgages, the Department would not sell those delinquent
coinsured mortgages that it believes cannot avoid foreclose_i.e., those that have large unresolvable delinquencies,
if those properties are occupied by low-income tenants not currently receiving rental subsidies who would do so under
section 203 of the HCDA of 1978 if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-residential properties, such as nursing homes, do not have landlord-tenant relationships and do not qualify
for subsidy protection under Section 203. Loans on these properties are particularly suitable for a sale, because
workout and renegotiation of these mortgages requires a range of specialized skills and knowledge not widely possessed
by HUD staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, while some unsubsidized mortgages will continue to be foreclosed and the property sold by HUD, many unsubsidized
mortgages will be sold in periodic sales in order more quickly and effectively to reinstate, refinance, or modify
the mortgages and return the projects to stable operating condition. As noted above, the projects covered by unsubsidized
mortgages to be sold would be occupied by tenants already paying market rate rental. Since projects would continue
to be governed by market conditions following private mortgage restructuring, mortgage sales would be unlikely
to result in involuntary tenant displacement.

D. Sale of Subsidized Mortgages to State Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to selling mortgages to private investors and FHA-approved mortgagees, HUD will consider selling subsidized
HUD-held mortgages to interested State and local governments on a negotiated basis. Section 203(h)(3) of the HCDA
of 1978 authorizes negotiated sales to State or local governments, or a group of investors which includes an agency
of a State or local government provided that: (1) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government,
or agency of same to act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage, and ensure that the project will
maintain occupancy by the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program; and (2)
the sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government, while maintaining
occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning
and Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is
available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.

C. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. Specifically,
the requirements of this rule are directed to HUD, and do not impinge upon the relationship between Federal government
and State and local governments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. This rule will not affect the ability of small entities, relative to larger entities, to bid for and
acquire HUD-held mortgages that HUD determines to sell.

The purpose of this subpart is to set forth HUD's policy regarding the sale of subsidized and unsubsidized HUD-held
mortgages.

Sale of Subsidized HUD-Held Mortgages. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's policy for selling subsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) HUD will sell current mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance on a competitive basis to FHA-approved mortgagees;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) HUD will sell current mortgages on a negotiated basis to State or local governments, or a group of investors which
includes an agency of a State or local government if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government, or agency of same to act as mortgagee
or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage, and ensure that the project will maintain occupancy by the tenant
group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government, while
maintaining occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) HUD will sell current mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance if HUD can offer protections equivalent to an insured
sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD will sell delinquent mortgages only if as part of the sales transaction those mortgages are restructured and
either FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent protections are provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's policy for selling unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) HUD will sell current unsubsidized mortgages with or without FHA mortgage insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) HUD will sell delinquent unsubsidized mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) HUD will not sell delinquent mortgages if it believes that foreclosure is unavoidable, and the project securing
the mortgage is occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance but would do so if HUD foreclosed
upon the mortgage.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) History of NPSL Accounting Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A chronology of the NPSL rules follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;May 30, 1980_before Congress passes the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), 30 U.S.C.,
1701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_the Department of Energy (DOE) publishes regulations on accounting procedures for offshore NPSL's (10 CFR part
390).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;December 1981_the Secretary of the Interior receives authority to administer the NPSL rules (Pub. L. 97&hyph;100).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;January 11, 1983 (48 FR 1182)_NPSL rules transferred to the Department of the Interior (Department), MMS,
and redesignated 30 CFR part 261.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;August 5, 1983_30 CFR part 261 is redesignated 30 CFR part 220 (48 FR 35642).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Current and Original Rules Compared
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other than minor administrative changes, MMS' version of the NPSL accounting rules in 30 CFR part 220 duplicates DOE's
original rules in 10 CFR part 390. Both provide that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ledger cards showing charges and credits to the NPSL capital account must be maintained for 36 months after
the lessee ceases NPSL operations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All other documents, journals, and records must be maintained for 36 months from the due date or date of mailing
of the statement of account on an NPSL, whichever comes later;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department has the right to start an audit any time within 36 months of the due date of the statement to be audited
or the date it was mailed, whichever is later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) NPSL vs. FOGRMA Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record maintenance periods in the NPSL rules conflict with current statutory record maintenance requirements
on all Federal and Indian oil and gas leases, including leases on the OCS. Section 103 of FOGRMA, 30 U.S.C. 1713, ``Required
Recordkeeping,'' states, in part that a lessee, operator, or other person *&blank;*&blank;* shall establish and
maintain any records, make any reports, and provide any information that the Secretary may, by rule, reasonably require
*&blank;*&blank;*. Upon the request of any officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary or any State or Indian
tribe *&blank;*&blank;* the appropriate records, reports, or information *&blank;*&blank;* shall be made available
for inspection and duplication by such officer or employee, State, or Indian tribe. Records *&blank;*&blank;* shall
be maintained for 6 years *&blank;*&blank;* unless the Secretary notifies the record holder that he has initiated
an audit *&blank;*&blank;* and that such records must be maintained for a longer period. In any case when an audit or
investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until the Secretary releases the record holder of the obligation
to maintain such records.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(5) of FOGRMA, 30 U.S.C. 1702, defines the term ``lease'' to include ``any *&blank;*&blank;* profit share
arrangement *&blank;*&blank;* issued or approved by the United States under a mineral leasing law that authorizes
exploration for, extraction of, or removal of oil or gas.'' So, FOGRMA applies to NPSL records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) General MMS Recordkeeping Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MMS issued regulations at 30 CFR 212.50, ``Required recordkeeping and reports,'' after FOGRMA's enactment.
They state in part that all records *&blank;*&blank;* shall be maintained *&blank;*&blank;* for 6 years *&blank;*&blank;*
unless the recordholder is notified, in writing, that records must be maintained for a longer period. When an audit
or investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until the recordholder is released by written notice of
the obligation to maintain records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of MMS regulations at 30 CFR 212.51, ``Records and files maintenance,'' state in part that each
lessee *&blank;*&blank;* shall make and retain accurate and complete records necessary to demonstrate that payments
of rentals, royalties, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
net profit shares
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and other payments related to offshore and onshore Federal and Indian oil and gas leases are in compliance with lease
terms, regulations, and orders *&blank;*&blank;*. Lessees *&blank;*&blank;* required to keep records under this
section shall maintain and preserve them for 6 years *&blank;*&blank;* unless the Secretary notifies the recordholder
of an audit *&blank;*&blank;* and that they must be maintained for a longer period. When an audit or investigation
is underway, records shall be maintained until the recordholder is released in writing from the obligation to maintain
the records *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, part 212 specifically requires that NPSL records be maintained at least 6 years after generation. Under &sect;212.50,
this period may be longer if the recordholder is notified in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) Who Is Responsible for NPSL Reporting?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The June 11, 1981, Notice to Lessees for Implementation of Net Profit Share Accounting for OCS Oil and Gas Leases, 46
FR 30897, clarifies NPSL reporting responsibilities. It states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The designated NPSL operator must meet the reporting requirements of 30 CFR 390.031 (1980) (now 30 CFR 220.031
(1992)) for all lease interest holders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Until production starts, each operator must file an annual report by 60 days after the lease anniversary date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After production starts, a monthly report must be filed and payments made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each operator is responsible for making NPSL payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the MMS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oil and Gas Payor Handbook
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, vol. II, section 3.3.8, states that NPSL operators must file a Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (Form MMS&hyph;2014)
monthly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) First Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1990, MMS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 23248). The MMS proposed to amend the FOGRMA implementation requirement at 30 CFR 220.030 to make its recordkeeping
requirements the same as FOGRMA's and those of 30 CFR 212.50 and 212.51. The MMS proposed the changes because the NPSL
accounting procedures predate and conflict with FOGRMA and MMS' general recordkeeping rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MMS also proposed to delete 30 CFR 220.033 because 30 CFR 217.50 already applies to all oil and gas audits, including
NPSL's. The MMS is preparing separately a proposed rulemaking to revise 30 CFR part 217, Audits and Inspections; NPSL
audit requirements will be included in that rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
(g) Agreements With Operators
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
After MMS published the proposed rule, it signed agreements with over half of the existing NPSL operators. Under these
agreements operators can either supply NPSL records directly to MMS or maintain them until MMS completes a lease audit.
All who signed the agreement opted to maintain the records themselves rather than send them to MMS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
II. Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The June 1990 proposed rule would have assured consistency between the NPSL rules and FOGRMA by putting the FOGRMA
6-year recordkeeping requirements in the NPSL rules. But, given the audit needs described in paragraph IV below,
MMS concluded that a modified approach was needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The main thrust of this revised proposed rule parallels the recordkeeping agreements now in place between MMS and
a majority of NPSL operators. Because of this substantial change from the June 1990 proposed rule, MMS is publishing
this revised proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public review and comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MMS received comments from one industry respondent on the June 1990 proposed rulemaking. Those comments were
considered in this revised proposed rulemaking; they are discussed in paragraph III below. The revised proposed
rule is summarized and discussed in paragraph IV below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Comments Received on June 1990 Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The June 1990 proposed rule provided for a 30-day public comment period ending July 9, 1990. We received comments from
one industry source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The commenter felt a period longer than 30 days should be allowed for comments on the proposed rulemaking. They
felt MMS had ample time since FOGRMA's enactment to make the proposed amendment, and to allow only a 30-day comment
period was not justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MMS Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MMS received comments from only one source, and no one else asked for more time. Thus, MMS believes the 30-day comment
period was long enough for all interested parties to reply to the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The commenter said the amendments must be prospective from the effective date of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MMS Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 305 of FOGRMA states that the provisions of this Act shall apply to oil and gas leases issued before, on, or after
the date of the enactment of this Act, except that in the case of a lease issued before such date, no provision of this
Act or any rule or regulation prescribed under this Act shall alter the express and specific provisions of such a lease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since NPSL lease terms do not include time periods for keeping records, NPSL's have been subject to FOGRMA's requirements
as a matter of law since its enactment in 1983. Thus, the proposed changes would not be ``retroactive.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The commenter said there were a number of leases issued under the initial regulations_i.e., 10 CFR 390.030, 390.033,
and 390.034, now unchanged at 30 CFR 220.030, 220.033, and 220.034_but after enactment of FOGRMA section 103, and
these leases must be grandfathered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MMS Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, section 103 of FOGRMA applies to all NPSL's; section 305 is clear on this point. The fact that some
NPSL's were issued while the initial regulations were in effect, but after FOGRMA's enactment, has no bearing on the
applicability of section 305 or the section 103 recordkeeping requirements. Statutory requirements always supersede
inconsistent regulatory obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The commenter did not agree that &sect;220.033, Audits, should be removed in favor of &sect;217.50. The commenter
gave no reasons for this objection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MMS Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MMS proposed to delete &sect;220.033 to clarify that NPSL audits will be subject to procedures already described
in 30 CFR part 217. The MMS is preparing a proposed rulemaking to revise 30 CFR part 217; it will address NPSL audits.
There is no need to duplicate the NPSL audit requirements in &sect;220.033.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Summary of Revised Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Need for Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This revised proposed rulemaking amends &sect;220.030 to clarify that the minimum period for maintaining records
on NPSL's, like all other lease subject to FOGRMA, is 6 years after record creation. In some cases lessees create NPSL
cost records, but production may not start for several more years; thus an MMS audit logically may not start for more
than 6 years past first record creation. Although the audit may not begin before production starts or before long cost
accrual periods pass, all costs accumulated in the NPSL capital account after lease issuance affect the account balance
in later periods. Thus, unlike leases where production costs do not affect royalties, NPSL records need long-term
maintenance so MMS can properly verify the capital account balance at the start of any period.

(b) MMS Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To preserve the required records until an audit begins, MMS proposes that the current NPSL operator furnish all records
on the NPSL capital account to the Deputy Associate Director for Audit as they are created, on an annual basis. Or, the
operator could sign an agreement to maintain the records for 6 years after cessation of operations and provide them
for audit as needed. Then the operator would keep the records until notified by MMS that they are no longer needed. The
MMS already has signed such agreements with a majority of the current NPSL operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require the operator to provide MMS all NPSL capital account records the operator now holds
that are older than 6 years_unless the operator agrees, in writing, to maintain them and furnish them to MMS on request.
Also, &sect;220.031(c) would be changed to clarify NPSL reporting and payment requirements. Lastly, the existing
&sect;220.033 would be removed and &sect;220.034 revised and redesignated as a new &sect;220.033.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule is needed to conform regulations to existing statutory requirements. The Department has determined that
this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).

(b) The Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act, 30 U.S.C. 1713, requires that NPSL records be maintained for 6 years
after they are generated unless the Secretary or designee notifies the record holder that an audit or investigation
involving such records has begun, and that they must be kept longer. Because NPSL audits or investigations may not
start within 6 years of lease record creation, the NPSL operator must provide records under either paragraph (b)(1)
or (b)(2):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The current NPSL operator must provide MMS all the NPSL capital account records annually through the end of lease
operations. The first records must be supplied within [60 days following the final rule's effective date], or, for
new operators, within 60 days of the date they become the new operator; all NPSL records created up to that time, except
any provided earlier, must be included. Following the initial submission the operator must submit records each calendar
year through cessation of operations by January 31 of the year following the end of the calendar year. The records must
be mailed to the Minerals Management Service, Royalty Management Program, Deputy Associate Director for Audit,
P.O. Box 25165, Denver, Colorado 80225&hyph;0165; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current NPSL operator may sign an agreement with MMS to maintain records on the NPSL capital account for 6 years
after cessation of operations and make them available to MMS for audit or investigation on request. This signed agreement
must be received by MMS on or before the date the initial records must be supplied under paragraph (b)(1) of this section,
and submitted to MMS at the address under paragraph (b)(1). Under the agreement, records must be kept until an audit
or investigation is completed and the Director releases the recordholder from maintaining the records. But, if other
sources later show evidence of possible fraud, collusion, or underpayments, MMS may further examine records and
transactions of earlier audit periods.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is considering a proposal to establish a safety zone for the purpose
of the third annual Maryland ``Swim For Life'', at the request of the Maryland ``Swim For Life'' Committee of Baltimore,
Maryland. The ``Swim For Life'' event will consist of a two and a one half mile swim to be held at the Hammerman area of
Gunpowder Falls State Park, Gunpowder River, Maryland. The Swim will start at Hammerman area beach number five, to
the Maxwell Point buoy, thence to Oliver Point buoy and thence to Hammerman area beach numbers one and two. The safety
zone is necessary to control small craft and recreational vessel traffic, and to provide for the safety of life and
property on U.S. navigable waters from the hazards associated with this swimming event. Entry into this zone is prohibited
unless authorized by the Captain of the Port.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In November, 1993, an application was received by U.S. Coast Guard Group Baltimore from the Maryland Swim For Life
Committee, requesting a safety zone for the ``Swim For Life'' event. This event is to be held in the Hammerman area of
Gunpowder Falls State Park, Gunpowder River, Maryland, on June 18, 1994. As part of their application, the ``Swim
For Life'' Committee requested the Coast Guard provide control of spectator and commercial traffic during the swimming
event.

Discussion of Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of spectator craft, recreational vessels as well as swimmers participating
in the event, and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters during the event. Since the
Gunpowder Falls river will not be closed for an extended period, vessel traffic should not be severely disrupted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Drafting Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The drafters of this regulation are Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, project officer for the Captain of the Port,
Baltimore, Maryland and Lieutenant Monica Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule is not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule
to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the U.S. Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that
your business qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business,
please submit a comment (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rule will economically affect
your business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federalism Assessment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 16, 1994, at 59 FR 7880, the Forest Service published a proposed rule to 36 CFR parts 261 and 262, Prohibitions;
Law Enforcement Support Activities. The Department of Agriculture gave notice that this proposed rule would provide
a comprehensive revision of the acts prohibited on the National Forest System which are enforced by personnel of the
Forest Service. The proposed revisions respond to emerging law enforcement issues, the enactment of new laws, and
the promulgation of new rules that have occurred since the subject rules were last revised. The public comment period
was to expire on April 18, 1994. The public has asked for more time to respond and comment on this proposed rule, therefore,
the Forest Service is extending the public comment period until May 18, 1994.

Bacillus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which was first isolated from faba bean plants growing at Nottingham University School of Agriculture, Sutton Boningham,
United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bacillus subtilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a soil saprophyte found world-wide. Strains of this organism are not generally regarded as human or animal pathogens.
The product is intended to be used as a seed treatment. When applied to seeds, the bacteria colonize the developing
root system, competing with disease organisms which attack roots.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered
in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include an acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity study
in the rat, an acute dermal toxicity study in the rabbit, an acute pulmonary toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat,
an acute intravenous toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat, a primary eye irritation study in the rabbit, and a
delayed contact hypersensitivity study in the guinea pig. These studies were performed on the active ingredient
and the end-use product Gus 376 Concentrate Biological Fungicide. A review of these studies indicated that the biofungicide
was not toxic to test animals when administered via the oral, dermal, intravenous or pulmonary routes. The active
ingredient was not infective or pathogenic for test animals when administered via the oral, pulmonary or intravenous
route. The end-use product produced slight ocular irritation which dissipated within 4 days of dosing. An overall
moderate skin sensitization reaction was noted in the treated guinea pigs 24 to 72 hours following treatment. No reports
of hypersensitivity have been recorded from personnel working with this organism. All of the toxicity studies submitted
are considered acceptable. The toxicity data provided are sufficient to show that there are no foreseeable human
or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the use of the product as a seed treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acceptable daily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition
because the data submitted demonstrated that this biological control agent is not toxic to humans. No enforcement
actions are expected. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposes is not applicable
to this exemption request. This is the first exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for this biofungicide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bacillus subtilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 MBI 600 is considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is sought.
Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment of the exemption will protect the public
health. Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed rule. Comments must bear a notation indicating
the document control number [PP4F4284/R2051]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available
in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch at the Virginia address given above from 8 a.m to 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday, except legal holidays.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes to amend a specific reference in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to provide that the
preproduction certification compliance program described in Appendix 6 to International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) Annex 16 is an acceptable means of compliance with gaseous emission standards. This document also proposes
to amend specific references to add the effective date of Volume II of Annex 16. These proposals respond to public inquiries,
and are intended to ensure that the regulations accurately reflect what was intended by the originally proposed rule.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 232 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue regulations that ensure compliance with all aircraft
emission standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Section 231 of the Act. Those
emission standards are prescribed in 40 CFR part 87. The FAA issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) Number
27 (38 FR 35427, December 28, 1973) to ensure compliance with the aircraft and aircraft engine emission standards
and test procedures issued by the EPA in 40 CFR part 87.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, the FAA proposed to codify SFAR 27 (53 FR 18530, May 23, 1988). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposed
to add part 34 to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The NPRM included proposed &sect;34.71, which stated that
compliance with gaseous emission standards would be shown by comparing the pollutant levels with the applicable
emission standards. Proposed &sect;34.71 also stated that an acceptable means of compliance would be incorporated
by reference in proposed &sect;34.4. Proposed &sect;34.4 referenced the preproduction program described in Appendix
6 to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 16, ``Environmental Protection, Volume II_Aircraft
Engine Emissions, First Edition, June 1981, effective February 18, 1982,'' as an acceptable means of compliance
with &sect;34.71. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August of 1990, the proposal was adopted as part 34, ``Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements for Turbine
Engine Powered Airplanes,'' effective September 10, 1990 (55 FR 32856, August 10, 1990). Part 34 contains all of the
applicable aircraft engine fuel venting and exhaust emission requirements of SFAR 27, and the test procedures specified
under the regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. Section 34.4 was not adopted as proposed, but was ``reserved.''
The FAA had intended to, instead, specifically incorporate in &sect;34.71 the reference to Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex
16; however, the reference to an acceptable means of compliance was inadvertently omitted. In addition, the final
rule did not state the effective date of Volume II of ICAO Annex 16 in several other sections where this cite was referenced.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After part 34 was adopted, the FAA received several requests for clarification of the compliance standards stated
in FAR &sect;34.71; the FAA also received inquires as to why Appendix 6 to Volume II of ICAO Annex 16 was omitted as an
acceptable alternative to testing every engine. Members of the public stated that &sect;&sect;34.4 and 34.71 were
different from those proposed in the NPRM. The FAA recognizes that the final rule, as adopted, caused the confusion.
In responding to the inquires, the FAA has stated that the intent of the 1989 proposal was to accept Appendix 6 as an alternative
means of compliance. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that &sect;&sect;34.71 should be amended to reflect the
intent of the proposal.

Synopsis of the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to revise &sect;34.71 of part 34 of the FAR to state that Appendix 6 to International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) Annex 16, ``Environmental Protection, Volume II_Aircraft Engine Emissions, First Edition,
June 1981, effective February 18, 1982,'' is an acceptable means of compliance with that section. In addition, &sect;&sect;34.64,
34.82, and 34.89 of part 34 would be revised to state that the effective date of Volume II of Annex 16 is February 18, 1982.

Regulatory Impact Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulatory evaluation examines the potential costs and benefits of the proposed rule to amend FAR part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the proposed rule is to insert omissions from the current text for part 34, which was published in August
1990. The omissions include the reference to Appendix 6 to ICAO Annex 16, Environmental Protection, Volume II and
the effective date of ICAO rule. In short, the proposed revisions would correct these omissions by referencing the
preproduction certification compliance program described in Appendix 6 to ICAO Annex 16, Environmental Protection,
Volume II and including the effective date of February 18, 1982, for all references to Volume II of ICAO Annex 16 in part
34.

Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential benefits of this proposed rule ensure that the full intent of final rule for part 34 would be realized,
and will eliminate any confusion caused by the noted omissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential costs of the proposed rule would be zero. No significant adverse consequences have been incurred by
either the public or the FAA as a result of the published error. After publication, however, the FAA's Office of Environment
and Energy was made aware of the error through public inquiry. The proposed amendments would address these inquiries
and prevent future misunderstandings.

International Trade Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule represents a clarifying change and would not impose any costs on either U.S. or foreign operators.
Therefore, a competitive trade advantage would not be incurred by either U.S. operators abroad or foreign operators
in the United States.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is because the proposed rule is clarifying in nature and would
not impose any costs.

Environmental Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule represents a clarifying change and would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.
In addition, pursuant to Department of Transportation, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental
Impacts'' (FAA Order 1050.1D, appendix 7, paragraph 4), the FAA was categorically excluded from providing an environmental
analysis with regard to part 34 because it was mandated by law to issue regulations to ensure compliance with the EPA
aircraft emissions standards, and the EPA has performed all required environmental analyses prior to the issuance
of those standards.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposed rule would
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I certify that the proposed rule: (1) Is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not
a significant rule under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.
