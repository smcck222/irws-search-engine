I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To comply with Executive Order 12699 of January 5, 1990, the DOE initially changed its Financial Assistance Rules
on February 2, 1992. At the time the Rules were amended, the Uniform Building Code was the only code/standard judged
to be ``substantially equivalent'' to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's Recommended Provisions
for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings, 1988 Edition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 4, 1992, the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC), acting in accordance with
E.O. 12699, issued a recommendation to the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) finding that specified
versions of three of the four model building codes reviewed ``provide a level of seismic safety that is substantially
equivalent to the Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings, 1988 Edition
(FEMA 222 and 223)'' (see appendix C of the Guidelines and Procedures for Implementation of the Executive Order on
Seismic Safety of New Building Construction, ICSSC RP 2.1A, NISTIR 4852, June 1992). Following this ``certification,''
the DOE again proposed changes to the Financial Assistance Rules to permit the use of all model building codes found
to be acceptable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When other codes and/or standards are found acceptable, such as the ASCE 7&hyph;93 Standard (for seismic loads),
the DOE will initiate appropriate changes to the Financial Assistance Rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Changes to 10 CFR Part 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 600.12(c) is revised to identify additional building codes which would meet the seismic safety requirements
of the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion of Comments on Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) stated that the DOE should adopt ASCE Standard
7&hyph;93 for seismic loads in the Financial Assistance Rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is unable to adopt the ASCE comment at this time. The ASCE proposal can be considered when ASCE Standard
7&hyph;93 has been found by the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC) to provide a level
of seismic safety that is substantially equivalent to the Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic
Regulations for New Buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASCE comment has been forwarded to the Chairman of the ICSSC of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
for consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Review Under Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for
any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in
the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial
direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions
involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. However, DOE has determined that the revision
will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Regulatory Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164,
which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small
governmental jurisdictions. DOE has concluded that the final rule would only affect small entities as they apply
for and receive financial assistance, and does not create additional economic impact on small entities as a whole.
DOE certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed upon the public by this rulemaking. Accordingly,
no OMB clearance is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., or OMB implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has concluded that promulgation of this final rule clearly would not represent a major Federal action having significant
impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1976)), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and DOE guidelines (10
CFR part 1021) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement pursuant to NEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Review Under Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. DOE certifies that today's final rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.

(c) Provisions shall be made to design and construct all buildings, in which DOE funds are used, to meet appropriate
seismic design and construction standards. Seismic codes and standards meeting or exceeding the provisions of each
of the model codes listed in this paragraph are considered to be appropriate for purposes of this part. The model codes
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 1991 Uniform Building Code, of the International Council of Building Officials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 1992 Supplement to the National Building Code, of the Building Officials and Code Administrators International,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations to incorporate a number of technical and conforming
amendments. The amendments include a global revision to reflect the change from the MACRO to the CAMEL rating system
used by the other federal banking regulatory agencies and a reinstatement of the definition of ``affiliated person''
that was inadvertently removed. The rule also revises OTS's organizational regulations to reflect current titles
and makes technical corrections to provisions concerning bylaws and charter reissuance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS is today adopting several technical amendments to its regulations to implement the new rating system for savings
associations, to reinstate a definitional provision, to update organizational titles and addresses and correct
an erroneous cross-reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

CAMEL Rating System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS is amending its regulations to reflect the conversion from the MACRO to the CAMEL rating system. The purpose
of the conversion is to reduce regulatory burden by using the same rating system employed by the other federal banking
regulatory agencies. The MACRO system currently used by the OTS is very similar to the FDIC's CAMEL policy guidance.
The conversion is intended to improve consistency with regard to risk-based assessments and joint examinations.
The OTS expects there to be virtually no practical effect on savings associations as a result of this change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

The appendix to part 544 which sets forth model bylaws for mutual savings associations is being amended to bring it
into conformity with &sect;544.5(b)(8). The appendix to part 552 containing model bylaws for stock associations
is being revised to bring it into conformity with &sect;552.6&hyph;1(h). A conforming change is also being made to
&sect;552.6(d), based upon the model bylaws contained in the appendix. The provisions undergoing amendment specify
the amount of notice to be given prior to certain meetings of boards of directors and state when voting lists are to be
prepared and how the meetings may be conducted. Section 552.4 concerning charter reissuance is also being revised
to correct an erroneous cross-reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, the OTS has found good cause to dispense with both prior notice and comment on this final rule
and a thirty-day delay of its effective date. OTS believes that it is contrary to public interest to delay the effective
date of the rule, as it brings the OTS's regulations into conformity with the current rating system. The OTS believes
that it is in the best interest of savings associations for the implementing regulations to be amended at the time the
rating system is changed. The other amendments are purely technical corrections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria was applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to extend the time limit allowed to vessel operators to file documentation
submitted in connection with vessel repair entries, including applications for relief from the assessment of duties
under the vessel repair statute. It also amends the regulations to require that any shipyard cost estimates available
be submitted at the time that a vessel repair entry is made. These changes will expedite the decision process in determining

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 13, 1993, a document was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 4114) soliciting comments regarding a Customs proposal to amend the Customs Regulations regarding the time
limit available for the submission of documentation in support of required vessel repair entries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1466 of title 19 of the United States Code provides that a duty of 50 per cent ad valorem shall be assessed upon
the value of repairs accomplished outside of the United States on certain American-flag vessels. The statute itself
and numerous judicial and administrative interpretations provide exceptions to the assessment of duty under specific
circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory mandate is implemented under section 4.14 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.14), which provides
the necessary working guidelines for Customs as well as vessel operators. Among the matters set forth in &sect;4.14
are the procedures for making entry and for seeking administrative refund or remission of assessed duty. It is required
that American-flag vessels submit a vessel repair entry to Customs within 5 days of arrival from a foreign port following
any shipyard work. Depending upon whether actual shipyard invoices are available at the time an entry is submitted,
the regulations provide that such entry may be denominated either a complete or incomplete submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations provide, absent the grant of an extension, that in the case of entries submitted as incomplete accounts,
a full and complete account of foreign shipyard costs incurred must be submitted to Customs within 60 days from the
date of vessel arrival in the United States (19 CFR 4.14(b)(2)(ii)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has long been heard from vessel operators that the matter of final charges is frequently the subject of negotiation
between themselves and foreign shipyards. It was claimed that this process often makes it impossible to meet the regulatory
submission deadline without the necessity of seeking an extension from Customs. Customs had been reluctant to extend
the filing period, recognizing that extending the period for the gathering of all evidence has the inevitable effect
of delaying the eventual collection of the revenue. Customs has come to believe, however, that such a delay already
existed owing to the large number of operators seeking extensions, and that a savings could be realized by not having
to process numerous requests for extension. With publication of the January 13, 1993, notice, Customs proposed extending
the filing period from the 60-day limit to a period of 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, Customs took the opportunity to propose an additional amendment to the vessel repair regulations.
In the case of vessel repair entries submitted as incomplete accounts, Customs requires that the best estimate of
foreign repair costs be provided pending receipt of actual final invoices. Such statements of cost are used to calculate
the amount of the bond or duties that must be deposited with Customs prior to departure of vessels from port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been noted that on some occasions, final invoice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts vary greatly from initially estimated costs, and that the revenue has been inadequately protected by small
deposits or bonds. It is also known that in many cases, written estimates from foreign shipyards have been provided
to vessel operators prior to the commencement of repair operations. Customs merely proposed to require that when
a written estimate has been provided to a vessel operator, documentary evidence of that estimated cost must be filed
at the time of submission of an incomplete vessel repair entry.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five comments were received in response to the proposal. Four were from vessel operators and interested industry
members, and one was from within the Customs Service. A discussion of the specific comments follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The additional time proposed to submit documentation is needed and its addition is welcomed. However, a major and
much more general review of the regulations should be undertaken. As for the proposal to require the submission of
written cost estimates which may be in the possession of a vessel operator, that element should be deleted. Such estimates
are not always accurate and inclusion of this element in the regulations may be interpreted by Customs officers in
the field as a requirement for all vessel entries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs is planning to undertake a total revision of the vessel regulations, to include those governing vessel repair
matters, as soon as practicable. As to the accuracy of written estimates, Customs prefers to have some written benchmark
for establishing cost rather than just a best guess. Further, there are only three Vessel Repair Liquidation Units,
all of which are familiar with and well practiced at applying the Customs Regulations. All three Units are in frequent
contact with Customs Headquarters and thus any interpretive problems could be quickly resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The focus should be on elimination of the 50 per cent duty on foreign repairs to United States vessels. The duty is an
operational and administrative burden to vessel operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comment is non-responsive to the published notice and solicitation of comments. The Customs Service merely enforces
the statute as enacted by the Congress. Any change regarding the amount of the vessel repair duty would require Congressional
action. If repeal of the statute is desired, it would be appropriate to lobby the Congress and not Customs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While in general agreement with the proposal, it should be recognized that the final cost of foreign repairs is invariably
less than the written estimates received from shipyards. It is unfair to liquidate entries 90 days after entry based
upon such high estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the initial filing period, the regulations also provide for a 30-day field-granted filing extension
as well as an additional filing extension of unspecified length to be granted by Customs Headquarters. These combined
periods in addition to the initial 90 days should provide sufficient time to obtain final cost figures upon which liquidation
may be based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The extension to a 90-day filing period is needed and welcomed. In regard to the additional element concerning the
submission of cost estimates, the wording of the proposal should be altered to make it clear that actual estimate documents
need not be submitted, and that only the estimated cost amounts are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs does not expect cost estimates to be obtained by all vessel operators anticipating the filing of vessel entries.
However, to the extent that such documentation already exists, Customs does not believe it to be overly burdensome
to require the submission of copies of those documents. Given the fact that the regulations allow five working days
after arrival for the submission of a vessel repair entry, it should be possible to provide existing written cost estimates
to Customs by the time the entry process is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The addition of 30 days to the filing time is unnecessary and will only serve to further delay the entry liquidation
process. Further, the language of the proposal should have been written to require the submission of written estimates
with all entries which are filed as incomplete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs disagrees. The proposal was limited to requiring the submission of existing estimated cost documents. Customs
does not wish to require that each operator generate new documentation and submit it during the entry process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of all comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined that
the amendments should be adopted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is certified that the amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, they are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD's regulation at 24 CFR 24.700 is being amended to eliminate the designation of authority to order Limited Denials
of Participation (LDP) by specifically listed positions. The positions listed will not be accurate after HUD's Field
Office restructuring because the positions and functions of certain Department officials will be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In November 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance
and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy
by empowering HUD employees to serve HUD's customers more effectively. In implementing this objective, the Secretary
determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational levels full
authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program officials.
The ordering of LDP actions will assist in achieving the Secretary's objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, &sect;24.700 designates authority to order LDPs to Regional Administrators, Office Managers, the Director
of an Office of Indian Programs, or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing. This amendment will
give a broad designation of authority to unspecified Department officials, similar to the authority set forth in
HUD's debarment regulations at &sect;24.105(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 11, 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12861, which requires each Executive department and
agency to undertake to eliminate within three years of the effective date of the Order not less than 50 percent of its
civilian internal management regulations that are not required by law. Section 24.700 is a civilian internal management
regulation of the type referenced in the Executive Order. The Secretary of HUD has determined that listing specific
position titles in 24 CFR 24.700 is not required by law and can be accomplished through published delegations of authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of Delegation from the Secretary, delegating the Secretary's Authority to order LDPs to the Department's
Assistant Secretaries, with authority to redelegate, was published on April 15, 1994 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, &sect;10.1 provides that notice and public procedure
may be omitted with respect to rules governing the Department's organization or its own internal practices or procedures.
The amendment being made in this document is such a rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to internal administrative procedures
whose content does not relate to the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically
excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule eliminates unnecessary regulations. There are no anticompetitive discriminatory
aspects of the rule with regard to small entities, and there are not any unusual procedures that would need to be complied
with by small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is limited
to eliminating unnecessary or duplicative regulations.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulation for public housing development provides, in part, at 24 CFR 941.206(c), that PHA acquisition
of properties (with or without rehabilitation) that are secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage or are owned
by HUD may not be approved, except with the prior written approval of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian
Housing. This rule amends &sect;941.206(c) by removing the requirement for prior approval by the Assistant Secretary
and by adding properties owned by the Veterans Administration (VA) or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as eligible
for acquisition under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also streamlines the procedure for acquiring such properties by expanding the limited proposal procedure
for scattered-site projects to permit the PHA purchase of HUD/VA/RTC properties, any combination of such, and/or
in combination with the purchase of eligible properties on the open market. The limited proposal procedure would
be the same for any single family acquisition regardless of its ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule permits Field Offices to exercise more discretion in determining the nature and scope of required reviews.
In order to enable a Field Office to have the ability to limit its reviews and expedite processing, the PHA is required
to certify, either as part of its limited proposal or at the time the PHA identifies a property it wants to acquire and
provides the proposed sales contract, that compliance with all necessary applicable requirements will be met: e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Prevailing wages; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nondiscrimination requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Site and neighborhood standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Intergovernmental review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Accessibility requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Relocation requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Minimum Property Standards (MPS) or Housing Quality Standards (HQS); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If replacement housing under section 18 is involved, that the housing to be acquired is consistent with the replacement
housing plan approved by HUD; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Generally, properties constructed prior to 1978 should not be considered; however, if a proposed property was
built prior to 1978, that lead-based paint testing and the determination of the cost feasibility of abatement will
be done before the transfer of title to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. These PHA certifications do not
provide a basis for waiving or dispensing with the applicability of the aforementioned requirements, environmental
assessments and other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the PHA's submission, including the certifications, each Field Office is allowed to decide, on its own discretion,
whether or not to require the submission, technical review and approval of any further information. In order to expedite
processing, the Field Office's Housing Specialist will distribute simultaneously to each of HUD's technical offices
(in accordance with the recent reorganization at the Field Office level) the PHA's submission to determine as soon
as possible if any technical reviews are necessary. The Field Office is responsible for performing the reviews to
assure compliance with applicable requirements and development within the approved development cost limits, while
at the same time keeping the number of technical reviews at a minimum. Under this rule, there is a target period of 50
days from the time the PHA indicates it wants to acquire a specific property and when the Field Office approves or rejects
the request; after approval notification, the PHA has an additional 10 day target period to close on the property.
Properties involving extensive rehabilitation, lead-based paint testing and abatement, historic preservation
requirements and/or an uncompleted environmental assessment, may require extension of the target date. The payment
of Single Family Property Disposition (SFPD) customary extension fees is considered an eligible public housing
development expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule provides guidance on the factors that a Field Office is to consider in deciding whether or not to require additional
submissions for review and approval. The Field Office is to take into account the total development cost of the proposed
project, and the management and development capabilities of the PHA, including the PHA's performance rating under
the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) at 24 CFR part 901. The Field Office can, at its own discretion,
accept all PHA certifications that required compliances will be met, except the environmental assessment; by law,
only HUD can certify compliance with 24 CFR part 50. If the Field Office is satisfied with the PHA submission, including
its certifications, additional submissions and technical reviews will not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes to HUD's development review process are a part of the overall effort that the Department is undertaking
to promote decentralization. More authority is entrusted to the Field Offices to exercise discretion with respect
to the activities of PHAs that they deal with on a close and regular basis. PHAs are themselves empowered to act without
the prior approval of the Assistant Secretary and with the potential for more informal consultations with the Field
Office. The end result is anticipated to be a more streamlined and efficient property acquisition process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule further specifies that the limited proposal procedure under &sect;941.404(n) for scattered site properties
would also be followed for acquisition of HUD/VA/RTC properties. PHAs may identify such properties to consider for
acquisition as described below in the succeeding paragraph. Section 941.404(n) is amended to include these properties
within its scope, and to include the list of certifications discussed above. The unnumbered closing paragraph of
&sect;941.404(n) is revised to reflect the Department's streamlined review procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Acquisition by PHAs of HUD's single family acquired properties must routinely follow the established current procedures
used by HUD's Division of Single Family Property Disposition (SFPD). This includes the process by which all other
nonprofit organizations and government agencies purchase properties. After a PHA receives notice of property availability,
the PHA has 5 days to indicate interest and then an additional 15 days to submit a signed sales contract. Upon execution
of the contract by SFPD, the PHA will close the sale within the Field Office closing timeframe, generally 30&hyph;60
days. During this remaining period, all regulatory and statutory regulations must be met by the PHA before the transfer
of title to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD would like to expedite sales to PHAs and encourages PHAs to contact the Director of Housing Management in the HUD
field office having jurisdiction over the area in which the PHA has authority to determine the availability of HUD-owned
single family properties, and the status of HUD-held mortgages which may be in the process of being foreclosed.

Purchase of Properties Owned by the Veteran's Administration (VA) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement between the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of
Veteran Affairs, a framework will be established for a continuing working relationship between HUD and VA to coordinate
the sale of VA-acquired properties to PHAs. Upon request, the local VA field office will make available a list, by computer
or otherwise, of single family (one to four units) properties owned by VA and located within the PHA's jurisdiction.
PHAs will have a right of first option on these properties for a period of time from the date the list is furnished to the
PHA, and the PHA and VA will follow an agreed upon procedure for the property purchase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to RTC properties, RTC sells foreclosed single family properties in conjunction with its responsibilities
for resolving failed financial institutions. Under the RTC's Affordable Housing Disposition (AHD) Program, public
agencies, nonprofit organizations and low/moderate-income buyers have an exclusive right for a period of time to
purchase lower-priced single family properties that the RTC has placed on the market. RTC offers these properties
at their fair market value and publicizes the availability of these properties through various state and local housing
agencies and Federal Home Loan Banks, which serve as property information clearinghouses. PHAs are to contact the
Affordable Housing Disposition Department Head at the local RTC field offices in order to be placed on the RTC property
mailing list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that the changes made by this rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by
requiring prior notice and comment. These changes primarily constitute a change in the Department's own review procedures
and the elimination of a requirement to obtain prior approval of the Assistant Secretary before a PHA may acquire certain
properties. As such, prior notice and comment are unnecessary, and the rule is exempt under 24 CFR part 10 from notice
and comment requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under
the Order. This rule removes a layer of prior HUD review and approval and allows Field Offices to exercise more discretion
at multiple processing stages for the acquisition of certain properties. It will not have substantial, direct effects
on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationships with the Federal government, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
rule will have only an indirect, though beneficial, impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
since it should simplify the development of housing by PHAs, and thus, is not subject to review under the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Proposals for the acquisition of single family properties (with or without rehabilitation) that are secured
by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage or are owned by HUD, the Veterans Administration (VA), or the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC), must be submitted to the Field Office for approval. The limited proposal procedure for scattered-site
projects, as set forth at 24 CFR 941.404(n), may be followed to facilitate the PHA purchase for scattered-site projects
of HUD/VA/RTC properties, any combination of such, and/or in combination with the purchase of eligible properties
on the open market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After approval of the limited proposal and execution of the ACC, Field Offices will determine the nature and scope
of required technical reviews, taking into consideration the PHA submission identifying a property it wants to acquire
that includes the proposed sales contract and PHA certifications that compliance with all necessary requirements
will be met. If the PHA has provided the certifications as part of its limited proposal, the Field Office can, at its
own discretion, accept all PHA certifications that required compliances will be met except the environmental assessment;
by law, only HUD can certify compliance with 24 CFR part 50. The PHA certifications do not waive or dispense with the
applicability of other Federal requirements pursuant to 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209, but only serve to facilitate
the approval process. These certifications shall address, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prevailing wages; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Nondiscrimination requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Site and neighborhood standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Intergovernmental review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Accessibility requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Relocation requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Minimum Property Standards (MPS) or Housing Quality Standards (HQS); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) If replacement housing under section 18 is involved, that the housing to be acquired is consistent with the
Replacement Housing Plan approved by HUD; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Generally, properties constructed prior to 1978 should not be considered; however, if a proposed property was
built prior to 1978, that lead-based paint testing and the determination of the cost feasibility of abatement will
be done before the transfer to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After receiving a PHA's submission in accordance with paragraph (c) (2) of this section, each Field Office will
decide whether or not to require the review and approval of any further information, based on its consideration of
the PHA's submission, the acquisition cost of the property, and the management and development capabilities of the
PHA, including the PHA's performance rating, under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) at
24 CFR part 901. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Field Office will perform all necessary reviews to assure all compliance requirements are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Under this section, there is a target period of 50 days from the time the PHA indicates it wants to acquire a specific
property and when the Field Office approves or rejects the request; after approval notification, the PHA has an additional
10 day target period in which to close on the property. Properties involving additional requirements, such as acquisition
with extensive rehabilitation, lead-based paint testing and abatement, historic preservation requirements and/or
an uncompleted environmental assessment, may require extension of the target date.

 (1) PHAs may, in lieu of submission of the complete proposal described in this section, submit a limited proposal if:
the proposal is for the acquisition of properties secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage, or owned by HUD,
the Veterans Administration (VA), or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); or the proposal is for a project involving
scattered-site acquisition or a scattered-site conventional new construction or rehabilitation development,
and the proposal has been determined to be eligible for front-end funding pursuant to &sect;941.402(c) or &sect;941.403(c),
and the diversity of ownership of the properties is expected to make site control difficult.

(J) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HUD will review the limited proposal, in accordance with &sect;941.405, and upon approval of the proposal, HUD
will execute the ACC and permit advances for the purposes and amounts described in &sect;941.406(b)(3). The PHA will
select individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties in accordance with its approved limited proposal, but will not acquire a property or make a commitment
to acquire without specific HUD site approval, and a determination that the property, including the resulting total
development cost, is consistent with the approved limited proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 15, 1992, MSHA published a final rule revising its safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines
(57 FR 20868). These standards were to take effect on August 16, 1992. On August 6, 1992, MSHA delayed the effective
date of the rule until November 16, 1992, to allow mine operators time to effectively plan and implement necessary
changes (57 FR 34683). On November 13, 1992, as a result of discussions with the mining community, MSHA administratively
stayed the effective date of &sect;&sect;75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) until July 1, 1993 (57 FR 53856). Section 75.313
was stayed to allow MSHA to further evaluate the effect of fan stoppages in certain mines. Section 75.344(a)(1) was
stayed to evaluate whether requiring portable compressors to be located in a noncombustible structure or area could
create a fire hazard due to overheating. MSHA also recodified the provisions these standards were to replace as &sect;&sect;75.314,
75.315 and 75.345. On June 7, 1993, MSHA extended the stay until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 31908). Consistent with the stay
extension, the recodified provisions continue in effect until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 33996). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of meetings with the mining public and further review of the ventilation rule, the Agency is initiating
a rulemaking to address the issues which prompted the stay. On December 30, 1993, MSHA published a notice (58 FR 69312)
proposing to extend the stay until completion of a rulemaking involving these and other ventilation standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency received comments from interested parties concurring with the proposed extension. By this notice the
Agency is extending the stay of &sect;&sect;75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) until completion of the ventilation rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice does not affect the indefinite suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;75.321(a) (57 FR 55457). That action was in response to an order of the United States Court of Appeals which stayed
&sect;75.321(a) indefinitely, pending court review.

in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to public interest since the fireworks
display is for public viewing.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 4, 1994, the Burlington Department of Parks and Recreation submitted an application to hold a fireworks program
at Burlington Waterfront Park, Burlington, Vermont. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in all
waters of Burlington Harbor within 250 feet of a point located on the southern corner of Burlington Waterfront Park
at or near 44

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;

&rsquo; W longitude. This safety zone is needed to protect boaters from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding
in the area. No vessel will be permitted to enter or move within this safety zone unless authorized to do so by the Coast
Guard Captain of the Port, New York.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). No vessel traffic is permitted to transit within
250 feet of a point located on the southern corner of Burlington Waterfront Park in Burlington Harbor. Due to the limited
duration of the event, the extensive advisories that will be made, and the limited traffic in the area at this time,
and the fact that vessel traffic can safely transit around this zone, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of
this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a Regulated Navigation Area at the Oliver Lock and Dam at MM 338 of the Black Warrior
River. This regulation places restrictions on downbound tows passing through the lock during periods of high Tail-Water
Gauge readings. Strong currents exist during high water conditions below the lock and dam that set downbound tows
against the right protruding bank. The regulations applicable in this regulated navigation area in high water conditions
will alleviate this problem.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation, and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures
would have been contrary to the public interest. Several near miss marine casualties have occurred previously as
a result of the conditions cited above. Immediate action is needed to prevent marine casualties and to protect the
environment during instances of high water.

Discussion of Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations have been established to decrease the risk of a marine casualty or oil pollution incident below
the Oliver Lock and Dam. During normal river conditions, a tow leaving the lock has the current coming over the dam moving
the tow to the right, making it difficult to move away from the lock wall and the right bank. The tows must navigate around
a point of land on the right descending bank, which is fortified with rip-rap. In order to avoid this bank, they must
offset the current by powering toward the Hunt Oil Dock located on the left descending bank in the same area. This situation
is hazardous as a tow may be pushed into the right descending bank or ram crude oil barges docked at Hunt Oil, causing
a major marine casualty or pollution incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recent incomplete removal of the deflector dike on the downstream side of the Oliver Lock and Dam has accentuated
the problem of currents pushing downbound tows toward the right protruding bank as they exit the lock. However, the
problem will continue after removal of the remainder of the deflector dike. In higher water conditions, the currents
are stronger and therefore the situation is even more hazardous. Already these conditions have resulted in many near
misses, as reported by many of the towing companies using the lock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard seeks to alleviate this situation by limiting tow sizes as the water level increases. This makes maneuvering
easier for towboat operators because smaller tows have less area for the current to affect and because smaller tows
increase the horsepower per ton ratio for the tow. Prohibiting downbound oil or hazardous material barges from transitting
the lock when the river is exceptionally high will alleviate the danger of those products being released due to the
hazardous downbound conditions should a tow and barge have difficulty navigating due to these hazardous downbound
conditions.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not considered to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant
under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic
impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. This is based on the following
historic data provided by the Army Corps of Engineers for percentage of days per year on which conditions exist on the
Black Warrior River that would require compliance with this regulation: a Tail-Water Gauge reading of 102.3 feet
or less_78% or 285 days per year; a Tail-Water Gauge reading of 102.3 feet to 112.3 feet_16% or 58 days per year; a Tail-Water
Gauge reading of 112.3 feet or greater_6% or 22 days per year. Normal high water periods are during the months of January
through April. Transit statistics for the Black Warrior and Tombigbee Rivers for the most recent year for which such
statistics are available, 1989, indicate that there were 8,110 towboat transits, including 1,517 tank barge transits,
which may be potentially affected by these regulations. Additionally, the Coast Guard certifies that this regulation
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is making the deep draft channel between Narragansett Bay Entrance Lighted Horn Buoy NB (LLNR 17675)
and Providence River Channel Light 42 (LLNR 18580, Fuller Rock Light), a Regulated Navigation Area (RNA). This action
is necessary to protect the maritime community from the hazards to navigation associated with the extreme shoaling
that has taken place within the Providence River channel.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 17, 1993, the Captain of the Port, Providence, signed an emergency Safety Zone Regulation for the Providence
River Channel. This regulation was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14151). The Captain of the Port, Providence requested comments concerning the safety zone
regulation and received none. This emergency Safety Zone Regulation imposed restrictions on vessel traffic pertaining
to maximum allowable drafts, one way traffic, and communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing the establishment of a Regulated Navigation
Area in the Providence River in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65684). That NPRM differed from the emergency safety zone regulations by enlarging the
area which is regulated, adding a restriction concerning operations in reduced visibility, and reducing the number
of SECURITE call locations for outbound vessels. No letters or comments on the proposed rule were received. Therefore,
the Coast Guard is publishing the final regulation as proposed. Public hearings were not requested and none were held.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February of 1993, the Captain of the Port, Providence, received the results of a hydrographic survey of the Providence
River Federal navigation channel. This survey conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers showed that serious shoaling
was taking place in the northern section of the channel. To provide for the safety of the port, the Captain of the Port,
Providence, published an emergency Safety Zone regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14151). Comments were solicited and none were received. A task force to study the need for dredging
in the affected areas was organized by the state. However, due to the contamination of the dredge spoils and local environmental
concerns, a decision is not expected in the near future. The finalizing of this RNA will allow the Coast Guard to regulate
vessel traffic over an extended period of time. It is designed to protect the Port of Providence from any deep draft
vessel casualty due to shoaling that may result in a grounding or associated casualty leading to loss of life, injury,
property loss, oil or hazardous material discharge, or blockage of the channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing safety zone regulating vessel traffic in the effected area will expire on May 1, 1994. In the interest
of safety and the public's interest in maintaining continuity in the regulations governing vessel traffic in this
area, good cause exists for having this rule, which is nearly identical to the regulations that have been in effect
since February 17, 1993, take effect on May 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The emergency regulations
have been in effect since February 17, 1993. Commercial operators utilizing the Port of Providence have reported
no problems or economic burdens due to these regulations. The volume of commercial traffic utilizing this waterway
is such that the costs incurred due to delays because of one-way traffic or reduced visibility are considered minimal
and are far outweighed by the extra measures of safety provided by the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the
economic impact of this rule to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is approving a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. This revision
establishes and requires that the degree of emission limitation required for the control of any air pollutant is not
affected by that portion of the stack height which exceeds good engineering practice (GEP) or by any other dispersion
technique. The revision is consistent with the stack height provisions under EPA's ``Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans_Control Strategy''. The intended effect of this action is to approve
a SIP revision consisting of a stack height regulation adopted by the State of West Virginia. The State adopted this
regulation to conform to the July 8, 1985 Federal promulgation of a revised stack height regulation. This action is
being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 2, 1990, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor, and Environmental Resources submitted a revision
to its State implementation plan (SIP) to incorporate a regulation for good engineering practice (GEP) as it applies
to stack heights. The revision consists of West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission (WVAPCC) Regulation 20_``Good
Engineering Practice as Applies to Stack Heights'' (45CSR20), adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on April
8, 1989 and effective July 14, 1989. The SIP revision is consistent with EPA's revised stack height regulation as published
in the July 8, 1985 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 8, 1985, EPA promulgated a revised stack height regulation to ensure that the degree of emission limitation
required for the control of any pollutant under an applicable SIP is not affected by that portion of any stack height
which exceeds GEP or by any other dispersion technique (See 50 FR 27892). The regulation updated the rule promulgated
on February 8, 1982 at 47 FR 5864.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 2, 1990, the State of West Virginia responded to the July 8, 1985

EPA Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated West Virginia's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The stack height requirements
will not adversely affect West Virginia's ability to enforce the current applicable emission limitations which
adequately protect the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS); (2) the stack height requirements are clearly
enforceable; and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided
in a Technical Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to West Virginia's regulations have been effective in the State
since July 14, 1989. This action will be effective June 20, 1994 unless, by May 19, 1994, notice is received that adverse
or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective
date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another
will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments
are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 20, 1994.

Final Action

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the WVAPCC Regulation 20_``Good Engineering Practice as Applies to Stack Heights'' (45CSR20) submitted
by the State of West Virginia as a revision to the West Virginia SIP. EPA's review of West Virginia's stack height regulation
indicates that it conforms to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 51 and 52, and to the July 8, 1985 Federal promulgation
of a revised stack height regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action
conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 20, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

 43 CFR Part 230 pertains to the management of water rights for individuals receiving benefits from Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) irrigation projects. This regulation is outdated because current procedures for managing water
rights conform to State requirements rather than procedures stated in this regulation. This regulation is no longer
applicable to Reclamation programs, and so it is being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
43 CFR Part 406 was written in the 1950's to help carry out the Farm Unit Exchange Act (Act of August 13, 1953, 67 Stat.
556) that provides for the exchange of certain unpatented farm units or private land on a Federal irrigation project,
for certain classes of qualified applicants whose lands have been determined, pursuant to a land classification,
to be insufficient to support a family, and the amendment of farm units by the addition of contiguous or noncontiguous
land on the same project. All farm units that were eligible for exchange have been exchanged, and since the program
is no longer active, this regulation is no longer applicable to Reclamation programs, and so it is being removed from
the Code of Federal Regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding adopts rules to implement sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (the
Act), as amended by section 6000(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). The new rules adopted:
interpret the elements that define the terms ``commercial mobile radio service (CMRS)'' and ``private mobile radio
service (PMRS);'' based on these definitions, determine the regulatory status of existing mobile services and of
personal communications services (PCS); address the degree to which those services that will be classified as CMRS
will be subject to regulation under Title II of the Act; and address the other issues, including interconnection rights
and preemption of state regulatory authority over mobile service providers. The Commission's action furthers the
congressional objectives of ensuring that similar services are subject to consistent regulatory classification
and that appropriate levels of regulation be established for CMRS providers. The Commission's action establishes
a symmetrical regulatory structure that will promote competition in the mobile services marketplace and will serve
the interests of consumers while also benefiting the national economy.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 604, a final regulatory flexibility analysis
has been prepared and is presented below. It is available for public viewing as part of the full text of this decision,
which may be obtained from the Commission or its copy contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 603 of title 5, United States Code, 5 U.S.C. 603, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was
incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252. Written comments on the proposals
in the Notice, including the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, were requested.

A. Need for and Purpose of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act. The rules
adopted herein will carry out the intent of Congress to establish a uniform regulatory framework for all mobile services.

B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While all the parties recognize that this rulemaking will impose new legal obligations on licensees whose regulatory
status has changed from private to commercial as a result of the new legislation and the actions we have taken in this
Order, a number of parties propose that licensees should be able to offer both commercial and private radio service
on the same system and under a single license. As a result of these comments, we have adopted these proposals. As a result
of other comments, we have made modifications to other proposals as appropriate.

C. Significant Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have reduced the burdens wherever possible. In an effort to reduce the burdens on small entities, for example, we
will not impose any tariff filing obligations. In addition, we emphasize that the three-year transition rules adopted
in this Order will allow existing licensees that are subject to reclassification as CMRS providers to continue to
be regulated as private until August 10, 1996. This three-year period will ensure an orderly transition for all reclassified
private licensees that are small entities.

Synopsis of the Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 23, 1993, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice), 58 FR 53169 (October 14, 1993),
in this proceeding in which we sought comment on: (1) The definitional issues raised in the Budget Act; (2) which existing
mobile services and future mobile services should be classified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' under the
statute and which should be classified as ``private mobile radio services''; and (3) which provisions of Title II
of the Communications Act should not be applied to CMRS. We received 76 comments and 52 reply comments in response to
the Notice in this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summarizing the actions the Commission has taken in this Order, the following points highlight the decisions made
to implement the objectives of Congress in amending section 332 of the Act. First, the Order gives a comprehensive
scope to the term ``mobile service,'' including within the definition all public mobile services, private land mobile
service, mobile satellite services, and most marine and aviation wireless services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Order defined the term ``commercial mobile radio service'' in a manner that covers a significant portion
of services provided by mobile carriers because of the conclusion that such a definition best serves the congressional
purpose of making mobile services widely available at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms in a competitive marketplace.
There are three prongs to the CMRS definition: The service must be provided for profit, it must be interconnected to
the public switched network, and it must be available to the public or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively
available to a substantial portion of the public. Under the first element of the definition, the Order provides that
``for profit'' includes any mobile service that is provided with the intent of receiving compensation or monetary
gain. In the case of services that are not-for-profit, except for a portion of excess capacity that the licensee offers
with the intent of receiving compensation, the service will be treated as for-profit to the extent of such excess capacity
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second element of the CMRS definition, the Order concludes that a mobile service offers interconnected
service if it allows subscribers to send or receive messages to or from anywhere on the public switched network (PSN).
Both direct and indirect interconnection with the PSN satisfy this criterion, as well as the use of store-and-forward
technology. The Order also gives an expansive meaning to the term public switch network, concluding that the network
includes the facilities of common carriers that participate in the North American Numbering Plan and having switching
capability.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the third prong of the definition, the Order decides that service made available ``to the public'' means any
service that is offered without restriction on who may receive it. The Order also concludes that whether a service
is offered to ``such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public''
depends on several relevant factors, such as the type, nature, and scope of users for whom the service is intended.
The Commission decided not to consider limited system capacity or coverage of small geographic areas as factors in
restricting system availability. If a service is provided only for internal use or only to a specified class of eligible
users under the Commission's rules, then the Order concludes that the service will not meet the ``public availability''
prong of the CMRS definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Order interpreted the term ``private mobile radio service'' by closely adhering to the statutory definition,
and with the aim of advancing the congressional objective of applying a symmetrical regulatory framework to mobile
services. The Order determines that the statutory language and the legislative history support the conclusion that
a mobile service may be classified as PMRS only if it does not fall within the statutory definition of CMRS and is not
the functional equivalent of a service that meets the three-part definition of CMRS. Those services that are classified
as PMRS will, however, be presumed PMRS unless it is demonstrated that the service is the functional equivalent of
CMRS. In applying the functional equivalence test, the Order considers a variety of factors, including whether the
mobile service involved is a close substitute for any CMRS offering as evidenced by the cross-price elasticity of
demand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, applying the definitions discussed above, the Order classifies existing private land mobile services and
common carrier services. For example, all existing Government and Public Safety Services (including the Special
Emergency Radio Service) and all Industrial and Land Transportation Services other than certain Business Radio
Service are classified as PMRS. The Order also classifies Automatic Vehicle Monitoring as a private mobile radio
service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Business Radio Service, which has a broader range of eligible users than other Industrial and Land Transportation
services, the Order classifies Business Radio licensees who provide for-profit interconnected service to third-party
users as CMRS. Business Radio licensees who operate not-for-profit internal systems, or who do not offer interconnected
service, are classified as private.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order classifies Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) licensees as CMRS if they offer interconnected service to customers.
In addition, private carrier paging (PCP) services are classified as CMRS because they fit the statutory definition
of CMRS. The Order concludes, however, those PCP systems that service the licensee's internal communications needs
and do not offer for-profit service to third-party customers will be classified as PMRS. The Order classifies 220&hyph;222
MHz private land mobile systems using the same approach taken by the Order for classifying SMR and PCP licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with respect to existing common carrier services, the Order classifies as CMRS: Cellular service, 800 MHz
air-ground service, common carrier paging service, mobile telephone service, improved mobile telephone service,
trunked mobile telephone service, 454 MHz air-ground service, and Offshore Radio Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to mobile satellite service, the Order concludes that the Commission will exercise its discretion under
the statute to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite licensees may be treated as
common carriage. Lastly, the Order concludes that the Commission will seek further comment in a subsequent proceeding
on whether it should remove existing restrictions that bar CMRS providers from offering dispatch service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, the Order determines that personal communications services (PCS) should be classified presumptively as
CMRS. Under this approach, a PCS applicant or licensee would be regulated as a CMRS carrier, but would be able to offer
private PCS and be regulated as PMRS, upon making the requisite showing. The Order concludes that treating PCS as presumptively
CMRS most suits the manner in which the Commission has defined PCS, and the four goals that the Commission established
for the service_speed of deployment, universality, competitive delivery, and diversity of services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sixth, the Order states that the Commission has decided to exercise its forbearance authority regarding several
Title II provisions in order to maximize market competition. The Order finds that the Commission's forbearance actions
will promote competition, and that application of the three-pronged test set forth in section 332(c) of the Act warrants
forbearance from many Title II provisions. In general, the Commission has forborne from enforcing any tariffing
requirements, and from exercising Commission authority to investigate into existing and newly filed rates and practices,
to collect intercarrier contracts, to require certification concerning interlocking directorates, and to require
Commission approval relating to market entry and exit (respectively, sections 203, 204, 205, 211, 212, and 214 of
the Act). The Commission, however, did not forbear from provisions that are unrelated to Commission authority and
regulatory obligations (section 210), are primarily reservations of Commission authority (sections 213, 215,
218, 219, and 221), or are consumer protection-related (sections 223, 225, 226, 227, and 228). In addition, in the
case of cellular service, the Order states that the Commission will shortly issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making
to establish monitoring provisions applicable to the cellular marketplace. The Order further provides that the
Commission will issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making addressing whether the Commission should adopt further forbearance
actions under Title II of the Act in the case of specified classes of CMRS providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventh, the Order requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to provide reasonable and fair interconnection for all
CMRS because the Commission sees no distinction between cellular carriers to whom LECs are currently required to
provide such interconnection and all other CMRS providers, including PCS providers. The Order also provides that
if a LEC provides interconnection to CMRS providers while denying the same interconnection to PMRS providers, the
carrier would bear the burden of demonstrating why such practice does not constitute a violation of Title II of the
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighth, the Order concludes that Congress, in revising section 332, intended to preempt state and local rate and entry
regulation of all CMRS. The Order establishes a range of procedural and other requirements states must meet if they
seek to retain any existing CMRS rate regulation or initiate such rate regulation for the first time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Order implements provisions of the Budget Act that establish effective dates for the ``regulatory treatment''
amendment to the Communications Act and set forth deadlines for an orderly transition to the changed regulatory structure.
The Budget Act established a three-year transition period during which ``any private land mobile service provided
by any person before such date of enactment, and any paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January
1, 1993, for private land mobile service shall *&blank;*&blank;* be treated as private mobile service.'' With respect
to private land mobile services, the Order interprets this language to mean that the three-year transition applies
to all private land mobile licensees who were licensed, and therefore authorized to provide service, as of August
10, 1993. On the other hand, the Order provides that private mobile licensees who are subject to reclassification
as CMRS and were not licensed as of the enactment date of the Budget Act, are not subject to the three-year ``grandfathering''
period, and will therefore be treated as CMRS as soon as the Commission's rules go into effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concluded that Congress did not intend the transition period to apply in a rigid fashion to pre-enactment
licensees and that it did intend some flexibility in the implementation of these transition provisions. The Commission
determined, therefore, that it will allow grandfathered licensees to modify and expand existing systems and to acquire
additional licenses in the same service for which they were licensed prior to August 10, 1993. In addition, with respect
to non-grandfathered licensees, the Commission concluded that reclassification should be effective upon the effective
date of the Commission's transitional rules for reclassified services; these rules will be considered in a separate
rule making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to paging services, the Order finds that the transition period applies more broadly. The Commission
concluded that Congress specifically provided that all paging licensees ``utilizing'' private paging frequencies
allocated as of January 1, 1993, are to be treated as private mobile radio service providers for three years. The Commission
noted that the Conference Report accompanying the Budget Act explains that paging was treated separately to prevent
states from attempting to restrict entry of paging licensees on private frequencies prior to the effective date of
the Commission's preemption regulations, which do not go into effect until August 10, 1994. The Commission concluded
that all private paging licensees are to be treated as private mobile service providers, regardless of whether they
were licensed before or after the date of enactment.

mobile radio service by filing a petition for declaratory ruling challenging a mobile service provider's regulatory
treatment as a private mobile radio service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The petition must show that: (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The mobile service in question meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a service that meets the definition of a commercial
mobile radio service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination whether the mobile service in question is the functional
equivalent of a commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the service to determine whether
the service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the service
under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio service would prompt customers to change from one
service to the other; and market research information identifying the targeted market for the service under review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The petition must contain specific allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal
knowledge. The petition must be served on the mobile service provider against whom it is filed and contain a certificate
of service to this effect. The mobile service provider may file an opposition to the petition and the petitioner may
file a reply. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in &sect;&sect;1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter
shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Licensees of a Personal Communications Service or applicants for a Personal Communications Service license
proposing to use any Personal Communications Service spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio service
basis must overcome the presumption that Personal Communications Service is a commercial mobile radio service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The applicant or licensee (who must file an application to modify its authorization) seeking authority to dedicate
a portion of the spectrum for private mobile radio service, must include a certification that it will offer Personal
Communications Service on a private mobile radio service basis. The certification must include a description of
the proposed service sufficient to demonstrate that it is not within the definition of commercial mobile radio service
in &sect;20.3. Any application requesting to use any Personal Communications Service spectrum to offer service
on a private mobile radio service basis will be placed on public notice by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any interested party may file a petition to deny the application within 30 days after the date of public notice announcing
the acceptance for filing of the application. The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact supported
by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge to show that the applicant's request does not rebut the commercial
mobile radio service presumption. The petition must be served on the applicant and contain a certificate of service
to this effect. The applicant may file an opposition with allegations of fact supported by affidavit. The petitioner
may file a reply. No additional pleadings will be allowed. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in
&sect;1.1 through &sect;1.52 of this chapter and &sect;22.30 of this chapter shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any provider of private land mobile service before August 10, 1993 (including any system expansions, modifications,
or acquisitions of additional licenses in the same service, even if authorized after this date), and any private paging
service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January 1, 1993, that meet the definition of commercial mobile radio
service, shall, except for purposes of &sect;20.5 (applicable August 10, 1993 for the providers listed in this paragraph),
be treated as private mobile radio service until August 10, 1996. After this date, these entities will be treated as
commercial mobile radio service providers regulated under this part.

(1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for commercial mobile radio services do not adequately
protect subscribers to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably
discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market conditions
for commercial mobile radio services do not protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates,
or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial portion of the commercial mobile
radio service subscribers in the state or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining basic
telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range of basic telephone service alternatives available
to consumers in the state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of evidence, information, and analysis that may
be considered pertinent to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission in reviewing any
petition filed by a state under this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the state, the types of services offered by commercial
mobile radio service providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have offered service in the
state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service provider in the state; trends in each provider's
customer base during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data
is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of return for each commercial mobile radio service provider;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service provider, including trends in each provider's rates
during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data is unavailable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the commercial mobile radio service providers the state
proposes to regulate are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of competing services, and an analysis of any barriers
to such entry;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive
or discriminatory practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in the state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with particularity instances of systematic unjust and
unreasonable rates, or rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon commercial mobile radio
service subscribers. Such evidence should include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. Additionally,
evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace
in the state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be considered especially probative; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile
radio service providers, including statistics and other information about complaints filed with the state regulatory
commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency filing the petition is the duly authorized state
agency responsible for the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file comments in support or in opposition to the petition
within 30 days after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this section. Any interested party may
file a reply within 15 days after the expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings may be filed.
Except for &sect;1.45 of this chapter, practice and procedure rules contained in &sect;&sect;1.42&hyph;1.52 of
this chapter shall apply. The provisions of &sect;&sect;1.771&hyph;1.773 of this chapter do not apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio
services in the state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the Commission. The period of time specified
by the Commission will be that necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly or unreasonably
discriminatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under

reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS adopts as final, with one change, the interim final rule authorizing the Southwest Regional Director (RD), NMFS,
to require the owner or agent of a vessel with a permit for the longline fishery to make accommodations for a NMFS observer.
This final rule requires permit holders or their designated agents (which may include the vessel operator) to provide
NMFS with at least 72 hours notice (not including weekends and Federal holidays) prior to each departure from port
so the RD can determine if an observer placement will be made. This action is necessary to ensure adequate collection-of-data
on the frequency and nature of interactions between longline fishing gear and sea turtles around Hawaii to ensure
the fishery operates in compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pelagic fisheries of the western Pacific region, including the longline fishery based in Hawaii, are managed
under a Fishery Management Plan (FMP) that was approved in 1987 and subsequently was amended six times. Rules implementing
the FMP are found at 50 CFR part 685. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement were issued June 10, 1993, concerning the take of sea turtles in
the Hawaii longline fishery. In addition to setting a limit on the incidental take of sea turtles, the Incidental Take
Statement also requires NMFS to establish an observer program (initially through voluntary placements and subsequently
through a mandatory program) to ensure collection of sufficient data to produce statistically significant results
and to evaluate the accuracy of logbooks submitted for the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule provides the administrative mechanism for NMFS to carry out the observer program with general longline
permit holders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim final rule establishing the mandatory observer program was published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67699).
In that rule, the observer placement authority was provided under the limited entry permit requirement for longline
vessels under an existing longline limited entry program in Hawaii. It was anticipated that a new limited entry program
would be implemented by an FMP amendment existing at the time the program expires at midnight, April 22, 1994. However,
the proposed FMP amendment (Amendment 7) was not submitted to the Secretary for review and implementation under the
Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) until late January 1994. Under the normal schedule
of the Magnuson Act for action on FMP amendments, the new program (if approved) will not be implemented before mid-June
1994. This means there could be a lapse of 2 months in observer placements due to the lack of a limited entry program and
moratorium permits to which the existing observer requirements apply. If this occurred, there would be a substantial
risk that the incidental take of turtles could erroneously be estimated. This could result in adverse impacts on sea
turtles, if the take of turtles were significantly underestimated and corrective action to protect turtles were
not taken; or adverse impacts on the industry if the take of turtles were overestimated and unnecessary constraints
were imposed on the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule is being adopted as final with one change. The change from the interim final rule is to impose
the observer placement requirements on the owner of a vessel covered by a general longline permit issued under &sect;685.9,
provided any part of the vessel's next fishing trip will occur in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Hawaii.
This is a change from the interim rule, which required notification of NMFS by holders of permits issued pursuant to
the current moratorium under &sect;685.15. However, the moratorium, and the permits issued thereunder, are due
to expire April 22, 1994. As explained above, a replacement limited entry program will probably not be implemented
prior to April 22, 1994. Therefore, in order to continue to collect observer data, NMFS needs to modify the observer
requirement to apply to vessels with general longline permits issued under &sect;685.9. These general permits are
currently required and will remain so even with the expiration of the moratorium and implementation of a new limited
entry program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the interim final rule were received from two persons. One commenter emphasized the importance of obtaining
detailed, at-sea data on the longline fishery and fully endorsed the observer program. The other commenter raised
a number of operational concerns tied to the timing of notices prior to fishing trips and of observer placement meetings.
This commenter suggested that more flexibility is needed to accommodate the nature of the fishery and the difficulty
for fishermen to make firm timing commitments regarding vessel departures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No changes have been made in the regulations as a result of these comments. Experience in observer programs in other
fisheries indicates that arrangements usually can be made for modifications when necessary to accommodate changes
in schedules (&sect;685.11(c) (1) and (3)) and delays in departure times or special accommodations for observers
(&sect;685.11(d)). It is recognized that vessel operators may want to make rapid turnaround on trips and may not have
72 hours on shore to contact NMFS concerning the next trip. These operators can contact NMFS through a telephone call
from their vessels at sea, if necessary, to determine if an observer will be required and to arrange the placement,
if necessary. If a vessel's departure is delayed, the operator can telephone NMFS on a toll free line to arrange for
a change in schedule with little disruption. NMFS expects that experience in the longline fishery observer program
will provide feedback from vessel owners and operators that should result in an effective program with minimal disruption
of vessel operations and scheduling. If necessary, changes can be made to operational procedures without requiring
changes in the regulations. Finally, one of the two commenters pointed out correctly that the preamble to the proposed
rule could be clarified to indicate that: (a) The Council had recommended, and the Secretary had taken, emergency
action to close the protected species zone to longline fishing before the Biological Opinion was issued; and (b) the
limited success of the voluntary observer program had been due in large part to the limited number of observers available
for duty.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries NOAA, (AA), has determined that the measures in this rule are consistent
with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of E.O. 12866, this rule has been determined to be ``not significant''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. Permit holders
or their designated agents will have to notify NMFS at least 72 hours prior to departure on a fishing trip so the RD can
determine whether an observer must be taken. If the RD concludes an observer must be taken, the permit holder or designated
agent will be so advised and further arrangements will be made, as necessary, concerning details of time and place
of embarkation, observer duties, permit holder, vessel operator and crew responsibilities, and related matters.
Vessel owners may submit reimbursement claims for certain observer-related costs. The public reporting burden
for this collection is estimated to average 5 minutes per call, with all trips covered. About 10 percent of all calls
would result in an observer placement, requiring possibly 1 hour to meet with NMFS officials and make observer placement
arrangements. This collection is part of a previously approved collection (Southwest Region Logbook Family of Forms,
OMB No. 0648&hyph;0214), modification of which was approved by the Office of Management and Budget for the interim
final rule. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or on any other aspect of this collection-of-information
to the RD (see

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is intended to carry out the requirements of the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued
by NMFS under section 7 of the ESA on June 10, 1993. These data are necessary to determine the impacts of take on the species
and possible measures to reduce or prevent the take in the future. Therefore, this rule is consistent with the ESA.

SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the EPA Acquisition Regulation (EPAAR) coverage on organizational conflicts of interest
for all EPA contracts. In addition, it adds EPAAR coverage on conflicts of interest related to contractor personnel
working under EPA Superfund contracts and conflicts of interest related to contractors' future work which may jeopardize
Superfund work. Under this rule, contracts funded through EPA's Superfund program will contain clauses: requiring
contractor employees working on EPA Superfund contracts to sign confidentiality agreements; requiring a contractor
to notify the Agency immediately of any conflicts of interest regarding contractor personnel working on the EPA contract;
and restricting a contractor's future contracts, outside of those with EPA, when such contracts may conflict with
the work performed for EPA. These changes are necessary to avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest in work
performed under EPA Superfund contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 9.501 defines an organizational conflict of interest as existing
when ``because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable
to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract
work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.'' Under EPA's Superfund program,
contractors are often asked to assist the Agency in designing remedial actions to clean up hazardous waste sites,
in identifying potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at hazardous waste sites and in implementing actions to effect
the cleanup. After identification of PRPs for specific sites, the Agency will attempt to secure private party conducted
response action or to expend Superfund Trust Funds to conduct response action and to recover costs expended for cleanup
either through consent agreements or litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Superfund program it is essential that contractors not enter into outside contracts or use personnel which
might result in an actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition, since litigation may continue for several
years after a contractor has completed work and the contractor may be asked to testify on the work performed for EPA,
it is essential that actual or potential conflicts of interest be avoided even after the contract work has been completed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to organizational conflicts of interest, EPA must ensure that contractor personnel assigned to work
on EPA contracts are free from personal conflicts of interest that might impair their ability to perform the required
work in an impartial manner. EPAAR clauses have been developed which will require EPA's Superfund contractors to
ensure that actual or potential personal conflicts of interest regarding contractor personnel are identified and
reported to the EPA Contracting Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These clauses shall be incorporated into new solicitations and new contracts. Clauses for contracts existing as
of the effective date of this rule shall be negotiated by the EPA Contracting Officer, on a case-by-case basis, and
shall be substantially similar to the clauses required by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has developed a Long Term Contracting Strategy to more effectively manage the Superfund program over the
next ten years. The clauses in this rule reflect the changing nature of the Superfund program. Although we intend to
implement the Strategy with minimal program disruption, there may be some changes to the form of some existing Superfund
contracts. Therefore, we anticipate the clauses in this rule may require updating to reflect ongoing changes to the
Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was published as a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 26, 1990, at 55 FR 17724. Twenty-two public comments were received. We express our appreciation to all the
interested organizations for the time they took in studying the proposed rule and preparing comments. As a result
of these comments, we have made a number of revisions to the rule. In seriously considering all of the comments, we implemented
recommendations that would improve the quality of the rule and minimize the burden to the contractor community, yet
ensure that EPA's programs are adequately protected. Part B of the preamble summarizes the general issues raised
and provides EPA's response and Part C of the preamble addresses section-specific comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the numbering in EPAAR subpart 1509.5 is being amended to conform with numbering changes to FAR subpart
9.5. These changes are made solely to conform to the FAR numbering scheme and do not otherwise affect the existing EPAAR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters expressed support for an EPA rule on conflict of interest although some recommended that EPA withdraw
the proposed rule. We welcome public support and are committed to implementing a conflict of interest rule that protects
the integrity of the Superfund and other EPA programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters expressed concern that the January 1990, memorandum from the Director of the EPA's Procurement and
Contracts Management Division, which conveyed general guidance on conflict of interest to Superfund contract staff
and Superfund contractors, was not published with the proposed rule and formally open for public comments. Some also
expressed concern with issues it raised and requested that it be rescinded. Others mentioned that they were pleased
that the proposed rule was a considerable improvement over the January 1990, guidance. It was EPA's intent that the
proposed rule supersede the January 1990, guidance. We would like to make it clear that this final rule and its preamble
discussion supersedes the January 1990, guidance and the proposed rule.

Some commenters questioned EPA's authority to implement a conflict of interest rule and questioned the need for an
EPA rule on conflicts of interest stating that adequate safeguards exist. Others contended that there is no balance
between the benefits to be achieved compared to the cost of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. FAR subpart 1.3 provides agencies with the authority to implement supplemental acquisition regulations
to satisfy specific needs of the agency. We have developed the conflict of interest rule to address the specific requirements
of EPA's Superfund and other programs since sufficient coverage is not provided by existing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past few years, the General Accounting Office (GAO) in conducting reviews of EPA's programs, the EPA in performing
management studies of the Superfund program, and Congressional Committees have all concluded that EPA's existing
conflict of interest procedures are inadequate to protect its programs. The GAO in its report ``Superfund Contracts:
EPA's Procedures for Preventing Conflicts of Interest Need Strengthening'' (GAO/RCED&hyph;899&hyph;57), dated
February 1989, and EPA, in the Administrator's Management Review of the Superfund Program (1989), pointed out the
special vulnerability of the Superfund program and strongly recommended that action be taken to strengthen EPA's
existing procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is responsible for leading the nation's efforts to protect and clean up the environment. This includes the development
of environmental standards, control of toxic substances and the cleanup of hazardous wastes, as well as enforcement
of applicable laws and regulations. Historically, the Agency has relied heavily upon contractors to accomplish
its mission, and much of this work is highly sensitive, particularly in the Superfund program. The Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund) 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675,
consists of Public Law 96&hyph;510 (Dec. 11, 1980) and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. It provides
for liability, compensation, cleanup and emergency response for hazardous substances released into the environment
and the cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites. Because EPA has the dual responsibility of cleanup and enforcement
and because its contractors are often involved in both activities, and may conduct work for EPA and the private sector,
it is imperative that EPA contractors are free of conflicts so as not to jeopardize CERCLA response and enforcement/cost
recovery actions (hereinafter referred to as enforcement). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule focuses primarily on performance after contract award, unlike FAR which focuses on conflict of interest
issues related to contractor eligibility for award. Under Superfund contracts, work is performed at multiple sites
and new and constantly changing cleanup priorities make it impossible for EPA to identify, prior to contract award,
all site locations where work will be performed. In addition, it is impossible for EPA to predict, prior to contract
award, enforcement actions against PRPs at specific sites. Moreover, such cases may take years to resolve. Therefore,
EPA must address conflicts of interest during and after contract performance to effectively monitor conflicts and
safeguard Superfund enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Department of Justice and EPA attorneys, enforcing CERCLA, stress the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest
in the Superfund program. Conflicts of interest discovered after work has begun can create costly delays in cleanup
of sites when EPA must mitigate damage resulting from conflicts to safeguard cleanup work and enforcement from further
prejudice. Therefore, it is imperative that EPA contractors do not perform work for PRPs that conflicts with work
performed for the Agency. Conflicts arise because of differing interests of the EPA and PRPs. EPA's primary concern
is to assure that adequate environmental protection is provided, as opposed to the primary interests of PRPs, who
are usually motivated to keep costs minimized. Because these conflicts often arise in the context of adversarial
enforcement proceedings, such conflicts and leaks of sensitive enforcement information not only jeopardize cases
at the litigation stage, but also weaken the Government's position both in obtaining PRP commitment to clean up sites
and in cost recovery negotiations with PRPs. To date, EPA has the potential to seek over $4.5 billion in cost recovery;
the stakes are high.

EPA must preserve the integrity of the Superfund Program from conflicts of interest and cannot afford to jeopardize
the success of cost recovery actions and impede PRP cleanup of hazardous waste sites. A contractor's conflict of interest
can harm our Superfund litigation (either cost recovery litigation under section 107 of CERCLA, or litigation for
injunctive relief under section 106) in several ways: (1) By creating a conduit for confidential government information,
including potential litigation and negotiation strategies, which may be leaked to the parties with opposing interests
in the litigation, (2) by subjecting the credibility of EPA witnesses and/or the work they perform on behalf of EPA
to attack, and (3) by causing the work performed by that contractor to be redone, raising potential issues in cost recovery
litigation as to whether the cost of the extra work is recoverable. This rule requires EPA contractors to disclose
all conflicts of interest so that EPA will have the opportunity to consider the significance of the conflict and to
take appropriate measures to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has indeed faced several actual conflict situations which demonstrate the need for the Agency to strengthen its
conflict of interest procedures in order to protect the public interest: One such conflict involved a contractor
which had performed a removal action for EPA on a hazardous waste-contaminated site and which was currently doing
research work for EPA pertaining to that site. Another office of the contractor's company agreed to serve as an expert
witness in the EPA cost recovery litigation on behalf of one of the PRPs and, thus, against EPA, without knowledge or
approval of the Agency. The contractor's work in performing the removal action and research for EPA in anticipation
of cost recovery litigation conflicted directly with the contractor's serving as an expert witness on behalf of one
of the PRPs. Further, the contractor proceeded to convey confidential information to the PRP in the context of trying
to explain to the PRP why there was no conflict. Although settlement negotiations proceeded in this case, the strength
of the Agency's position was significantly weakened because the contractor was working for both parties and confidential
sensitive information had been divulged to the PRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the issues in Superfund litigation ultimately are matters of expert technical opinion for which EPA relies
on contractor personnel, e.g., support of remedy selection and findings that sites present ``imminent and substantial
endangerment'' to the public. In that role, contractors may be privy to the government's litigation and negotiation
strategies and other privileged and confidential information. The above case has taught us that contractor ``side
switching'' carries a strong potential for the passing of confidential information to defendants, even if unintentionally.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In another actual case, a contractor was performing remedial investigation/feasibility study work for both the
EPA and a major PRP on a contiguous site. Well over a quarter of a million dollars had been expended by EPA prior to the
discovery of the conflict. Work subsequently had to be stopped and all work which had been completed by the contractor
had to be either redone and/or verified for accuracy and completeness by another independent contractor. In addition
to the fiscal drain on the Superfund Program that this causes, we are also likely to be faced in cost recovery litigation
with a defense argument that such ``double expense'' is unnecessary and unrecoverable. This may also increase the
time and expense that the litigation and negotiation require, not including the potential millions of dollars at
risk during the cost recovery/enforcement action itself.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Still another conflict case in which cost recovery litigation was adversely impacted involved a subcontractor who
was performing PRP searches, negotiation support, and oversight of PRP work on a site for the EPA. The subcontractor
not only had a significant financial relationship with the PRPs of that site, but was also representing and performing
related work for the PRPs on the same site. The repercussions of this conflict involved not only a significant delay
in the Agency's ability to cleanup the site, but also tens of thousands of dollars in transition costs to remove and
replace the subcontractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's concerns regarding conflicts of interest are very real. As EPA continues to clean up the environment and to try
to recover the costs of the cleanup from PRPs, EPA seeks, through this rule, to protect the public from delays and increased
costs. For example, EPA contractors may perform remedial design work for EPA by developing plans and specifications
for a selected cleanup remedy at a site. If that contractor also works for a PRP to assess the contamination at the same
site, EPA, PRPs, and the public may question the integrity and objectivity of the work the contractor has performed
for EPA. Moreover, EPA could face difficulty in utilizing the contractor's expertise and experience in supporting
the merits of EPA's enforcement case. Judges and juries may doubt the credibility of a factual or expert witness who
has performed conflicting work and may have inconsistent opinions. Another example of how EPA's enforcement could
be jeopardized in the future would be if a contractor who performs technical enforcement support for EPA, including
searches for and case histories of PRPs, subsequently or concurrently worked for the PRP on the same case. Again, contractors
performing this and other types of Superfund work are often privy to sensitive EPA litigation information and case
management plans and could divulge such information to the PRP. If such information was leaked or otherwise divulged
intentionally or unintentionally, the Government's case may be damaged by disclosure to the PRP of litigation strategy.
In addition, if documents deemed confidential and privileged were released, such documents could then be admitted
into evidence in opposition to the Government's case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with commenters that the Agency has not considered the balance between the cost of the rule and the benefits
to EPA of avoiding conflicts. We believe there must be uniform regulatory requirements to raise contractors' awareness
and understanding of conflict of interest problems and the procedures needed to prevent them. Over the past few years,
the development of this rule with its strong conflict of interest provisions has created a heightened sensitivity
to conflict of interest matters throughout EPA's programs and the contractor community. As a result, we are already
seeing an increase in contractors reporting of potential conflicts to the Agency. Certainly, with the tremendous
cost of cleaning up the environment, we need to ensure the integrity of our procurement program and cannot afford to
jeopardize our enforcement actions and impede PRP cleanup of hazardous waste sites. EPA has seriously considered
the cost of the rule and has worked to minimize the rule's burden to the contractor community, yet ensure adequate protection
of its programs.

4. Pending FAR Regulations and Consistency With OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters expressed concern with the publication of EPA's rule prior to the publication of the pending FAR regulations,
and some expressed concern that the proposed rule is inconsistent with and goes beyond the existing regulations and
OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1. On October 22, 1990, the interim regulations were published as FAC 90&hyph;1, amending
the FAR subpart 9.5 on conflicts of interest. On October 25, 1991, the interim rule was converted to a final rule. We
have carefully reviewed our rule to ensure its harmony with FAR subpart 9.5. The rule specifically addresses the unique
requirements of the Superfund program which are not covered by other regulations. To safeguard our enforcement actions
and ensure the integrity of our cleanup program, it is essential that we monitor not only conflicts of interest prior
to award, but also conflicts during and after performance. These special provisions are not inconsistent with FAR
subpart 9.5.

5. Definition of Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments concerned the definition of types of conflicts of interest. The term ``conflict of interest''
in this rule has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same definition as contained in FAR Subpart 9.5. EPA has not adopted any unique or agency specific definitions for
types of conflicts of interest. EPA also has included the term ``personal conflicts of interest'' which is not defined
in the FAR. For clarity, we have provided a definition of personal conflict of interest in EPAAR Clause 1552.209&hyph;73,
Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel. A personal conflict of interest is ``a relationship
of an employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant with an entity that may impair the objectivity of the employee,
subcontractor employee, or consultant in performing the contract work.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Apparent Conflict of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters objected to the expansion of conflict of interest to include the term ``apparent'' and indicated
that the term was too vague and was not defined in the rule. To be consistent with FAR Subpart 9.5, this term has been removed
from the rule. Nevertheless, EPA strongly supports the OFPP approach on this issue and will fully comply with section
6(d) of OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1, which mandates, ``Federal procurement officials shall encourage contractors
to consider carefully the potential for conflicts of interest in all of their activities associated with federal
procurement, and shall be sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest in any contracting actions.'' A comment
was also received which stressed that contractors that work for both private and public parties should avoid and mitigate
both actual conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts in order to protect the public interest. Accordingly,
our contractors should be sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest in all contract actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Potential and Actual Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters took exception to EPA's inclusion of the term ``potential'' to describe a particular type of conflict
as being too vague and overly restrictive, and one commenter stated that the term ``actual conflict'' was undefined
and contrary to the FAR. We disagree and are retaining the terms in the rule. The concept of potential conflicts is well
established in acquisition regulations. FAR Subpart 9.5 provides examples of situations involving potential conflicts
of interest and also includes the term ``actual'' conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Significant Conflict of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters recommended that EPA only be concerned with the reporting of significant conflicts of interest.
We disagree. It is unacceptable for contractors to report only conflicts which they consider significant. All actual
and potential conflicts of interest that are identified must be reported to the appropriate EPA Contracting Officer.
In accordance with the process set out in FAR Section 9.504, the EPA Contracting Officer identifies and evaluates
conflicts, makes a determination of whether a conflict is significant and determines if the conflict can be avoided,
mitigated, or neutralized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Restriction of Contracting Officer's Decision Making Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments received expressed concern that the rule will infringe upon or eliminate the Contracting Officer's
decision making authority on conflicts of interest. In particular, the comments stressed that it is important that
Contracting Officers make decisions on a case-by-case basis and that EPA is abrogating its responsibilities by placing
the full burden on contractors to disclose conflicts of interest no matter how insignificant or immaterial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this rule restricts the Contracting Officer from making decisions on conflicts of interest on a case-by-case
basis. In fact, Contracting Officers are required to make decisions on a case-by-case basis in accordance with FAR
subpart 9.5. The existing EPAAR requires contractor disclosure of conflicts and the rule does not change this responsibility.
This disclosure requirement does not mean that the Contracting Officer will find that every reported conflict is
significant or that it cannot be avoided, neutralized, or effectively mitigated, but rather allows the Contracting
Officer the opportunity to carefully evaluate the facts of each case and make an informed determination that protects
our programs and the public interest. Clearly, both EPA and its contractors have a continuing responsibility to identify
and prevent conflicts of interest in federal procurement. However, it is not feasible or practicable for EPA to routinely
search and review contractors' business records to unearth conflicts. Such action would be inappropriate and intrusive.
Therefore, as a practical matter, we must require contractors to report conflicts.

10. Limitation of Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that EPA revise the rule to address disclosure of client information regarding the same
subject matter as the instant solicitation, or directly relating to such subject matter as the instant solicitation.
The commenter recommended either limiting disclosure to information connected to the solicitation or to work performed
in the same state or region where the work for EPA will be performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requires disclosure of conflict of interest information related to the work performed or that will be performed
for EPA. We do not require the submission of unrelated client or other information. All that is required is sufficient
information for the EPA Contracting Officer to make an informed conflict of interest determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Disclosure of Client Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment raised the concern that contractors may be unable to divulge work performed for clients and the dollar
value, since this information as well as client lists are routinely claimed to be confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not require the release of client lists or the reporting of the dollar value of work performed for clients.
Rather, we require that a contractor disclose sufficient information to the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting
Officer can make an informed decision. In most cases, this would involve the name of a client creating the potential
conflict or the contractor, particularly if the client is a PRP on the site, and information regarding the nature of
the work. Each case is different and there may be occasions where a client routinely claims confidentiality for the
release of its name and other information concerning the conflict. If a disclosure waiver cannot be obtained from
the client, the contractor should explore with the Contracting Officer suitable alternatives for providing information
sufficient to permit the Contracting Officer to render an informed decision on the conflict. We urge contractors
to identify confidential business information and stress that EPA is committed to protecting sensitive business
and other information to the full extent permitted by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Availability of PRP Listings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed the concern that contractors can not identify all conflicts of interest unless EPA informs
contractors of all of the PRPs and of the possibility of future enforcement actions. They further stated that contractors
are unable to sign the certifications accurately unless they know these facts. Several commenters also suggested
that to avoid delays in contractor disclosure and certifications, EPA should furnish up-to-date listings of PRPs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA acknowledges the fact that PRPs are continually being identified and that contractors will not always have sufficient
knowledge of all PRPs at the time certification is submitted. We require contractors to certify to the best of their
knowledge and belief at the time of the certification. It is not EPA's intention to hold a contractor accountable for
information which the contractor did not know or have reason to know at the time the certification was executed. We
wish to stress, however, that disclosure of conflicts is a continuing obligation, and certification is a statement
that should demonstrate a contractor has made a good faith effort to disclose all potential conflicts of interest.
In order to alleviate contractors' concerns, the time period for the submission of the work assignment certification
has been extended to permit a more reasonable time period for contractors to contact EPA and obtain the most current
information concerning PRPs and future enforcement actions pertaining to sites identified in the work assignments
or contract. The term ``work assignment'' in this rule includes other similar tasking documents such as a delivery
order or a technical direction document. EPA is committed to providing contractors with the list of known PRPs for
sites at the time of work assignment issuance. EPA is currently working to make available to all Contracting Officers
the Superfund Enforcement Tracking System (SETS) report, which tracks PRPs by site. This report is available to the
public through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia.

13. Period of Record for Conflict of Interest Checks
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested clarification of the period to be searched for organizational and personal conflicts of
interest. The commenter suggested that the organizational check include all prior work performed by the contractor
but that the personal conflict of interest check be limited to the period of time that the individual is employed by
the company or for a one year period, whichever is greater.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with FAR 9.5, EPA will require all contractors who have at least three years of records to search back
through the immediately preceding three years of records. For contractors who do not have three years of records to
search, a transition period for searches will be implemented requiring the contractor to search any records that
it has until, over time, three years of records are accumulated. Contractors, however, are always required to report
any conflicts of which they are aware. We emphasize that a contractor is not required to collect, maintain or search
records on personal conflicts of interest. The requirement on the contractor is to inform its employees, performing
work under or related to EPA contracts, of their obligation to report conflicts of interest. It is the employees' responsibility
to review their current and past activities and to report potential conflicts of interest to their employers.

14. Elimination of Conflicts by Full Disclosure of Contractor Roles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that EPA should focus on full disclosure of roles, since where full and open disclosure of a contractor's
role exists no conflict of interest can occur. We disagree. Although we certainly believe in openness regarding the
role of contractors in EPA's procurement program, we fail to see how full disclosure of the role of contractors eliminates
the existence of conflicts. Rather, it is contractor disclosure of potential conflicts to EPA that provides the opportunity
to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many comments were received recommending the establishment of a centralized decision making function with an administrative
contracting officer at EPA headquarters having the responsibility for decisions on all conflict of interest requests.
It was pointed out that this would achieve consistency in conflict of interest determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have seriously considered this as an option and have rejected it. A central administrative contracting officer
would not have the necessary background or knowledge of the individual contracts to make well informed conflict of
interest determinations. We believe that a decentralized approach to conflict of interest decision making, where
determinations are made by the EPA Contracting Officer for the contract on a case-by-case basis, is the more effective
approach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested that meaningful objective standards be adopted to evaluate significant personal and organizational
conflicts of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAR subpart 9.5 provides definitions and general rules pertaining to conflict of interest, but do not include objective
standards. Conflict of interest is a subject for which objective standards are difficult to formulate. However,
this does not mean that conflicts cannot be described through definitions and general rules. In addition to the examples
included in the FAR, EPA Contracting Officers receive training and assistance on conflict of interest issues from
the conflict of interest staff within EPA's Office of Acquisition Management. Therefore, Contracting Officers
will have available examples and precedents to assist them in their conflict of interest determinations.

One commenter expressed concern that EPA would not have the resources to efficiently administer the rule, and other
commenters recommended that EPA provide examples of conflicts of interest to help Contracting Officers respond
consistently and wisely and prevent delays associated with these new regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the Agency has sufficient staff to administer these regulations. In the past, response times were sometimes
delayed not because of a lack of resources but because of insufficient training and experience. EPA is committed to
a comprehensive conflict of interest training program for its Contracting Officers and project personnel. The training
will include a collection of case studies and examples upon which to base conflict of interest decisions.

Another commenter, expressing support for the rule, suggested that the EPA should consider and clarify how the provisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule applies only to contracts awarded by EPA. EPA can encourage the use of similar provisions in contracts for
Superfund work awarded by other agencies or States. However, it cannot require agencies or States to include similar
provisions in those contracts. EPA is currently exploring the possibility of including its clauses in agreements
that pertain to Superfund work in contracts awarded by other agencies or States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that the rule apply to EPA contracts only and have no bearing on work performed for other
Federal agencies. It was pointed out that the rule lacks a discussion of how the restrictions in this rule bear on the
ability of contractors to seek similar work from other Federal agencies and the States. Particular concern was raised
that EPA not restrict its contractors from working simultaneously for other agencies such as the Department of Energy
(DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD) since this would be contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is committed to working closely with other agencies and States to ensure the effective and expedited cleanup
of hazardous waste sites throughout the country and encourages the use of the best cleanup technology available.
It is not our intention to restrict EPA contractors from working for the public sector. We strongly encourage contractors
to perform work for other Federal agencies and States when such work does not create a conflict of interest problem
which would impair the contractor's objectivity in performing work for EPA or damage the integrity of the EPA's cleanup
and enforcement actions. We have intentionally made no distinction between the public and private sector in the rule's
reporting requirements. To safeguard our programs, we must require that all actual or potential conflicts of interest
be identified, avoided, mitigated, or neutralized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has the responsibility to ensure compliance by Federal and State agencies with the requirements of CERCLA
and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. Because of EPA's enforcement responsibility, the interests of
EPA and other public organizations will not always be parallel and may at times be distinctly at odds. For example,
the interests of the EPA and DOD or DOE may be very different regarding the terms of Federal Facility cleanup agreements.
Therefore, it is important that our contractors are not placed in conflict situations. When an actual or potential
conflict of interest exists with work that a contractor may wish to perform with another organization, whether public
or private, the contractor shall report it to its EPA Contracting Officer so that an informed determination can be
made based on a careful review of the facts, the legal and program considerations, and the best interest of the United
States.

20. Qualified Contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that EPA may not attract the most qualified contractors or best expertise as a result of implementing
the conflict of interest regulations. We disagree. EPA promotes full and open competition and attracts the most highly
qualified contractors to its procurement program. Securing qualified contractors and eliminating conflicts of
interest are not opposing goals. In fact, most of the highly qualified firms which compete for EPA contracts have systems
established within their organizations to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest.

21. Flow Down of the Clause to Subcontractors and Consultants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters stated that the categories of subcontractors and consultants exempted from the flow down of
the conflict of interest clauses are too limited. They specifically questioned why the ``non-discretionary technical
or engineering services, including treatability studies,'' exempted in the proposed clause, EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;74,
Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC), are not included in the flow down exemptions of all of the rule's conflict
of interest clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this rule, we carefully evaluated the types of work performed by subcontractors and consultants under
EPA's contracts, and identified certain classes of work that pose a minimal risk of conflict of interest. They include
well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, and electrical services. We
exempted these classes from the flow down provisions of all of the rule's EPAAR conflict of interest clauses. In addition,
for the LOFC clause only, we also exempted subcontractors and consultants who perform ``non-discretionary technical
and engineering services, including treatability studies.'' Although we believe that non-discretionary technical
and engineering services could pose some risk to the Agency, particularly since this category is so broad, we were
able to exempt this work from the LOFC clause because sufficient protection was provided through coverage by the basic
conflict of interest clauses, (EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;71 Organizational Conflicts of Interest, EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;73
Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel, and EPAAR 1552.227&hyph;76 Project Employee Confidentiality
Agreement.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of ``treatability studies'', we recognize that this type of work may have a high risk of conflict of interest,
yet we believe it is in the public interest to promote innovative technology and exempt such subcontract work from
any limitations on future contracting. However, because there may be a high risk of conflict for this type of work,
it is essential that protection is provided by flow down of the basic conflict of interest clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Expansion of the Class of Exemptions for Subcontractor Flow Down 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested that we broaden the classes of work to be exempt from the flow down requirements which
apply to subcontractors and consultants in all of the conflict of interest clauses. Some provided specific suggestions
of additional categories to be exempted including: Laboratory services, industrial hygiene, selected geotechnical
consulting, medical surveillance, transportation services, and graphics printing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have given serious consideration to the commenters' recommendations and believe that categorically exempting
these types of work from flow down would pose an unacceptable risk of conflict of interest to the Agency. For example,
if a laboratory services subcontractor were also providing environmental consulting services for a specific site
in support of a PRP's legal position, it would be a conflict of interest for the same subcontractor to then take or analyze
samples for the EPA from the same site. In addition, if a transportation subcontractor has a relationship with a disposal
facility that is a PRP on a site, it would be a conflict of interest for that same transportation subcontractor to also
perform work at or relating to the site for EPA, or involving the disposal facility. Each of the other recommended categories
also poses such risks, and the Agency cannot categorically exempt them. However, we recognize there may be special
cases in which these type of activities can be excluded and each clause allows for Contracting Officers to authorize
such exemptions. Thus, we have added a provision permitting a contractor to request in writing that the Contracting
Officer exempt from the flow-down requirements of the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses a particular subcontract
or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically exempted in the
clauses, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-by-case
basis, before approving or disapproving the request.

23. Costs Associated With Flow Down of Clauses to Subcontractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern about the costs associated with the flow down requirements of the rule's clauses. One
commenter asked if EPA is willing to pay for the costs associated with the LOFC flow down provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The allowable and allocable costs associated with this rule may be chargeable to EPA contracts in accordance with
the provisions of FAR part 31. This would also apply to allowable and allocable costs associated with this rule, which
are incurred by non-exempt subcontractors or consultants, except that such costs would be submitted to EPA's prime
contractor rather than to EPA. We anticipate that costs associated with future contracting requests under an LOFC
clause will be minimal and would be performed as a part of the normal bid and proposal effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
24. Expansion of Subcontractor Flow Down Exemption To Apply To Prime Contractors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters also requested that prime contractors be exempt from the LOFC or other conflict of interest clauses
when work to be performed under the prime contract is one of the exemptions identified in the flow down section of the
clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. EPA prime contracts include a wide variety of tasks, many of which pose a high risk for conflict of interest.
However, in the unlikely event that an EPA prime contractor only performed the type of work exempted in a specific subcontractor
flow down provision, the contractor could request from the Contracting Officer an exemption from inclusion of that
conflict of interest clause.

25. Small and Minority Business Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raised concern that the rule conflicts with the EPA Administrator's initiative to provide more work
to small and minority owned businesses and with Congressional intent to promote contracting with small business.
The commenters asserted that small firms cannot absorb the high costs of maintaining complex conflict of interest
systems. Other commenters expressed concern that the LOFC clause will hurt small businesses that need local markets
because small businesses do not have the operational breadth that larger firms possess to avoid regions where conflicts
may exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is essential that we avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts of interest in all EPA contracting. However, we recognize
the importance of small and minority owned businesses and strongly support their active participation in our procurement
programs. We are currently implementing a Long Term Contracting Strategy for the Superfund program that will enhance
the competitive environment and provide greater opportunities for small business participation by creating smaller,
regionally based contracts and subcontracting opportunities under these contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small businesses currently participate in the Superfund and other EPA programs primarily as subcontractors. As
detailed in our discussion of flow down exemptions, a number of categories of subcontracts are specifically exempt
from the requirements of the entire rule and ``non-discretionary technical and engineering services'' subcontract
work is exempt from all LOFC clause provisions. This substantially minimizes cost and associated burdens for many
small businesses participating in our programs at both the local and national level. Moreover, at any time, a small
business operating as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor may request waiver of clause requirements for
nondiscretionary work which poses a minimal risk of conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not require any special type of system to identify and report conflicts. Each contractor determines its own
procedures for searching and identifying conflicts of interest, and in some cases, it may already have a process in
place to identify conflicts in its commercial business. We anticipate that the scope of a company's procedures would
be commensurate with the company's size and complexity, and for small businesses any system would be less complex
and detailed.

26. Applicability of Rule to Related Organizations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received concerning the applicability of the rule to affiliates and other related organizations.
A few commenters encouraged EPA to publish a uniform policy regarding the disclosure burden of contractors for work
performed by parent and affiliate corporations as well as partnerships and other businesses. Most commenters opposed
the burden of extending disclosure to conflicts of interest associated with related organizations, and stressed
that it may be difficult to obtain information from affiliates regardless of common ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues regarding applicability of the rule to related organizations are complex. The rule does not specifically
address related organizations, and it is not our intent to extend search and certification requirements to related
organizations and create unnecessary reporting burdens. However, we do require our contractors to make a good faith
effort to report conflicts as they are identified. If an EPA contractor is aware of a potential conflict or has reason
to believe a related organization may create a conflict of interest for the contractor, checking with that organization
to verify whether a conflict exists would certainly be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a contractor reports a conflict of interest involving a related organization and includes information which is
designated as sensitive or proprietary, the EPA will protect such information from unauthorized disclosure. An
opportunity to so mark such information shall be afforded to the submitter of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
27. Application of the Rule to Other Units of a contractor's Organization Which Do Not Perform Environmental Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted to know the extent to which the rule applies to other units of a contractor's organization which
do not perform environmental work. The commenter further stated that it is unfair to restrict service areas of a firm
that are unrelated to environmental consulting work or to the contractor unit working on an EPA contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule applies to the corporation or other legal entity that has entered into a contract with EPA, and makes no distinction
between separate divisions or units of the EPA contractor's organization. The fact that a part of the organization
does not perform environmental work does not necessarily mean it would not have a conflict of interest. EPA only restricts
its contractors from work which poses a significant conflict of interest to the Agency. We require our contractors
to identify all potential conflicts of interest and notify the EPA prior to entering into a contract for types of work
identified in the LOFC clause as posing a significant risk of conflict. This provides the EPA an opportunity to evaluate
such work and prevent conflicts that may jeopardize work performed for EPA or ongoing enforcement actions.

28. Establishment of New Organizational Units To Avoid Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comment was received that expressed concern about a contractor establishing new ``units'' with the purpose of allowing
the contractor to perform in different program areas where it might otherwise be precluded due to a conflict of interest.
The comment included a suggestion that there should be a deterrent to allowing this type of loophole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requires that contractors report to the EPA Contracting Officer all potential conflicts of interest with work
performed for EPA. While there may be instances where an organizational conflict of interest may be mitigated effectively,
all such potential conflict situations must be reported to the EPA so that the Contracting Officer can make an informed
determination based on a careful evaluation of the facts and program and enforcement concerns.

29. Contractor Authority To Decline EPA Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that an EPA contractor should be allowed to decline specific work assignments because of a conflict
with other work that the contractor may have accepted after the EPA contract was awarded. We disagree. The contractor
does not have the discretion to reject a work assignment. The contractor must report all conflicts of interest to the
EPA Contracting Officer who evaluates conflicts, makes a determination of whether a conflict is significant and
determines if the conflict can be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized. Under the terms of an EPA contract, a contractor
is required to accept and perform work issued under work assignments. Where there is an overriding public interest
to perform the work when a conflict of interest exists, the Contracting Officer may decide that the work should be performed
despite the inability to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict. For example, if an emergency situation exists
and immediate action is needed to stabilize a site to prevent injury to nearby residents, the Contracting Officer
may determine that performance on the work assignment is necessary regardless of the contractor's inability to avoid,
mitigate, or neutralize a conflict at the site.

30. Contractor's Right To Stop Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that a contractor should have the right to stop performance if it reasonably believes that there
would not be a significant impact upon the Agency as a result of the work stoppage. We disagree. The contract requires
performance, and work may be stopped only by the Contracting Officer. The Government's right to control costs incurred
as a result of stopping work must be protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
31. Time Limit for Responding to Conflict of Interest Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated there should be a time limit, such as three or ten days, established for Contracting Officers
to respond to any conflict of interest notification or LOFC request. Commenters further suggested that contractors
should be able to assume that approval, if required, has been given if a response has not been received from EPA within
ten days. The commenters stated that contractors may not only be placed in a position which may cause them to lose business
due to slow responses by EPA, but also may be subject to bid bond forfeitures or other penalties for failure to accept
a contract if time limits are not included in the rule. Also, for Federal contracts, contractors may risk having their
bids found non-responsive if the bid is conditioned upon EPA granting approval to enter into the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since each conflict of interest situation is unique and has varying degrees of complexity and because contractors
often do not initially provide sufficient information for a Contracting Officer to make a timely decision, the establishment
of an arbitrary time limit is not appropriate. We do not agree with the suggestion that failure to respond within ten
days should automatically be interpreted as approval. Arbitrary time limits can result in procedural questions
over submission and receipt dates and create delays. Although set response times are not included in the rule, EPA
is committed to providing timely responses. We have clarified our LOFC clauses to indicate that contractors may seek
an expedited response regarding their initial LOFC requests by submitting their requests to the Contracting Officer
and the next level within the Contracting Officer's organization.

32. Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments recommended that EPA institute an appeal process for contractors that want a review of an adverse
conflict of interest decision made by a Contracting Officer. The decision on any conflict of interest determination
is the responsibility of the EPA Contracting Officer. We have clarified the review process available for LOFC requests
if a contractor disagrees with the decision of a Contracting Officer. The contractor may file a request with the Contracting
Officer for reconsideration or the contractor may request that a Contracting Officer determination be reviewed
at a higher administrative level. Filing a request for reconsideration however, does not preclude a contractor from
seeking review at the next administrative level. The LOFC clause has been modified to include the review process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received which took exception to a unilateral placement of conflict of interest clauses into existing
contracts. EPA does not intend to unilaterally place the new EPAAR clauses into existing contracts. Clauses substantially
similar to these clauses shall be negotiated by the Contracting Officer for existing contracts, on a case-by-case
basis, as stated in the general prescription to the clauses. The general prescription to the clauses, cited in the
proposed rule as paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses, is redesignated,
under the final rule, as EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering changes to FAR
Subpart 9.5.

34. General Comments Concerning Improper Restriction of Competition and Its Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern about a restriction of competition on Superfund work resulting from this rule. Commenters
also stated that EPA has improperly restricted competition by placing overly broad future contracting limitations
affecting sites, types of contracts, and parties with whom the contractor may contract. Commenters questioned the
authority to impose ``post contract'' restrictions and stated that such activity should be governed by internal
guidelines and market forces. Others stated that these clauses prevent EPA from having access to the most qualified
sources in its contracting program. Other comments reflected an interpretation that the restrictions apply to affiliates
and to contractor clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with these comments. The LOFC clause and its alternates are not overly broad nor do they improperly restrict
competition. The LOFC clause and each alternate are focused narrowly upon areas which have a high potential for conflict.
The authority for ``post contract'' restriction is recognized in FAR Section 9.507. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many EPA Superfund solicitations and contracts currently include clauses similar to those contained in this rule.
EPA has attracted qualified contractors and competition has not diminished. The comment concerning the limitation
of competition based upon the flow down of restrictions to affiliates or to clients reflects an assumption based upon
a misreading of the proposed rule. There is no flow down of restrictions to affiliates or to clients.

35. Negotiation of Specific LOFC Clauses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested that the LOFC clause be negotiated separately for each contract. This will occur for existing
contracts. However, the rule's EPAAR clauses are required for all solicitations and new contracts. The Contracting
Officer may, however, consider a deviation to the inclusion or for the modification of the clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
36. Assessment of the Cost and Economic Impacts of Limiting Work on Existing Contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters were concerned about the limitation on business as a result of the inclusion of the LOFC clauses in existing
contracts. One commenter stated that an assessment of the economic impacts of the rule has not been performed for existing
contracts. The commenter further stated that the limitations contained in the LOFC clause, which will be included
by modification into existing contracts, will adversely affect its future activities. The commenter's concern
is that these effects were not envisioned by the contractor at the time it submitted its offer to the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule states that the EPAAR clauses are to be placed in all solicitations and new contracts unless a deviation is
obtained. For contracts existing as of the effective date of the rule, clauses substantially similar to those in the
rule are to be negotiated and incorporated into those contracts, on a case-by-case basis. EPA will not unilaterally
incorporate these new clauses into existing contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the cost and economic impacts of the rule, EPA has performed a cost burden analysis of the rule and recognizes
that there will be some economic impact as a result of implementing these clauses. During the formulation of the LOFC
clause for each existing contract, the negotiation process will assure that any specific economic attributes associated
with the contract are taken into consideration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To respond to these concerns, we have made significant reductions in the proposed rule's certification requirements.
Under the final rule, all Superfund contractors are required to submit certifications, but they are no longer required
to submit both annual and work assignment certifications. In addition, the requirement for work plan certifications
has been eliminated, and the number of work assignment certifications has been reduced. Under the final rule, a work
assignment certification is required within 20 days from the time the contractor receives a work assignment. If a
subsequent work assignment is issued to the contractor under the same contract for additional work at the same site(s)
covered by the initial work assignment, an additional certification for the new work assignment is not required.
This is not intended to relieve the contractor from reporting any future conflicts of interest relating to the site(s).
The contractor will still be expected to search and report any conflicts of interest based upon new information which
has been identified. These certification changes will significantly reduce the burden on contractors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
38. Multiple Sites Under Work Assignments, Addition of Sites to a Work Assignment and the Allocation of Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter expressed concern that since sites and PRPs may be added to the work assignments during performance,
contractors cannot certify at the work assignment acceptance phase that all conflicts have been disclosed. This
concern also applies to a multi-site work assignment where sites are identified as the work arises. The commenter
also expressed concern about the recovery of costs incurred for records retention pertaining to sites under multi-site
contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The work assignment clause requires that the contractor certify to the best of its knowledge and belief that all conflicts
of interest have been reported or that no conflicts of interest exist. We recognize that all site and PRP information
may not be available at the time of the certification, which under the final rule is 20 days after the contractor receives
the work assignment. If a site is added to the work assignment after the certification is submitted, a subsequent certification
is not required for the additional site. The certification includes a statement that the contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any conflicts arising during performance of the work assignment pertaining
to all sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable costs associated with work performed under the contract, including records retention pertaining to sites,
shall be allocated consistent with the contractor's cost accounting system. Since work assignments are so diverse,
questions concerning the proper allocability of costs on a specific work assignment should be directed to the Contracting
Officer.

39. Cost to Contractors Associated With Requesting Approval for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future Work After Contract Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received concerning the reimbursement of costs associated with the submission of LOFC requests,
filed after the expiration of the EPA contract. Another commenter expressed concern about costs contractors may
incur as a result of involvement in future litigation matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LOFC clause identifies work that is high risk to the Agency. The purpose of this clause is to avoid conflicts that
jeopardize the Superfund program and EPA's enforcement efforts. After expiration of the contract or work assignment,
contractors only have to request approval for future contracting identified in the LOFC clause. Costs associated
with this approval process should be minimal and would be performed as a part of the normal bid and proposal effort.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of costs associated with future involvement in litigation matters is not within the scope of this rule. However,
generally if EPA requires expert witness or special litigation support for a Superfund case, it would enter into a
contract for such services. For costs associated with other witness testimony, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would apply.

40. FAR Coverage of Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the FAR requires detailed paperwork only when necessary to examine ``significant potential
conflicts'' and to determine appropriate mitigation measures. We agree. In accordance with FAR section 9.505, EPA's
Contracting Officers examine each situation on the basis of its particular facts and exercise common sense, good
judgment and sound discretion in order to minimize the paperwork burden. Only information which is sufficient to
permit the Contracting Officer to identify and evaluate conflicts of interest shall be requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
41. Paperwork Requirement and EPA Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the paperwork required violates the Paperwork Reduction Act and is unnecessary to achieve
EPA's program objectives. We do not agree. EPA has not violated the Paperwork Reduction Act and has made every effort
to minimize the paperwork burden associated with this rule consistent with achieving its objectives in the area of
conflict of interest. The final rule reflects a substantial reduction in the paperwork burden to contractors participating
in EPA's procurement program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
42. Paperwork Burden Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters expressed concerns about the burden the rule would impose upon contractors. Several commenters
stated that EPA's burden estimate was too low. One commenter stated that its conflict of interest review effort required
much less time than that which was estimated by EPA. Others offered suggestions on how EPA could reduce the paperwork
burden and still accomplish its objectives. These suggestions included elimination of duplicative certifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered these suggestions and has made significant reductions to the paperwork burden associated with
this rule. Under the final rule, contractors will not be required to submit certifications on both an annual and a work
assignment basis. In addition, the work plan certification requirement has been eliminated from the proposed rule's
amendment to the work assignment clause. Under the final rule, a single certification will be submitted within twenty
days from the time the contractor receives the work assignment, and it will cover conflicts of interest for all effort
to be performed or related to sites under the work assignment. Furthermore, if a subsequent work assignment is issued
to the contractor under the same contract for additional work at the same site, an additional certification for the
new work assignment is not required. The initial certification is sufficient because it requires a continuing obligation
by the contractor to report any conflicts associated with the site(s). The paperwork burden associated with the LOFC
clause and its alternates has been reduced because the time frames for requesting approval commence at the conclusion
of the work assignment instead of the expiration date of the contract. In many cases, this will reduce the LOFC request
period by several years. In the final rule, EPA has also eliminated the requirement for an annual update of the conflict
of interest plan in order to reduce reporting requirements.

43. Data Base Searches and Cost Reimbursement for Paperwork Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that contractor data bases do not contain the type of information that EPA is requesting and, therefore,
contractors would not be able to provide complete certifications on conflicts of interest. Other commenters expressed
concerns that the development of data bases and the other administrative costs associated with the rule will not be
recovered by the contractors and have not been included in the total cost for conflict of interest systems. They recommended

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that EPA provide a mechanism for contractors to recoup these costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not require that contractors establish any particular kind of information retrieval system. EPA recognizes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contractors often do not have all of the information readily accessible upon which to base their certifications.
Therefore, the certifications contain the statement that the contractor is certifying to the best of its knowledge
and belief as of the date of the certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the costs associated with the rule and a conflict of interest system, the rule states that costs associated
with conflicts of interest may be chargeable to Government contracts under the provisions of FAR Part 31. Following
the expiration of the contract, no certifications are required. For expired contracts, which involved efforts at
sites, the costs associated with search effort associated with the LOFC clause should be minimal. These post contract
costs would normally be allocated to the contractor's bid and proposal pool.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a description of the final rule's EPAAR clauses and our response to comments on the specific clauses
and their prescriptions which are not addressed in the preceding general comments section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;71, Organizational Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is modified to specify that notification of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest should be
made prior to commencement of work. However, in emergency situations, work may begin with notification being made
within five work days. The clause also identifies specific subcontracts and consultant agreements for which this
clause is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment, the following changes have been made to the proposed modification of this clause and
its prescription:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed from this clause and all other clauses in the rule in response to comments that
the term is vague and difficult to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(1) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses,
has been redesignated as paragraph (a), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause. In addition, the reference to FAR
9.508&hyph;2 has been removed from this paragraph since FAC 90&hyph;1 removed this section from the FAR. These minor
changes have been made to conform with the numbering changes to FAR subpart 9.5 based on FAC 90&hyph;1, and are in accord
with public comments urging that the final rule be consistent with any changes to the FAR.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Clarification of ``any work''. One commenter requested that the term ``any work'' in paragraph (b) of the clause
be clarified. ``Any work'' would generally refer to any billable hours to the issued work assignment. The term ``work
assignment'' in this rule includes other similar tasking documents such as a delivery order or a technical direction
document. Our intent is for contractors to report potential conflicts prior to beginning work on a contract or a work
assignment issued under a contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Immediate reporting of whether a conflict of interest exists. Some commenters objected to EPA's requiring the
immediate reporting of whether or not a conflict of interest exists and recommended that such reporting not be required
until ten days after a work assignment is issued. Some also pointed out the difficulty in responding without knowledge
of future assignments and access to reliable data on PRPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. Conflicts of interest must be identified immediately so we can avoid issuing work when a conflict exists.
We recognize that contractors may not always have sufficient information to identify all conflicts when work assignments
are issued since PRPs are continually being identified, but this should not delay a good faith disclosure of any conflicts
that can be identified prior to beginning work. Moreover, in response to comments, the final rule does not require
contractors to certify regarding conflicts of interest related to work assignments until 20 days after receipt of
the work assignment. (See EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments, Alternate I.) Additionally, it should be noted
that in emergency situations contractors may begin work immediately with notification to follow within five days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Removal of Alternate I to paragraph (e). One commenter recommended that Alternate I of paragraph (e) of the clause,
which applies to non-Superfund contracts, be removed. We disagree. Since the types of work exempted from flow down
in paragraph (e) are unlikely to be performed in non-Superfund contracts, it would be confusing to include this language
in such contracts. In the event these types of work are included in the contract, the Contracting Officer may authorize
exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;73, Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is added for Superfund contracts to ensure that contractors notify the Contracting Officer of actual or potential
personal conflicts of interest prior to incurring costs for an employee where the contractor is aware that the employee
has a personal conflict of interest. The clause also identifies specific subcontracts and consultant agreements
for which this clause is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment, the following changes have been made:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Paragraph (a) has been modified slightly to make the language clearer that the provisions with regard to employee
personnel performing under this contract shall apply until the earlier ``of the following two dates: the termination
date of the affected employee(s) or the expiration date of this contract.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Paragraph (b) has been rewritten to clarify that a contractor is responsible for reporting personal conflicts of
interest regarding its subcontractor employees and consultants when such conflicts have been reported to the contractor.
This clarification is made in response to public concern that a contractor is unlikely to have knowledge of the personal
conflicts of interest of its subcontractors' employees and should not be held responsible for identifying such personal
conflicts of interest unless they have been brought to its attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(2) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses,
has been redesignated as paragraph (b), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering
changes to FAR Subpart 9.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription language to this clause has also been changed to be consistent with the prescription to the Organizational
Conflict of Interest Clause. The final prescription, paragraph (b), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2 Contract clause, includes
a small purchase limitation threshold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Personal conflict of interest certification and disclosure. A number of commenters expressed concern that it
is unfair and too burdensome to require contractors to certify that all personal conflicts had been reported. They
stressed that since contractors have to rely on their employees to report such conflicts that all that should be required
is a good faith effort to obtain such information. Some requested that disclosure be limited to those personal conflicts
of which the contractor has knowledge. A concern was also raised that prime contractors should not be put in a position
to certify that there are no personal conflicts of interest regarding subcontractor employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree and have eliminated the personal conflict of interest certification that was included as part of the annual
certification and the work plan/work assignment certification in the proposed rule. Under the final rule, all that
contractors must certify, as part of either a work assignment or annual conflict of interest certification, is that
they have informed their employees, working under the requirements of the work assignment or EPA contract, of their
obligation to report organizational and personal conflicts of interest. (See EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments.
Alternate I, and EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;80, Annual Certification.) When a contractor has been informed of a personal
conflict, either by an employee or a subcontractor, or has knowledge of such a conflict, it should then report this
to the EPA Contracting Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicability of Privacy Act of 1974 and collection of records. One commenter raised concern that this clause could
have the effect of requiring contractors to develop and maintain ``systems of records [as defined in the Privacy Act
of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a)] on individuals on behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency function.'' Commenters also
stated that the systems of records needed would be excessively burdensome. Some also expressed concern about the
flow down provisions of the clause to subcontractors in terms of records and the use of this material at the prime contractor
level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not EPA's intention to require contractors or their subcontractors to keep records tracking the personal conflicts
individual employees may have, nor is it our intention that prime contractors keep personal conflict of interest
records of their subcontractors. Such records are not necessary to comply with our reporting requirements. EPA's
intent is to minimize any paperwork and administrative burden by having both prime contractors and subcontractors
make their employees aware of the sensitivity and importance of conflict of interest when working on EPA projects
and to place with their employees the responsibility for identifying conflicts. When the contractor is informed
of a personal conflict, it should then report the conflict to EPA. When a personal conflict would arise at the subcontractor
level, the subcontractor would notify the prime contractor of the conflict of interest, along with a description
of actions taken to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict. The prime contractor would in turn notify EPA. If
subcontractor information is sensitive, the prime contractor will consult with the Contracting Officer to determine
a procedure that will allow the prime contractor to fulfill the conditions of the contract and simultaneously providing
protection for the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Ownership of stock and objectivity of individuals. One commenter suggested that without criteria about ownership
of stock or the knowledge about the psychology of individuals, the concept of personal conflict of interest is impossible
to define in practice. We recognize that analysis of conflict situations may be difficult, and there are no objective
criteria that can address every situation that might arise. The critical test that a contractor must use regarding
any potential conflict is whether a conflict exists which would impair the person's objectivity in performing the
work under an EPA contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Limiting disclosure requirements to key project personnel. Some commenters stated that the proposed clause was
too broad and should apply to key personnel and not to personnel, such as clerical or accounting employees, who have
no influence over work on a project. Some commenters connected this requirement to the system of records issue previously
addressed, to demonstrate the prohibitive expense associated with the notification requirement by all personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has carefully considered exempting certain personnel working under an EPA contract from the requirements of
the clause and has decided not to change the clause which extends the notification requirements to all personnel performing
work under an EPA contract. We do not agree that employees below the level of ``key personnel'' do not contribute to
and influence work on EPA projects. One cannot assume that personnel will always perform tasks which are limited to
their generic job categories, and that such employees never have access to sensitive information and never exercise
discretion that may impact work performed for EPA. The final rule simply requires that a contractor inform its employees
about their responsibility to report conflicts of interest. This process is a significantly less burdensome approach
to managing personal conflicts of interest. The development or maintenance of a system of records about a contractor's
employees is not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding
Personnel clause. Therefore, the concern about the expense associated with a system of records is not central to the
issue of which personnel would be subject to the provisions of the clause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Conflict of interest applied to employee level. One commenter stated that it is not clear why EPA is applying conflict
of interest rules at the individual employee level and that the regulation should clarify how the ``objectivity/bias''
rule could be compromised at this level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout this rule, we have emphasized the special nature of Superfund work and the importance of ensuring integrity
of work at sites so that the enforcement actions are not jeopardized. We believe that a contractor employee with a personal
conflict of interest that impaired his objectivity in performing work for EPA could impact Superfund work. Persons
working on our contracts must be able to render impartial assistance so that the integrity of the work product is not
questioned. For example, if a contractor employee performed work for EPA at a site on which the employee had performed
work for a PRP, and the individual was called upon to testify in court to support prior actions taken by the PRP, as well
as to testify to support actions by the EPA, the credibility of the employee's testimony may be questioned. Moreover,
a contractor employee with a conflict of interest stemming from a relationship with a PRP at a site could pose an unacceptable
risk of disclosure of sensitive information that could impact cost recovery strategy or other enforcement action
regarding the site. All we require is that personal conflicts of interest be reported so that we have the opportunity
to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts that may jeopardize our programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Relationships covered by personal conflict of interest clause. One commenter requested a definition concerning
the types of ``relationships'' that might be covered by the personal conflict of interest clause. ``Relationships''
may include personal, financial or business affiliations/connections which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would impair a person's objectivity in performing the contract work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Individual ownership of stock and mutual funds. One commenter pointed out that the term ``relationship'' in this
clause can be interpreted either narrowly or broadly, and asked how EPA views the ownership of stock in an entity or
the owning of shares in a mutual fund which owns stock in the entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since each situation is different and should be examined on a case-by-case basis, it is not appropriate to establish
a position on whether certain ownership of stock in an entity would or would not create a conflict. We would generally
view substantial ownership of stock in an entity as having a higher conflict of interest risk than the more passive
investment in a mutual fund which normally conducts transactions without the active participation of the shareholders.
However, specialized mutual funds may exist which invest in a very narrow group of stocks. Therefore, each situation
should be considered on its own merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Notification to the Project Officer and to the Contracting Officer. One commenter stated that notification to
the EPA Project Officer and to the Contracting Officer is redundant and unnecessary and that notification to the Contracting
Officer should suffice. We have reviewed this recommendation and have decided to retain notification to the Project
Officer. Personal conflicts can have an immediate impact upon work that is performed. Notification directly to the
Project Officer will expedite the EPA response time in avoiding mitigating, or neutralizing such conflicts which
would be beneficial to both the Agency and the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Remedies for non-disclosure. One commenter stated that the rule does not identify what remedies, if any, would
be available to the Government in the event that EPA concludes that a personal conflict of interest was not disclosed
by a contractor. The commenter further stated that appropriate action referenced in the clause could only be termination
for convenience. We disagree. Remedies may include avoidance, mitigation, and neutralization of the conflict as
well as any other remedies which would be permitted under the terms and conditions of the contract.

EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;74, Limitation of Future Contracting
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is added for Superfund contracts to ensure that contractors do not perform work that may conflict with work performed
for EPA and jeopardize Superfund enforcement actions. The clause identifies work which poses a high risk of conflict
of interest and requires contractors to request approval from EPA prior to entering into such contracts. Alternates
are provided that are tailored to specific types of Superfund contracts. The basic Limitation of Future Contracting
(LOFC) clause is for Alternative Remedial Contracting Strategy (ARCS) contracts, and alternates are for Time Critical
Rapid Response (TCRR), Technical Assistance Team (TAT), Environmental Services Assistant Team (ESAT), Technical
Enforcement Support (TES), Headquarters Support, and Site Specific contracts. Depending on the type of EPA work
performed, this limitation may extend for the period of the contract or from three to seven years after completion
of a work assignment. The clause does not prevent contractors from submitting bids/proposals for outside work prior
to receiving Contracting Officer approval. However, the clause provides that any bids/proposals are submitted
at the contractor's own risk and expense. This clause must also be placed in subcontract and consultant agreements
except for specific types of services listed in the clause unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment, including recommendations that the applicability of the LOFC clause and its alternates
be clarified, the following changes have been made:

_The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(3) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses,
has been redesignated as paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering
changes to FAR Subpart 9.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause has also been changed to be consistent with the prescription for the Organizational
Conflict of Interest Clause. The final prescription, paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, includes
a small purchase limitation threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates except Alternative VI, two additional paragraphs have been added
to set forth procedures for an expedited response to an initial LOFC request and for review of an adverse determination.
For Alternative VI, three additional paragraphs have been added to set forth procedures for a request for waiver or
modification of the clause, for an expedited response to an initial future contracting request, and for review of
an LOFC adverse determination. This responds to recommendations that we identify a review process available for
contractors who may question an EPA Contracting Officer's decision on an LOFC request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates, all references to ``zone'' have been changed to ``assigned geographical
area.'' This adds clarity by reflecting the new terminology in the Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC Clause (ARCS) and all alternates, the type of Superfund contract covered by each clause is now added
at the top of each clause. This reduces confusion in reading the text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I has been renamed ``Time Critical Rapid Response'' (TCRR), and we have noted in the clause prescription
that this term includes TCRR, Emergency Response Cleanup Services (ERCS) and other emergency type solicitations
and contracts. This change has been made to clarify the clause's applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In Alternate I (TCRR), Alternate II (TAT) and Alternate V (Headquarters Support), all references to ERCS have been
changed to TCRR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The Field Investigative Team (FIT) Alternate LOFC clause has been removed since such work is to be included in the

_All alternates to this clause have been renumbered to reflect the removal of the FIT Alternate. All further references
will be to the new numbers of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) has been changed to reflect the inclusion of FIT work in ARCS contracts. Since the proposed
rule's FIT LOFC clause is less restrictive than the basic LOFC clause (ARCS), language specifically tailored to FIT
work in ARCS contracts is added to minimize contractor burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (a) has been changed in accordance with comments recommending it be consistent
with paragraph (a) of its alternates, which include ``free to compete for contracts on an equal basis'' language.
All further references will be to the new paragraph (a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs have been relettered to reflect the change in paragraph (a) and the inclusion
of a paragraph addressing FIT work. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are redesignated as paragraphs (b) and (c). The new
FIT paragraph is designated as paragraph (d). Paragraphs previously designated as (b), (c) and (d) have been redesignated
as paragraphs (e), (f), and (g). All further references will be to the new lettering of the final clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates, paragraph (a) language has been changed from ``It is agreed by
the parties to this contract*&blank;*&blank;*'' to ``The parties to this contract agree*&blank;*&blank;*'' This
minor change was made so the LOFC clause language conforms with the use of the active voice in other EPAAR clauses.

_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (c) and (d), parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternates I (TCRR) and II (TAT) and (d)

(1) These paragraphs have been rewritten to emphasize that all that is required is that contractors obtain approval
prior to entering into a contract with respect to the type of work identified. This gives EPA the opportunity to evaluate
such requests on a case-by-case basis and limit its contractors from performing work which would jeopardize work
performed for EPA or ongoing enforcement actions. This change was made in response to public concern that this paragraph
absolutely prohibited the nature of work described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In further response to public comment on these paragraphs, ``other than EPA'' has been added after ``any party''
to clarify that this clause does not cover future work a contractor may enter into for EPA.

_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (c) and (d), and parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternates I (TCRR) and II (TAT) and
(d) of Alternate IV (TES) have also been modified in response to comments questioning the scope of the limitation.
We have clarified that all that is required is reporting of: ``(1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain
to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize
CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under
this contract.'' We are concerned with evaluating future contractor work related to Superfund work performed for
EPA on a site to ensure it does not jeopardize ongoing EPA Superfund work or enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (c), which contains similar language addressing Site Specific contracts,
has also been modified in response to comments questioning its scope. We have clarified that all that is required is
reporting of: ``(1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously
performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain
to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.'' We are concerned with
evaluating future contractor work related to Superfund work performed for EPA on the site covered by its contract
to ensure it does not jeopardize ongoing EPA Superfund work or enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (c) and parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternate II (TAT) and (d) of Alternate IV (TES) have
further been revised. The language ``during the life of the contract'' and ``after completion of the contract'' has
been changed to be consistent with the basic LOFC clause (ARCS), which tracks by tasking document, not by contract.
This change is made in response to commenters' recommendations. It substantially minimizes the burden to contractors
by reducing the time period for which the contractor must request approval for future work.

and ``after the completion of the delivery order or tasking document''. The new language in paragraph (c) of Alternate
II (TAT) is ``during the life of the technical direction document'' and ``after the completion of the technical direction
document''. The language in paragraph (d) of Alternate IV (TES) is now ``during the life of the work assignment'' and
``after completion of the work assignment''.

_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (f) and identical paragraphs (f) of Alternates I (TCRR), II (TAT), IV (TES), VI
(Site Specific), (c) of Alternate III (ESAT) and (e) of Alternate V (Headquarters Support) have been modified. The
language ``agrees not to use it to compete with such companies'' is removed. This change was made to clarify that it
is not EPA's intent to restrict its contractors from using their experience gained in working on EPA contracts from
competing with other companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (d)(3), Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(3), and Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph
(d)(2) have been revised to include ``CERCLA administrative order''. This modification is made in response to public
comment that we cover contracts let prior to final issuance of a CERCLA or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
consent decree or court order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I (TCRR) paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) language describing TAT work is changed from ``Technical Assistance
Team activities (TAT contracts)'' to ``Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts)''.
This change clarifies that this provision applies to TAT type activities and that ``TAT contracts'' is an example
of such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (d)(1) language is also changed from ``Technical Assistance Team activities
(TAT contracts)'' to ``Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts)''. This change clarifies
that this provision applies to TAT type activities and that ``TAT contracts'' is an example of such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In Alternate I (TCRR), paragraph (g), ``treatability studies'' has been added to the flow down exemptions to make
this Alternate clause consistent with all other LOFC clauses in the rule. In addition, because the term ``treatability
studies'' is not routinely used in TCRR contracts, we have noted in the prescription that this term includes ``TCRR
pilot scale studies.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In Alternate IV (TES), we have retained the clause's paragraph (b) language instead of choosing the proposed rule's
option to paragraph (b). This responds to public comment that the initial paragraph (b) is more cost effective and
that implementing the other proposed option would be extremely cumbersome and expensive. In addition, we have added
``during the performance period of this contract'' at the beginning of the paragraph in response to comments requesting
we clarify the period of applicability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_In Alternate V (Headquarters Support), paragraph (c), we have added ``unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting
Officer.'' This change is made in response to public comments expressing concern that there may be circumstances
where the nature of the work under such contracts would not pose a significant conflict for the EPA, and this clause
should not categorically exempt contractors from performing work without examining requests on a case-by-case
basis. We agree that the Contracting Officer shall make conflict of interest determinations on a case-by-case basis
and this change reflects our intent. The objective of this and all of the LOFC clauses is to identify work which we believe
may pose significant risk of conflict of interest and provide EPA the opportunity to avoid conflicts that would damage
the integrity of the Superfund program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Alternate V (Headquarters Support) paragraph (c), FIT and Remedial Engineering Management (REM) contracts are
removed from the list of examples of contracts which include response action work. Although FIT and REM contracts
included response action work, it is no longer appropriate to include them as examples since these contracts are being
phased out of the Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other public comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicability of LOFC clauses to types of work. One commenter requested that the LOFC clauses should be unambiguously
keyed to types of work since the nature of work in different contract types overlap. We disagree. The basic LOFC clause
and each alternate are identified by the Superfund program contract type, i.e., ARCS, TCRR, TAT, ESAT, TES, Headquarters
Support, and Site Specific. These are the standard terms used in the Superfund program to describe types of contracts
by nature of Superfund work. To key the LOFC clauses to other types of work would be confusing, ambiguous and difficult
to track both for contractors and the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Different time periods for LOFC clause and alternates. Several commenters expressed concern that there was no
justification provided for the different time periods and suggested that EPA make the reporting time frames in the
LOFC clauses consistent. Additionally, commenters stated the reporting requirements should either be applicable
after completion of the work assignment or reporting should be limited to the duration of the contract. Still other
commenters suggested the reporting period should be no longer than three years after work assignment completion.
And other commenters stated the reporting requirement after contract completion was overly restrictive if it is
to be applied to any new contracting activity but would be less objectionable if site references were restricted to
only National Priorities List (NPL) sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree reporting requirements for work performed at a site should be limited to a period of time after completion
of the work assignment rather than after contract completion and have made the changes in the appropriate LOFC clauses.
Each LOFC clause has been carefully studied and specifically tailored to fit each program with appropriate time periods
based on the nature of work performed under the contract and the risk of conflict. Because each of the different programs
requiring an LOFC clause has a different role in Superfund cleanup and enforcement, it is necessary for some programs
to have different reporting requirements. The establishment of each time period was made after extensive discussion
of program and enforcement issues. Every attempt was made, however, to be as consistent as possible without jeopardizing
the Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree that reporting requirements should be limited to the duration of the contract or for only three years.
These time limits would not adequately protect the interests of the Superfund program. Because environmental enforcement
cases are averaging seven years from start to completion, it would be very damaging to EPA's enforcement cases if an
EPA contractor could at will perform related work for a PRP at or relating to the same site after it had performed work
for EPA. For example, the TES reporting requirement of seven years is necessary to avoid the potential for compromising
highly sensitive enforcement support information. To reduce this time frame would significantly jeopardize our
ability to enforce CERCLA. Therefore, to prevent such occurrences, it is absolutely necessary for EPA to have procedures
in place which require contractors to request approval before entering into future work with PRPs that could negatively
impact the work performed for EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Limit LOFC clause to NPL sites. Several commenters recommended that the LOFC clause and its alternates apply only
to NPL sites. Some expressed concern whether ``sites'' includes Federal Facilities and requested clarification.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree that the clause should be limited to NPL sites and stress that the rule makes no distinction between private
party sites and Federal Facilities. Restricting the clause's applicability to work on NPL sites would provide insufficient
protection to the Superfund program. The NPL is a priority listing of hazardous waste sites which have been identified
for possible long-term remedial cleanup action under Superfund. Most sites are not placed on the NPL until they have
been formally evaluated and meet a Hazard Ranking System threshold. Contractors perform emergency Superfund work
and pre-remedial work for EPA on many hazardous waste sites that may or may not later be placed on the NPL and also provide
support for enforcement activities at non-NPL sites. It is important to protect such work from conflicts of interest
particularly since we may initiate cost recovery action against PRPs for cleanup work at sites that are not yet on the
NPL and may never be placed on the NPL. Moreover, work an EPA contractor may wish to perform for a private party on a non-NPL
site may directly conflict with work performed for EPA and jeopardize CERCLA enforcement activities. Therefore,
the LOFC clause intentionally makes no distinction between NPL and non-NPL site work in its reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. ``Any party''. Some commenters expressed concern that the term ``any party'' used in the LOFC clause was too broad,
and stated that the term could be interpreted to include another Federal agency. We disagree that the term is too broad
and it is our intent that it include Federal agencies. The rule makes no distinction between private and public sector
work in its reporting requirements. Contractors must report work which is identified as having a high risk of conflict
whether it is for a private party or a Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. ``Jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions''. One commenter recommended that the language in paragraph (c) and
(d) of the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and the parallel language in the Alternates be removed since it is difficult for
contractors to determine whether proposed actions will jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions. We disagree with
this recommendation. The language is included to require contractors to request approval from the EPA Contracting
Officer before entering into a contract for work which may damage our Superfund enforcement actions so that EPA has
the opportunity to protect its enforcement actions from prejudice. When a contractor believes that there is a risk
that work may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions, the contractor shall submit a request to the EPA Contracting
Officer who will make the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Define ``CERCLA activities''. Several commenters requested that we define ``CERCLA activities'' and one commenter
specifically requested that we exempt from the definition activities under Sections 312 and 313 of the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of CERCLA activities is set out in Section 101 of CERCLA. ``CERCLA activities'' includes the terms ``remove
or removal'' the terms ``remedy or remedial action'' and the terms ``respond or response'' as defined in Sections
101 (23), (24) and (25). Activities under Sections 312 and 313 of SARA are by definition excluded from the term ``CERCLA
activities''. Sections 312 and 313 are reporting requirements in SARA Title III, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986'', which is not part of CERCLA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. LOFC and unrelated sites. Commenters stated that the LOFC clauses should not be broadened but should only cover
a site where a contractor previously worked for EPA. One commenter stated that EPA had no authority to deny private
contracting on an unrelated site. Another commenter stated that it would be almost impossible to administer or enforce
the abstract concept of doing CERCLA work for a private client at a given site where work had not been performed before.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first comment refers to the LOFC clause for ARCS and its alternates for TCRR, TAT, TES, and Site Specific contracts.
Each of these clauses contains restrictions pertaining to sites where the contractor previously worked for EPA and
on any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the contractor previously
performed work for the EPA under the contract. This limitation is required because work on related sites could adversely
affect EPA's CERCLA enforcement action at a site where the contractor previously performed work for EPA. The LOFC
alternates for TCRR, TAT and TES contain limitations for geographic areas. These limitations apply only during the
period of performance of the contract. They are included in the TCRR and TAT clauses because these two types of work
cannot be performed by the same contractor in the same geographic area because the risk of a conflict occurring is too
great. In the TES contracts, the geographic limitation on remedial and implementation work is necessary because
of the risk associated with extremely sensitive litigation information, the unauthorized disclosure of which would
jeopardize EPA's enforcement actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second commenter uses the term ``unrelated sites'' in the comment concerning restrictions on private contracting.
We are unclear as to the commenter's definition of this term. EPA's LOFC clause and alternates limit CERCLA work which
pertains to a site, or limit work that may jeopardize enforcement actions which pertain to a site, where the contractor
previously performed work for EPA under the contract. The only other site limitations are those in the TCRR, TAT and
TES Alternates which pertain to sites within the geographic area of the contract. There are no restrictions to sites
outside these limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the commenter that stated that it would be difficult to administer or enforce the limitations that pertain
to the performance of CERCLA work or work which jeopardizes enforcement actions at sites where a contractor has not
performed previous work for EPA. However, EPA's intent in the LOFC clause is not to require excessive administration
but rather to have contractors rely on information of which they are aware at the time they consider entering into a
contract for work at other sites. No extensive searches, certifications, or control systems associated with administration
are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (a) and (b)_Contractors right to compete. One commenter suggested that the
clause include the same ``free to compete on an equal basis'' language in the alternate LOFC clauses. The commenter
further stated that the clauses require clarification that, when a contractor has prepared the statement of work
or other solicitation package for a private party, the restriction of the clause does not apply. Another commenter
requested that the clause be expanded to provide that any contractor that contributes to the development of the statement
of work or the solicitation package should be ineligible to participate in follow-on Superfund remedial action projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the recommendation that the clause be changed to be consistent with its alternates, which include ``free
to compete on an equal basis'' language, and have made this change in the final clause language. We also agree with the
commenter's conclusion that the restriction when a contractor has prepared a statement of work or solicitation package
under the terms and conditions of a Government contract, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor, would not
apply to work performed for private contractors. EPA does not generate statements of work or solicitations for the
use and benefit of a private party. Therefore, no clarification to the clause is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ARCS contracts provide for a contractor's involvement with the complete cleanup of a site from the beginning to
the end, including follow-on remedial action projects. The LOFC clause for the ARCS contracts has been specifically
written to accommodate the special nature of the ARCS program to take advantage of a contractor's expertise and keep
the competitive base as open as possible, especially when EPA has purchased the technology. Therefore, we disagree
with the comment that the clause should be expanded to make any contractors, which participate in the development
of the statement of work or solicitation package, ineligible from participating in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. To make ARCS contractors ineligible would be overly restrictive and disruptive to the Superfund program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (c)_Broaden limitation. One commenter recommended that we broaden this paragraph
to exclude a contractor from working for any party on any contract for the types of work specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. Such a change would be too restrictive to ARCS contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (d)(3)_Applicability of TAT restriction. One commenter recommended that the clause
be clarified to indicate the TAT restriction in the TCRR clause only applies to TAT type contracts offered by the Federal
Government because if it applied to both Government and the private sector it would be overly broad and restrictive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The clause as written clearly requires TCRR contractors to request approval prior to performing TAT
type activities, regardless of whether another Federal agency or a private party issues the contract. A TCRR contractor
is required to provide cleanup services on numerous sites within its respective geographic area and this work often
involves work performed in ``emergency'' situations. It is vital that TCRR contractors be free of conflicts to perform
work for the Agency. Therefore, it is necessary to require TCRR contractors to request approval before performing
any TAT type activities for any other party within its respective geographic area that result from a CERCLA administrative
order, a CERCLA or RCRA consent decree or a court order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(2)_Expand competition restriction. One commenter requested we delete the
language ``Unless an individual design for the site has been prepared by a third party''. The commenter contended
that any knowledge of a site is critical and a contractor having access to a site over a long period of time would be in
a better position to plan and price for unforeseen contingencies. Therefore, this would be patently unfair to other
contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. If the clause were to be modified as suggested, it would have the opposite effect by making the clause overly
restrictive for contractors performing TAT work. Although such a contractor may have gained some knowledge about
a site while working there, it would not necessarily be an unfair competitive advantage when a third party has prepared
the design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(2)_Inability to plan future TAT work. One commenter suggested that this paragraph
not include TAT work that a contractor plans to perform because contractors have no role in determining future TAT
work and TAT work dealing with emergencies cannot be planned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. In many cases, TAT work is planned and advance site information is provided to contractors by EPA. Therefore,
the final clause includes the requirement that a contractor shall not perform remedial construction work on a site
where it has knowledge that it will be performing TAT work for EPA, unless otherwise authorized by the EPA Contracting
Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(3)_Site specific limitations. One commenter suggested the restriction on
TAT contractors be site specific rather than a restriction covering the entire zone. The commenter further stated
that alternate zone contractors should be used if conflicts arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. TAT contracts are established to provide TAT type activities, including TCRR oversight, on potentially
all sites within the geographic area. If contractors perform work for PRPs on sites within the geographic area, and
if EPA were to require oversight on these sites, EPA's ability to plan and promptly commence oversight work would be
significantly impaired. Geographic crossovers are possible in a few unusual circumstances. However, the administrative
cost and additional time associated with this process for a number of sites pose too large a risk to the effective operation
of the TAT program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Alternate III (ESAT)_LOFC applicability to ESAT. One commenter recommended we delete this Alternate since an
LOFC clause is not appropriate for ESAT work. We disagree. This clause contains the limitation on future performance
where the contractor develops the specifications or statement of work under a Superfund contract. This limitation
is common to all Superfund contracts including ESAT.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. Alternate IV (TES) paragraph (b)_Remove or limit restriction. One commenter suggested that the TES LOFC clause
be limited to CERCLA activities by a private party at the NPL sites where work was performed under TES contracts. The
commenter stated that requiring future contracting requests for any work of a remedial nature within the regions
covered by a TES contract is arbitrary and inconsistent with the requirements of actual site work required under other
EPA contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is our intent for paragraph (b) to cover the entire geographic area covered by the contract. The TES clause coverage
is different than the other clauses because of the special sensitivity of TES work which includes support for enforcement
cases. We have seriously considered the recommendation to change this language. However, because of the high sensitivity
of enforcement work, we believe this provision is necessary to best protect the Agency's enforcement and cost recovery
cases. Moreover, because of the sensitivity of all Superfund enforcement work, the clause cannot just be limited
to CERCLA activities at NPL sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Alternate IV (TES) paragraph (d)_Broaden TES LOFC restriction. One commenter recommended TES contractors should
be absolutely prohibited from working for private sector PRPs in order to avoid the potential for compromising enforcement
related data. Although we agree that TES work is highly sensitive, we believe the rule provides adequate measures
to protect EPA's interests. To broaden the LOFC clause would be too restrictive to competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Alternate V (Headquarters Support) paragraph (c)_Response action work. Several commenters expressed concern
about the vagueness of the term ``response action work'' and asked if it had the same meaning as the SARA definition
of ``response action contract''. To clarify the term ``response action work'', we included a number of examples in
the proposed and the final clause. The examples in the final clause include ARCS, TCRR, TAT, and TES contracts. It is
our intention that ``response action work'' have the same definition as ``response action contract'' provided in
CERCLA Section 119, as amended by SARA. However, we have included, in the prescription to this clause, authorization
for the Contracting Officer to modify this paragraph to reflect any unique limitations applicable to the program
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Alternate VI (Site Specific)_Site specific contracts for construction or other non-discretionary work. Some
commenters assumed that this clause would primarily affect construction contractors and recommended that EPA not
apply this clause to site specific contracts which are for construction. Another commenter suggested that work which
a contractor believes is non-discretionary should also be exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. When a solicitation, prime contract or work assignment is issued solely for construction work or for
work that the contractor believes is non-discretionary, the offeror or contractor can request that the LOFC clause
be modified or waived. The Contracting Officer has the authority to approve the request if the work does not pose a high
risk of conflict to the Superfund program. Under Alternate VI, to ensure that prime contractors clearly understand
they have the option of requesting a waiver from or modification of this clause when non-discretionary work is performed,
language has been added to Alternate VI, describing how to obtain a waiver or modification from the Contracting Officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (b)_Site specifications. One commenter suggested that the words ``for
the site'' be inserted in paragraph (b) of the clause so that the clause would only apply to EPA solicitations for the
site. We disagree. Specifications could be developed under a site specific contract which may be included in other
EPA solicitations.

As a result of public comment, the following changes are made to the clause and its prescription: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The proposed annual certification requirement is changed from applying to all Superfund contracts to only contracts
where the contract does not include the submission of other conflict of interest certifications during contract
performance. Superfund contracts requiring annual certification include: Site Specific contracts and the Contract
Laboratory Program (CLP) and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. This change is made in response to comments
that multiple certification requirements are duplicative and overburdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce reporting requirements, the update of conflict of interest plan requirement, which was included in the
proposed rule's clause, EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;78, Annual Certification and Update of Conflict of Interest Plan,
has been deleted. Its prescription has also been removed from the proposed rule's prescription, EPAAR 1510.011&hyph;78,
Annual Certification and Update of Conflict of Interest Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The annual certification requirement in the proposed rule's EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;78 and the prescription EPAAR
1510.011&hyph;78 is designated, under the final rule, as EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;80, Annual Certification, and its
prescription is EPAAR 1510.011&hyph;80, Annual Certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The requirement that contractors certify annually that all personal conflicts of interest have been reported is
changed to ``the Contractor shall certify that it has informed its personnel who perform work under EPA contracts
or relating to EPA contracts of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the
contractors.'' This change was made in response to public comments that it is unfair and overburdensome to require
contractors to certify that personal conflicts have been reported since contractors have to rely on their personnel
to report such conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause has been changed to be consistent with the prescription to the Organizational Conflict
of Interest Clause. The final prescription, EPAAR 1510.011&hyph;80, Annual Certification, includes a small purchase
limitation threshold.

Other comments and our response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Timing of submittal of annual certification. One comment expressed concern that the timing of the annual certification
should be changed to a date certain or tied to a company's fiscal year calendar. We retain the requirement that the annual
certification cover a one year period from time of award, and all subsequent certifications shall cover successive
annual periods thereafter. Such certification must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after
the close of the certification period covered. However, if a contractor has sufficient justification to change the
filing date, the contractor may submit a request to the Contracting Officer who can consider the request for an adjustment
and has the authority to modify the contract accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments and our response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Clarification of conflict of interest plan, evaluation process and confidential data. Some commenters recommended
that we clarify what should be in a conflict of interest plan and the evaluation process and exclude confidential data.
Conflict of interest plans are only required for solicitations in which the Contracting Officer makes a determination
that a significant potential for conflict of interest exists. Any requirements for conflict of interest plans and
information regarding their evaluation will be included in individual solicitations. If any confidential information
is provided, e.g., sensitive corporate structure information, the contractor should mark it accordingly and it
will be safeguarded to the full extent of the law.

EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is amended to add two alternate clauses to be used for all Superfund contracts which do not require annual certifications.
The alternate clauses require contractors to certify within 20 days of receipt of a work assignment that all actual
or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer, or that no actual,
or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist. Where work assignments are issued under a contract for
work related to a site, a contractor is only required to provide a certification for the first work assignment issued
for that site under the contract. In addition, the clauses require a contractor to certify that its personnel who perform
work under this work assignment or relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report
personal and organizational conflicts of interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to public comments the following changes have been made:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The work assignment certification requirement under the proposed rule has been reduced from applying to all Superfund
contracts to only Superfund contracts that are not required to submit annual certifications in accordance with EPAAR
1552.210&hyph;80. This change was made in response to comments that the certification requirements were overly
burdensome and duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The final rule's prescription to the work assignment clause, paragraph (b) of EPAAR 1512.104, Contract clauses,
reflects the reduction in certification requirement by stating that the work assignment certification provision
is not used for contracts which require annual conflict of interest certifications (e.g., Site Specific contracts
and the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The number of work assignment certifications required has also been reduced to minimize contractor burden. Where
contracts include site work, the final clause only requires contractors to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment under the contract issued for that site. For all subsequent work for that site, under
the contract, the contractor has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts but
no additional conflict of interest certifications are required. To reflect this obligation, the certification
includes a statement that the contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any actual
or potential conflict of interest arising during performance of this work assignment or other work related to this
site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The time of work assignment certification has been extended to 20 days after receipt of work assignment. This change
was made in response to comments that five days is insufficient time to search and certify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I affirmatively provides that a contractor must, as a minimum requirement, search through its immediate
past three years of records prior to submitting its certification. Language has been added to the clause to minimize
any misunderstandings about how far back contractors must search. Although contractors are only required to affirmatively
search back through the past three years of records, contractors are always required to report any conflicts of which
they are aware.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The requirement that a contractor certify that all personal conflicts of interest have been reported has been removed.
The final clause requires a contractor to certify only that it has informed its personnel who perform work under this
work assignment or relating to this work assignment of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts
of interest to the contractor. This change was made in response to public comments that it is unfair and too burdensome
to require contractors to certify that personal conflicts have been reported since contractors have to rely on their
personnel to report such conflicts and all that should be required is a good faith effort to obtain such information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed from this clause in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult
to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate II to the Work Assignment clause provides for a transition period for contractors who do not have three
years of records to search. The contractor will be required to search any records that it has, until over time, three
years of records are accumulated. The contractor is still always required to report any conflicts of which it is aware.

EPAAR 1552.227&hyph;76, Project Employee Confidentiality Agreement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is added to ensure that EPA enforcement efforts under the Superfund program are not damaged by contractor employees'
release of information which has either been provided to the contractor by the Government or first generated under
contract. Employees of contractors will be prohibited from release of such information to any parties external to
EPA, the Department of Justice or the contractor without permission of the EPA Contracting Officer. Superfund contractors
will be required to obtain confidentiality agreements from all employees working on requirements under the contract.
The contractor must also include the clause in all subcontracts and consultant agreements unless specifically excluded
under this clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

is redundant because of the mandatory flow down provision; and (2) commenters' mistaken interpretation that the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The language in the prescription to this clause, EPAAR 1527.409 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses,
has been changed to be consistent with prescription for the Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause. The final
prescription includes a small purchase limitation threshold.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Exemption of lower level employees. Some commenters stated that contractors' lower level employees should be
exempted from the requirement that contractors obtain confidentiality agreements from all employees working under
requirements of the EPA contract. We disagree. Because of the sensitivity of Superfund work and the potential for
serious damage to enforcement efforts as a result of unauthorized release of information at any level, we cannot exempt
any employees working under the requirements of the EPA contract. However, it is not our intention to impose an undue
hardship on our contractors. To comply with this clause, it would suffice for contractors to obtain one non-disclosure
agreement from its employees who work on multiple EPA contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Scope of information. One commenter stated that it is unrealistic to limit discussion of information already in
the public domain and one commenter stated that this clause should not preclude disclosure of information routinely
disclosed in the normal course of business. We disagree. This clause's limitation is on data of a sensitive nature
provided by the Government or first generated during contract performance. Such information should not be categorically
authorized for release. However, if a contractor believes such information may be releasable, the contractor may,
on a case-by-case basis, request written permission from the EPA Contracting Officer to disclose such information.
Such requests will be carefully evaluated to ensure adequate protection of sensitive information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Liability for post-employment release of information. One commenter expressed concern that contractors have
no control over employees after their employment and that EPA should make it clear that contractors are not liable
for employees who have left their employment. We agree that contractors should not be held liable for employees breaching
confidentiality agreements after they have left the firm. The intent of this clause is to have contractors obtain
confidentiality agreements from employees to ensure that employees are aware of their obligation not to disclose
sensitive information.

Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is strengthening its existing Organizational Conflict of Interest EPAAR Clause and adding additional coverage
in the EPAAR to guard against conflicts of interest in work performed under Superfund contracts. Prime contractors,
non-exempted subcontractors and consultants working under EPA Superfund contracts will be required to have employees
working on requirements under contract sign confidentiality agreements. Prime contractors will be required to:
notify EPA immediately of any conflicts of interest regarding contractor or subcontractor personnel working on
the EPA contract; submit to EPA either a one time per site certification for work issued under a work assignment or an
annual certification concerning disclosure of conflicts of interest; and seek Contracting Officer approval of
other work when such work might conflict with work performed under an EPA contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Affected small entities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small entities awarded EPA Superfund contracts or small entities serving as subcontractors or consultants under
EPA Superfund contracts will be affected. Presently, approximately 75 small entities are performing such contracts
and subcontracts. It is impossible to estimate the number of small businesses that ultimately will receive EPA Superfund
contracts or serve as subcontractors or consultants under these contracts and, thereby, be affected by this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of projected reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We estimate that businesses generally maintain data on the work previously performed by the company in their normal
business practices which may also be used to prevent conflicts of interest. For entities that maintain this data,
there will be limited additional costs associated with reviewing, evaluating, and reporting work previously performed
and future work being considered that may pose a conflict of interest. EPA does not require any special type of system
to identify and report conflicts. Each contractor determines its own procedures for searching and identifying conflicts
of interest, and in some cases, it may already have a process in place to identify conflicts in its commercial business.
An automated system to store and retrieve information is not required in order to perform the functions associated
with a conflict of interest system. We anticipate that the scope of a company's procedures would be commensurate with
the company's size and complexity, and for small businesses any system should be less complex and detailed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a significant portion of small business participation in EPA programs occurs under subcontracts for classes
of work which are exempt under EPA's conflict of interest clauses, many small businesses will not be affected by the
provisions of this rule. Moreover, at any time, a small business operating as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor
may request waiver of clause requirements for non-discretionary work which poses a minimal risk of conflict of interest.
The total impact upon small business should be significantly less than the impact upon large business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on the specific contract, contractors will either be required to certify annually that all actual or potential
conflicts of interest have been reported to EPA during the preceding year of the contract or certify on a work assignment
basis for work first performed at a site. The significant change to the final rule, in which certifications have been
reduced from three to one, results in a substantial reduction in the total effort required to comply with the requirements
of this rule. Because small businesses generally have less complex organizational structures and less data to maintain
and search, the burden associated with search and certification requirements for small business should be substantially
less than the burden applicable to a large business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that any cost increases experienced by these entities may be chargeable to Government contracts
under the provisions of FAR Part 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to concerns about data and certification burden which have been addressed above, a comment was submitted
expressing concern that responding to the questionnaire, which EPA included in a January 1990, memorandum regarding
conflicts of interest, would add significantly to the contractor burden. As stated in Part B of the preamble to this
rule, General Comments, this memorandum has been superseded, and the questionnaire is not required. Another commenter
expressed concern that the burden associated with requests for future contracting had not been considered in the
calculation of burden. In fact, the burden associated with requests for future contracting was considered in this
analysis and is reflected in the calculations contained in the initial and final Information Collection Request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal rules which may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The EPA reviewed the FAR coverage on organizational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts of interest and rights in data, which this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR requires Contracting Officers to identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest
before contract award and to avoid, neutralize or mitigate significant potential conflicts. This rule fulfills
and is consistent with these requirements. In addition, this rule will address limitations on a firm's other contracting
efforts during contract performance, and in some cases after completion of the work assignment or other similar tasking
document, or after performance of the EPA work contract. The FAR also recognizes that Federal agencies may restrict
a contractor's right to distribute or use data first produced in performance of a contract when necessary in the furtherance
of the agency mission objectives. The rule's requirement for contractor employees working under Superfund contracts
to sign confidentiality agreements restricting release of contract data and other information generally conforms
to these FAR requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also reviewed FAR subpart 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest which deals with conflict
of interest standards for advisory and assistance service contracts and marketing consultants to contractors.
The EPA rule specifically addresses EPA contracts and subcontracts under the Superfund program. Although the FAR
guidance and the EPA rule have the same general objectives of identifying, avoiding mitigating, and neutralizing
conflicts of interest, the EPA provisions include reporting requirements to ensure that conflicts of interest are
reviewed not only prior to contract award, but also during the period of contract performance and after contract performance
to ensure enforcement actions are not jeopardized. It is only in this way that EPA can examine whether a contractor's
work efforts, which may be initiated during the EPA contract performance period or in some cases thereafter, may present
an unacceptable risk to the Agency. This rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other Federal rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternatives to the rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered alternatives to the final rule, such as establishing different compliance or reporting requirements
or simplifying the requirements for small entities. EPA also considered exempting small entities from all or part
of the rule. EPA concluded that the stated objectives cannot be met under such alternatives. An undisclosed conflict
of interest poses the same risk to EPA whether it is a conflict involving a large or small business contractor. EPA believes
the final rule, along with other established internal controls within the Agency, will avoid actual or potential
conflicts of interest that may jeopardize future actions by the Agency.

a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) any work relating to CERCLA activities
which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work
that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed
work for the EPA under this contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the life of this contract, including any options, the Contractor agrees that unless otherwise authorized
by the Contracting Officer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It will not provide any Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts) to EPA on the site
either as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It will be ineligible for award of contracts pertaining to this site which result from a CERCLA administrative
order, a CERCLA or RCRA consent decree or a court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written
approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause,
then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the
Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the request for authorization to enter into the
contract is denied or approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary or confidential business or financial
data of other companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect
such data from unauthorized use and disclosure.

(g) Contractors who are performing nondiscretionary technical or engineering services, including construction
work, may request a waiver from or modification to this clause by submitting a written request to the Contracting Officer.
The Contracting Officer shall make the determination regarding whether to waive or modify the clause on a case-by-case
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts
or consultant agreements for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services, including treatability studies,
well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical services, provisions
which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (h) unless otherwise
authorized by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt
from this clause a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering
services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and
evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.

(i) If the Contractor seeks an expedited decision regarding its initial future contracting request, the Contractor
may submit its request to both the Contracting Officer and the next administrative level within the Contracting Officer's

(j) A review process available to the Contractor when an adverse determination is received shall consist of a request
for reconsideration to the Contracting Officer or a request for review submitted to the next administrative level
within the Contracting Officer's organization. An adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration
by the Contracting Officer will not preclude the Contractor from requesting a review by the next administrative level.
Either a request for review or a request for reconsideration must be submitted to the appropriate level within 30 calendar
days after receipt of the initial adverse determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict
of interest certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for
work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor
has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional
conflict of interest certifications are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the contractor shall search its records accumulated,
at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document.
In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all
actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer or that to
the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist.
In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating
to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of
interest to the Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternate II.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict
of interest certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for
work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor
has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional
conflict of interest certifications are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the contractor shall initially search through all of
its available records to identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the first three years of this
contract, the contractor shall search through all records created since the beginning of the contract plus the records
of the contractor prior to the award of the contract until a minimum of three years of records are accumulated. Once
three years of records have accumulated, prior to certifying, the contractor shall search its records accumulated,
at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document.
In the certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual
or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer or that to the best
of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist. In
addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating
to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of
interest to the Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Contractor recognizes that Contractor employees in performing this contract may have access to data, either
provided by the Government or first generated during contract performance, of a sensitive nature which should not
be released to the public without Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval. Therefore, the Contractor agrees
to obtain confidentiality agreements from all of its employees working on requirements under this contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Such agreements shall contain provisions which stipulate that each employee agrees that the employee will not
disclose, either in whole or in part, to any entity external to EPA, the Department of Justice, or the Contractor, any
information or data (as defined in FAR Section 27.401) provided by the Government or first generated by the Contractor
under this contract, any site-specific cost information, or any enforcement strategy without first obtaining the
written permission of the EPA Contracting Officer. If a contractor, through an employee or otherwise, is subpoenaed
to testify or produce documents, which could result in such disclosure, the Contractor must provide immediate advance
notification to the EPA so that the EPA can authorize such disclosure or have the opportunity to take action to prevent
such disclosure. Such agreements shall be effective for the life of the contract and for a period of five (5) years after
completion of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The EPA may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary
to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to outside entities. If such a disclosure occurs without the
written permission of the EPA Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract, for default or convenience,
or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except
for subcontracts or consultant agreements for well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security
guard services, or electrical services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause,
including this paragraph, unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program have been approved by the
Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520),
and assigned OMB control number 2501&hyph;0013. This interim rule does not contain additional information collection
requirements.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was enacted under title II (42 U.S.C. 12701&hyph;12839) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990). On March 19, 1991, the
Department published a proposed rule (56 FR 11592) to implement the HOME Program. The Department received 119 public
comments in response to the proposed rule. After reviewing and considering these comments, HUD published an interim
rule on December 16, 1991 (56 FR 65313), inviting additional comments on the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received 118 public comments on the interim rule. In partial response to these comments and HUD's experience
in implementing the program, an interim rule to make necessary changes on an expedited basis to the December 16, 1991
interim rule was developed. In addition, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550,
approved October 28, 1992) included a substantial number of amendments to the HOME program. Some of the HCDA 1992 amendments
that were determined to be immediately effective were included in the ``necessary changes'' interim rule, which
was published on December 22, 1992 (57 FR 60960). The remaining HCDA 1992 amendments determined to be immediately
effective were published in an interim rule on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other HCDA 1992 changes were determined to require the publication of a proposed rule with an opportunity for public
notice and comment before they could be implemented. A proposed rule for this purpose was published on April 29, 1993
(58 FR 26048). The Department received 21 comments in response to the proposed rule. Twelve were from state agencies;
four were from local agencies; and five comments were from associations. This rule implements the April 29, 1993 proposed
rule as an interim rule. This rule is being published as an interim rule and not as a final rule because the HOME program
regulation at 24 CFR part 92 has not yet been issued as a final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to implementing the April 29 proposed rule, this interim rule addresses two additional areas of necessary
amendments to the HOME regulation. First, a number of clarifying revisions are made to the HOME regulation to provide
additional guidance for program participants, as explained below in the discussion of changes made to individual
sections. Second, Departmental staff reviewed the HOME rule in relationship to the Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) Program, and developed a number of recommendations for greater compatibility between the HOME and CDBG
regulations which are included in this interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion, arranged according to the sequence of the HOME rule sections being considered, summarizes
and responds to the comments received, and describes the changes made to the HOME Program regulation in this interim
rule. Unless otherwise indicated in this preamble, the portions of this rule that were a part of the proposed rule remain
the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;92.2, the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commitment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is revised. The Department believes greater flexibility in the definition of commitment is required to give participating
jurisdictions additional time to use their HOME allocations. In addition to commitments to specific projects which
are recognized as legally binding agreements between PJs and project owners, the Department is expanding the definition
of commitment. The expanded definition would count as commitments legally binding agreements with State recipients,
subrecipients, contractors or reservation of funds by Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, the Department believed that additional flexibility was warranted for FY1992 funds because of the slow
start-up of the program based on initial statutory complexity. With both significant statutory amendments of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and regulatory simplification by the Department, the ability of States
and local governments to operate the HOME Program has now been increased. Nonetheless, the Department recognizes
that to build upon the momentum of these changes, an expansion of the definition will provide regulatory relief to
allow funds to be committed to both state recipients, subrecipients and CHDOs in a more orderly and equitable fashion.
States can work with small cities and recently formed nonprofits to build capacity without fear of losing funds in
the short term. Local participating jurisdictions may also take on more difficult rental projects with nonprofits
which serve very-low income families or special populations, which often require greater development time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will provide additional guidance on how these commitments will be documented for purposes of meeting
the commitment deadlines. While the Department is providing greater flexibility on commitments, it will continue
to collect information on commitments to specific projects and will maintain its emphasis on this aspect of the program
both in reporting and monitoring of participating jurisdictions. All cash and management procedures will remain
in effect with regard to reporting and disbursement of HOME funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commit to a specific local project, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
included within the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commitment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is revised by changing the start construction period for publicly owned projects from six months to twelve months.
This change will make the start construction period for publicly owned projects consistent with the start construction
period for privately owned projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
community housing development organization 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in &sect;92.2 is revised to specify that this term means a private nonprofit organization that has a tax-exempt ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c) (3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The definition
did not previously include the reference to paragraph (3) or (4) of section 501. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
housing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in &sect;92.2 is revised to include elder cottage housing opportunity (ECHO) units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the ``footprint'' foundation requirements present in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reconstruction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be eased to give participating jurisdictions (PJs) the decision-making ability to waive the requirement
if the situation warrants. The Department agrees that additional flexibility may be needed, for example, to permit
PJs to meet current zoning requirements that would affect the reconstruction site. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reconstruction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &sect;92.2 is modified to permit a unit to be reconstructed anywhere on the existing lot. However, all other Federal
requirements of subpart H would still be applicable to the project.

A new &sect;92.4 is added to implement a Department-wide policy that provides for the expiration of interim rules
within a set period of time if they are not issued in final form before the end of the period. The expiration period may
be extended by notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The expiration date for the HOME interim rule is June 30, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While reconstruction is considered a rehabilitation activity for the general purposes of the HOME Program, this
would not always be the case for complying with the environmental review requirements at &sect;92.352. If a HOME-assisted
project is reconstructed upon the same foundation or footprint as the original structure, it may be treated as a rehabilitation
project for the purposes of complying with part 50 and part 58. However, the reconstruction of a structure on another
portion of the lot must be treated as new construction for purposes of part 50 and part 58. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment of administrative costs as eligible HOME costs is clarified in this rule. The definition of administrative
costs is removed from &sect;92.2 and incorporated into &sect;92.207, a section previously held in reserve, where
administrative and planning costs are listed as eligible costs. The reference to project delivery costs that were
a part of the definition of administrative costs is deleted and a more specific and useful reference is made to staff
and overhead costs directly related to a project. In addition, participating jurisdictions are given the option
of charging such staff and overhead costs as a ``related soft cost'' of a project, under a new &sect;92.206(c)(6),
or as an administrative cost under &sect;92.207. If charged as an administrative cost, these costs are included in
the ten percent cap applicable to administrative and planning costs. If charged to specific projects as related soft
costs, these costs must be prorated among HOME-assisted units, and are subject to the maximum per unit subsidy limits
and matching requirements.

A typographical error in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
single room occupancy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;92.2 is corrected by replacing, in the third sentence of the definition, the word ``residual'' with ``residential.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.50(f) is redesignated as &sect;92.50(d)(5), and its applicability is limited to paragraph 92.50(d)
to conform to the intent expressed in Amendment No. 15 on page 14 of H.Rept. 103&hyph;273, the Conference Report for
the Department's 1994 Fiscal Year appropriations with regard to minimum thresholds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference to ``housing strategy'' is deleted from the title of &sect;92.61, since insular areas are no longer
required to have one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A correction to &sect;92.64(a)(1) (dealing with the applicability of HOME program requirements to insular areas)
is made to delete references to &sect;&sect;92.208 through 92.210, which have been revised since first being cited
in this section, and to the prohibition against using HOME funds to defray administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.150(b)(2) is revised to include the new eligible activities_administrative expenses, and community
housing development organization (CHDO) operating expenses_as required in the program description that participating
jurisdictions must submit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is made to &sect;92.204(a)(1) to remove the reference to &sect;&sect;92.208 through 92.210,
which is no longer relevant because of amendments made to these sections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;92.205(a)(1), the reference to specific eligible costs at the end of the paragraph is revised to include
&sect;&sect;92.206 through 92.209, in accordance with the reorganization of sections dealing with eligible costs,
as described in the following preamble paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The listing of eligible costs is reorganized in this rule. Rather than listing all eligible costs at &sect;92.206,
eligible costs are listed, starting at &sect;92.206 and continuing through previously reserved &sect;&sect;92.207,
92.208, and 92.209, by the type of cost. Thus, &sect;92.206 now covers only eligible project costs; &sect;92.207
covers eligible administrative and planning costs; &sect;92.208 deals with eligible CHDO operating expense costs;
and &sect;92.209 covers eligible costs related to tenant-based rental assistance. Within these sections, clarifying
changes are made as explained below. In addition, conforming changes throughout part 92 to reflect the new section
numbers of eligible costs are made by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(a)(2) is amended to permit the refinancing of secured, existing debt on a single family, owner-occupied
unit when 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
lending
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 program funds to rehabilitate the unit, if overall housing costs of the borrower will be reduced and made more affordable.
This means a PJ can make one loan to the homeowner to repay existing private debt and provide the rehabilitation loan.
HOME funds cannot be used to pay the transaction costs of privately refinancing the existing debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(a)(3) is revised to clarify the eligibility of demolition, utility connections and site improvements
associated with new construction and rehabilitation. This section clarifies that off-site utility connections
from the property line to the adjacent street are eligible. It also provides that site improvements may include on-site
roads and water and sewer lines necessary to the development of the project. The project site is defined as the property,
owned by the project owner, upon which the project is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(c)(5) is clarified by adding the modifier ``project'' before ``operating expenses'' to distinguish
these costs from CHDO operating expenses, which are now covered under &sect;92.208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, a new &sect;92.206(c)(6) makes staff and overhead costs eligible as a ``related soft cost'' of
a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;92.206(c)(7) is added to make the payment of impact fees that are commonly charged for all projects within
a jurisdiction, an eligible cost for new construction and rehabilitation, and the prohibition against impact fees
at &sect;92.214(a)(8) is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(g) is redesignated as &sect;92.208, and a technical correction is made in this section to change the
reference concerning requirements and limitations on the receipt of operating expenses by community housing development
organizations from &sect;92.301 (e) and (f) to &sect;92.300 (e) and (f). Capacity building costs under &sect;92.300(b)
are also specifically listed as eligible HOME costs in &sect;92.208(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request was received for clarification of &sect;92.211(a)(2), amended by the December 22,1992 interim rule to
implement an HCDA 1992 amendment that replaces the use of the Section 8 waiting list as the selection criterion for
families eligible to receive HOME-funded tenant-based rental assistance. This assistance is now provided in accordance
with a participating jurisdiction's written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the
purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules
established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Questions arise because of uncertainty concerning the meaning of ``reasonably related to'' the preference rules
under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These preference rules provide for local rental assistance programs
in which at least 70% of the families assisted meet Federal preferences and 30% meet local preferences. For example,
a Federal preference exists for homeless families. The HOME tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) written selection
policy may provide a preference to families that, although not presently homeless, are likely to be homeless in the
near future. This may be the case for families in transitional housing, which is provided for only a set time period,
or for families living temporarily with relatives or friends. Section 92.211(a)(2) is amended by adding a clarifying
sentence to state that ``reasonably related'' means that the PJs may provide TBRA to families who currently meet a
Federal preference or who because of circumstances would qualify in the near future for one of the three Federal preferences
under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 without tenant-based rental assistance. These preferences are:
(1) Families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless
families); (2) families that are paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent; or (3) families that are involuntarily
displaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received that objected to the requirements at &sect;92.211(f)(3) that limit a PJ's ability to establish
TBRA payment standards based on local market conditions and a determination of rent reasonableness. The Department
agrees that participating jurisdictions should be given greater discretion in the implementation of the HOME program,
and &sect;92.211(f)(3) is amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to several questions concerning eligible acquisition costs, the list of prohibited activities at &sect;92.214
is revised to prohibit the use of HOME funds to acquire property owned by a participating jurisdiction, except for
property acquired by the participating jurisdiction with HOME funds, or property acquired in anticipation of carrying
out a HOME project. Such a transaction could not be considered a bona fide acquisition, since the participating jurisdiction
owns the property and is providing assistance to buy the property. The element of an arm's length transaction is not
present. This prohibition is added as paragraph (a)(8), which previously referred to impact fees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the change (which appeared in the proposed rule) to &sect;92.218(a) to substitute ``housing that qualifies
as affordable housing under the HOME program'' for ``affordable housing assisted with HOME funds,'' &sect;92.218(c)
is revised to give the new citations to the references to eligible costs. A new paragraph (e) is also added to &sect;92.218
to clarify that contributions that have been or will be counted towards satisfying a matching requirement of another
Federal grant or award may not count toward satisfying the matching contribution requirement for the HOME program.
This clarification is based on the language in the Department's common rule on uniform requirements for grants to
State and local governments at 24 CFR 85.24(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight comments opposed the policy outlined in the proposed rule that a PJ's contribution to a state or local tenant-based
rental assistance program is not eligible as match. One comment pointed out some State constitutions prohibit the
use of State funds for the development of private property. These States often have extensive TBRA programs to provide
affordable housing. If TBRA is not allowable for match purposes, then these States would be limited in their ability
to meet their match requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has been convinced by such arguments to permit local contributions to TBRA (but not related administrative
costs) to be used for match. Section 92.219(b) is amended to permit match credit for TBRA which meets the provisions
of &sect;&sect;92.210, 92.211 and 92.253(a) and (b). This parallels the approach taken for local contributions
to affordable housing which is not HOME-assisted, but which must still conform to certain HOME requirements to be
considered ``affordable.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule also provides clarification, made in response to a number of comments that requested additional
guidance, on what HOME requirements apply to projects in which state or local investment of funds are being counted
as match. PJs must establish a procedure to monitor these HOME-eligible projects to ensure continued compliance
with the requirements of 92.203 (income determinations), 92.210 (TBRA-security deposits), 92.211 (TBRA, except
for 92.211(c), Term of rental assistance contract) 92.252 (rental) 92.253 (tenant protections) and 92.254 (ownership),
but the units are not subject to the annual on-site inspections or recertification of income and rents as HOME projects
are. HOME administrative funds may be used to monitor these projects for compliance with HOME requirements. No other
HOME requirements apply, including the cross-cutting requirements of subpart H of part 92, to non-assisted projects
counted as match. Investment in units other than affordable units does not count as match, and &sect;92.219(c) is
amended to reflect this.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, contributions in HOME-eligible projects will be counted in the same manner as match contributions in
HOME-assisted projects. A contribution will be counted only to the extent it is a permanent contribution and repayments
are placed in the HOME local account. Once deposited in the HOME account the funds must be used for HOME-eligible projects;
funds from repayments do not have to be matched but can not count as match. The contribution itself may be for any eligible
forms of match except those in &sect;92.220(a) (2) and (4), which by statute must be made for affordable housing assisted
with HOME funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.220(a)(1) is expanded to clarify that repayments of matching contributions in HOME-assisted projects,
or in affordable housing projects that are not HOME-assisted in accordance with &sect;92.219(b), must be made to
the local HOME account to earn match credit for the full loan amount. In both cases, HOME-assisted and non-HOME-assisted
affordable housing projects, the contribution must be contributed permanently to the project in order to qualify
as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.220(a)(2) is revised and expanded to permit as an eligible form of match contribution all taxes, fees,
and other charges that are imposed or charged on projects and waived by a State or local government. Before this change,
only such charges waived by a participating jurisdiction were eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional guidance on the match eligibility of contributions of land is provided in this rule. The general rule that
the value of land not acquired with federal resources is a permissible form of matching contribution is still applicable.
The reason for excluding land acquired with federal resources is that the authorizing statute for the HOME Program
permits cash contributions only from non-federal resources as an eligible form of match. The ineligibility of federal
resources cannot be circumvented by purchasing land with federal resources (for example, with CDBG funds) and then
contributing the land to a HOME project in order to obtain match credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the question has arisen of whether or not the difference between the fair market value and the purchase price
of land acquired with federal resources and donated to affordable housing would be an eligible form of match. The Department
recognizes that this difference in value could qualify as an eligible contribution, but also recognizes that there
are inherent difficulties in distinguishing between when such a transaction would merely be a ``good buy'' and when
it would constitute a true contribution for match purposes. To provide guidance on this question so that match credit
may be recognized for this form of contribution, &sect;92.220(a)(3) is revised to state that the acquisition cost
in such a transaction must be demonstrably below the appraised value and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation
to affordable housing at the time of acquisition. Property that is acquired with federal assistance must be acquired
specifically for HOME-assisted housing or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to &sect;92.219(b)(2).
If these conditions are met, the full value of the difference in price may be claimed for match credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments disagreed with the prohibition in &sect;92.220(a)(5)(iii) against permitting carryover of excess
match related to bond proceeds to apply to subsequent years' 25 percent limitation. Upon reconsideration, the Department
agrees that such a carryover is appropriate, and this interim rule permits it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;92.221, the provision that defines when bond proceeds are recognized as match, which appeared as paragraph
(b)(6) in the proposed rule, is added as paragraph (a)(7). This is because in the period between the publication of
the proposed rule and this interim rule, an interim rule was published on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130) that revised the
structure of &sect;92.221. In addition, a new paragraph (c) is added to &sect;92.221 to clarify which entity receives
match credit for a contribution. The general rule is that the PJ that makes the match investments in HOME-assisted
or HOME-eligible projects is the entity that receives the match credit. If a non-PJ makes a contribution for affordable
housing to a PJ, the PJ receives the match credit. By way of additional clarification, the interim rule also declares
that a State that makes a contribution to a local participating jurisdiction to be used for affordable housing, whether
or not HOME-assisted, may take the match credit for itself or may permit the local participating jurisdiction to recognize
the match credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven comments were received on the proposed revisions to &sect;92.222 on reduction of the matching contribution
requirement. These comments were generally favorable, especially concerning the two year match reduction period
provision at &sect;92.222(a)(4). A few comments suggested alternative criteria to use for local government participating
jurisdictions, but these criteria are established by statute, and the interim rule merely repeats the statutory
language. There were also suggestions to use other distress criteria, such as changes in non-agricultural employment
or in State taxes collected, for State participating jurisdictions. However, for the reasons stated in the preamble
to the proposed rule, this portion of the interim rule remains unchanged. The list of State participating jurisdictions
that qualify for this match reduction is published as a Notice elsewhere in this issue of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a number of inquiries, this interim rule provides clarification of the adjustment of HOME rents. Section
92.252(a)(1) requires that in order to qualify as affordable housing, a project must bear rents not greater than the
lesser of FMR or 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose gross income equals 65 percent of the median income
for the area. Section 92.252(a)(2) requires further rent limitations on the 20 percent of units in each project which
must be occupied by very low-income families. The adjustment of qualifying rents is addressed in &sect;92.252(d),
which is amended to clarify that the rent ceilings for HOME projects do not fall below the HOME rent for the project in
effect at the time of project commitment. This is permitted to ensure the continued financial viability of the project
and for consistency with the low-income housing tax credit statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.252(a)(2) includes as a rent limitation for the qualification of projects with three or more rental units
as affordable housing that not less than 20 percent of the units be occupied by very low-income families and bear rents
not greater than 30 percent of the gross income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the
area. The Department has received indications that, depending upon the FMR or the differences in adjusted and gross
income, the use of this formula, which is intended to produce a lower HOME rent than that computed under &sect;92.252(a)(1),
results in a higher rent than under &sect;92.252(a)(1). To prevent very low-income families from potentially paying
more rent than low-income families, a new &sect;92.252(a)(2)(iii) is added to specify that the lowest rent computed
under either &sect;&sect;92.252(a) (1) or (2) is applicable to units occupied by very low-income families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A correction is made in this interim rule concerning the foreclosure provisions of &sect;92.252(a)(5) to parallel
the revision made in the June 23, 1993 interim rule to &sect;92.254(a)(4)(i)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A number of clarifying amendments are being made to the homeownership affordability requirements of &sect;92.254(a).
In response to comments criticizing the length of the affordability period imposed upon first-time homebuyers regardless
of the amount of HOME assistance received, this interim rule amends &sect;92.254(a) to make it conform to the &sect;92.252(a)(5)
table that provides differing affordability periods for rental units depending upon the amount of the HOME investment.
The 20-year affordability period for newly constructed housing, regardless of the amount of HOME funds invested,
has been eliminated for homeownership activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional clarifying changes are made to &sect;92.254(a) in this rule. A sentence is added to &sect;92.254(a)(4)(ii)(C)
to specify that the HOME investment subject to recapture is the HOME assistance that enabled the first-time homebuyer
to buy the dwelling unit, including any HOME assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an
affordable price, such as subsidizing construction financing costs or other development costs. The second change
to this section provides guidance with respect to two-to-four unit first-time homebuyer projects. New paragraph
(a)(4)(ii)(D) states that when HOME funds are used in two-to-four unit first-time homebuyer projects, upon recapture
of the HOME funds the affordability periods on the rental units may be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical corrections to change the references to 24 CFR 203.18(b) in &sect;&sect;92.254(a)(1)(i) and 92.254(b)(1)(i)
to 24 CFR 203.18b are made by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six comments were received regarding the ``floating'' units amendment to &sect;92.255, all of them favorable. As
explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department is amending the procedure for housing project owners
to designate those units in a property that are HOME-assisted units. Formerly, specific units were designated as
the HOME units, and that designation was fixed for the term of the affordability period. To provide more program flexibility,
this interim rule adds new language to &sect;92.255 that permits the participating jurisdiction to use a system of
``floating'' units that may be changed over the affordability period, so long as the total number of units remains
the same and the substituted units are at least comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms to the
originally designated HOME-assisted units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional guidance is provided in &sect;92.256 by clarifying that the requirement that residential living space
must constitute at least 51 percent of the project space is significant only for purposes of counting the contribution
in the non-residential portion of the property as match. The concern in making this change is that this section was
being misinterpreted to mean that a project required at least 51 percent residential living space to permit the use
of HOME funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ECHO housing provisions of &sect;&sect;92.259 and 92.625 were addressed in two comments that were generally
favorable. One of the comments pointed out differences in the two sections and recommended that they be made uniform.
The two sections are, in fact, identical except for the differences necessary to accommodate the general HOME program
and the program as modified for Indian tribes in subpart M of the rule.

In &sect;92.300(b), the language concerning the availability of a percentage of the minimum CHDO setaside for capacity
building is amended from ``may be expended'' to ``may be committed'' to allow participating jurisdictions more flexibility
in using HOME funds for this purpose. Corrections are made to change the references in &sect;&sect;92.300 (e) and
(f) from operating expenses provided under &sect;92.206(g) to operating expenses provided under &sect;92.208,
and to change the reference in &sect;92.300(f) from administrative funds under &sect;92.206(f) to administrative
funds under &sect;92.207, to conform these citations to this rule's reorganization of eligible costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.354(a) is revised to clarify the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to the HOME Program. The revision
makes clear that the Davis-Bacon wage provisions apply if HOME funds are used for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 project costs (as defined at &sect;92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12
or more assisted units. Once applicable, these wage provisions apply to all laborers and mechanics employed in the
development of the entire project, as defined in &sect;92.2, including portions other than the assisted units. The
interim rule specifies that if HOME funds are only used to assist first-time homebuyers to acquire single-family
housing and not for any other project costs, these wage provisions apply to the construction of housing containing
12 or more units when there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that the HOME funds will
be used to assist first-time homebuyers to buy the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is made to &sect;92.502(b)(1) that is necessary because of the amendment made to the definition
of commitment in &sect;92.2, discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule eases the requirements of &sect;92.504(e)(1) by permitting on-site review once within a two-year
period for rental housing containing 25 HOME-assisted units or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in &sect;92.508, paragraph (a)(4)(v) is revised to make a conforming change, related to the reorganization
of eligible costs, from a reference to &sect;92.206(g) to a reference to &sect;92.208.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because jurisdictions
that are statutorily eligible to receive formula allocations are relatively larger cities, counties or States.

This interim rule was listed as item number 1472 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on

Federalism Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,
Federalism, that this interim rule does not have federalism implications concerning the division of local, State,
and federal responsibilities. While the HOME Program interim rule amended by this interim rule was determined to
be a rule with federalism implications and the Department submitted a Federalism Assessment concerning the interim
rule to OMB, this amending rule only makes limited adjustments to the interim rule and does not significantly affect
any of the factors considered in the Federalism Assessment for the interim rule.

Impact on the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
interim rule would not have significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Assistance
provided under this interim rule can be expected to support family values, by helping families achieve security and
independence; by enabling them to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and by giving them the means to live independently
in mainstream American society. This interim rule would not, however, affect the institution of the family, which
is requisite to coverage by the Order. Even if this interim rule had the necessary family impact, it would not be subject
to further review under the Order, since the provision of assistance under this interim rule is required by statute,
and is not subject to agency discretion.

(2) The participating jurisdiction selects families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria
that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably
related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 70% of the families assisted
qualify, or would qualify in the near future without the tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal
preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing
(including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more
than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating
jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation
or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written
tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitated
or acquired unit or in other qualified housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Local market conditions; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) May not be less, for each unit size, than 80 percent of the published Section 8 Existing Housing fair market rent
(in effect when the payment standard amount is adopted) nor more than the fair market rent or HUD-approved community-wide
exception rent (in effect when the participating jurisdiction adopts its rent standard amount). (Community-wide
exception rents are maximum gross rents approved by HUD for the Rental Certificate Program under 882.106(a)(3) of
this title for a designated municipality, county, or similar locality, which apply to the whole PHA jurisdiction.)
A participating jurisdiction may approve on a unit-by-unit basis a subsidy based on a rent standard that exceeds the
applicable fair market rent by up to 10 percent for 20 percent of units assisted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It is made with respect to a tenant who is assisted with HOME funds; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is made with respect to HOME-assisted housing; or

except for 92.211(c), term of rental assistance contract), and 92.253(a) and (b) (tenant protections); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The participating jurisdiction must demonstrate in writing that such assistance meets the provisions of &sect;&sect;92.203,
92.210, 92.211, and 92.253(a) and (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For affordable housing projects that are not HOME-assisted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The contribution must be made with respect to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under &sect;92.252
or &sect;92.254. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The participating jurisdiction or its instrumentality must execute, with the owner of the housing (or, if the
participating jurisdiction is the owner, with the manager or developer), a written agreement that imposes and enumerates
all of the affordability requirements from &sect;92.252 and &sect;92.253(a) and (b) (tenant protections), or &sect;92.254,
whichever are applicable, the property standards requirements of &sect;92.251, and income determinations made
in accordance with &sect;92.203. This written agreement must be executed before any match contributions may be made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A participating jurisdiction must establish a procedure to monitor these HOME match-eligible projects to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a cash contribution is recognized as
a matching contribution only if it is used for costs eligible under &sect;&sect;92.206 or 92.209, or for the following
costs (which are not eligible costs for HOME funds): The cost of removing and relocating an ECHO housing unit to accommodate
an eligible tenant, a project reserve account for replacements, a project reserve account for unanticipated increases
in operating costs, operating subsidies, or costs relating to the portion of a mixed-income or mixed-use HOME-assisted
project not related to the affordable housing units.

Except for contributions made to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds and bond proceeds to which
the provisions of &sect;92.220(a)(5) are applicable, to be a cash contribution, funds must be contributed permanently
to the HOME program, regardless of the form of investment the jurisdiction provides to a project. Therefore all repayment,
interest, or other return on investment of the contribution must be deposited in the local account of the participating
jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to be used for eligible HOME activities in accordance with the requirements
of this part. A cash contribution to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds must be contributed permanently
to the project. Repayments of matching contributions in affordable housing projects, as defined in &sect;92.219(b),
that are not HOME-assisted, must be made to the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment
Trust Fund to get match credit for the full loan amount.

(2) The value, based on customary and reasonable means for establishing value, of State or local taxes, fees, or other
charges that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by a State or local government on all transactions or
projects in the conduct of State or local government operations but are waived, foregone, or deferred (including
State low-income housing tax credits) in a manner that achieves affordability of housing assisted with HOME funds.
Fees or charges that are associated with the HOME Program only (rather than normally and customarily imposed or charged
on all transactions or projects) are not eligible forms of matching contributions. The amount of any real estate taxes
may be based on post-improvement property value, using customary and reasonable means of establishing value. For
taxes, fees, or charges that are given for future years, the value is the present discounted cash value, based on a rate
equal to the rate for the Treasury security with a maturity closest to the number of years for which the taxes, fees,
or charges are waived, foregone, or deferred.

(i) Property not acquired with federal resources is a contribution in the amount of 100% of the value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Property that is acquired with federal assistance must be acquired specifically for HOME-assisted housing
or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;92.219(b)(2). Such property is a contribution in the amount of the difference between the acquisition cost
and the appraised value at the time of acquisition with the federal assistance, provided that the property is acquired
by the HOME project owner (or owner of the affordable housing that will be counted as match) with the federal assistance.
It also may be given to the HOME project owner (or owner of the affordable housing that will be counted as match) by the
entity acquiring the property with federal assistance or sold to the HOME project owner (or owner of the affordable
housing that will be counted as match) at a price equal to or less than the amount of the federal assistance used to acquire
the property. The acquisition cost paid with the federal assistance must be demonstrably below the appraised value
and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation to affordable housing at the time of the acquisition with the federal
assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Property must be appraised in conformance with established and generally recognized appraisal practice and
procedures in common use by professional appraisers. Opinions of value must be based on the best available data properly
analyzed and interpreted. The appraisal of land and structures must be performed by an independent, certified appraiser.

State or local government, or an agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of a State, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fifty percent of the loan amount made from bond proceeds to a multi-family affordable housing project owner may
qualify as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Twenty-five percent of the loan amount from bond proceeds made to a single-family affordable housing project
owner may qualify as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Loans made from bond proceeds may not constitute more than 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total
annual match contribution. Loans made from bond proceeds in excess of 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's
total annual match contribution may be carried over to subsequent fiscal years as excess match, but may not constitute
more than 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total annual match contribution in any one year.

(c) The participating jurisdiction that makes the match contributions to HOME-assisted or HOME match eligible projects
(match pursuant to &sect;92.219(b) for contributions to affordable housing, including tenant-based rental assistance,
that is not assisted with HOME funds) is the participating jurisdiction that receives the match credit. A State that
provides funding to a local participating jurisdiction to be used for a contribution to affordable housing, whether
or not HOME-assisted, may take the match credit for itself or may permit the local participating jurisdiction to receive
the match credit.

 (1) Changes in fair market rents and in median income over time should be sufficient to maintain the financial viability
of a project within the qualifying rent standards in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. Regardless of changes
in fair market rents and in median income over time, the qualifying rents are not required to be lower than the HOME rent
for the project in effect at the time of project commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HUD may adjust the qualifying rents established for a project under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section,
only if HUD finds that an adjustment is necessary to support the continued financial viability of the project and only
by an amount that HUD determines is necessary to maintain continued financial viability of the project. HUD expects
that this authority will be used sparingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Housing in a project that is designed in part for uses other than residential use qualifies as affordable housing if
such housing meets the criteria of &sect;92.252 or &sect;92.254. A project that contains, in addition to dwelling
units, laundry and community facilities for the exclusive use of the project residents and their guests, does not
constitute a project that is designed in part for uses other than residential use. Residential living space must constitute
at least 51 percent of the project space for contributions to the non-residential portion of the property to count
as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. In subpart F, a new &sect;92.259 would be added to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of &sect;92.252 of this part apply to HOME-assisted ECHO units, except as specified in this section,
including the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only one ECHO unit may be provided per host property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The ECHO unit owner may choose whether or not to charge the tenant of the ECHO unit for rent, but if a rent is charged,
it must meet the requirements of &sect;92.252. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ECHO housing must remain affordable for the period specified in &sect;92.252(a)(5). If within the affordability
period the original occupant no longer occupies the unit, the ECHO unit owner must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Rent the unit to another eligible occupant on site; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Move the ECHO unit to another site for occupancy by an eligible occupant; or

* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Each participating jurisdiction must make reasonable efforts to identify community housing development organizations
that are capable, or can reasonably be expected to become capable, of carrying out elements of the jurisdiction's
approved housing strategy and to encourage such community housing development organizations to do so. If during
the first 24 months of its participation in the HOME Program a participating jurisdiction cannot identify a sufficient
number of capable CHDOs, up to 20 percent of the minimum CHDO setaside of 15 percent specified in paragraph (a) of this
section (but not more than $150,000 during the 24 month period) may be committed to develop the capacity of CHDOs in
the jurisdiction.

(e) If funds for operating expenses are provided under &sect;92.208 to a community housing development organization
that is not also receiving funds under paragraph (a) of this section for housing to be developed, sponsored or owned
by the community housing development organization, the participating jurisdiction must enter into a written agreement
with the community housing development organization that provides that the community housing development organization
is expected to receive funds under paragraph (a) of this section within 24 months of receiving the funds for operating
expenses, and specifies the terms and conditions upon which this expectation is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A community housing development organization may not receive HOME funding for any fiscal year in an amount that provides
more than 50 percent or $50,000, whichever is greater, of the community housing development organization's total
operating expenses in that fiscal year. This includes organization support and housing education provided under
&sect;92.302 (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6), as well as funds for operating expenses provided under &sect;92.208 and
administrative funds provided under &sect;92.207 (if the community housing development organization is a subrecipient
or contractor of the participating jurisdiction). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. In &sect;92.354, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Every contract for the construction (rehabilitation or new construction) of housing that includes 12 or more
units assisted with HOME funds must contain a provision requiring the payment of not less than the wages prevailing
in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a&hyph;276a&hyph;5),
to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of any part of the housing. Such contracts must also be subject
to the overtime provisions, as applicable, of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327&hyph;332).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs (as
defined in &sect;92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted
units. Where 12 or more units in a project are assisted under this part, the wage provisions must be contained in the
construction contract so as to apply to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project,
as defined in &sect;92.2, including portions other than the assisted units. If HOME funds are only used to assist first-time
homebuyers to acquire single-family housing and not for any other project costs, the wage provisions apply to the
construction of housing containing 12 or more units when there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of
the housing that the HOME funds will be used to assist first-time homebuyers to buy the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Participating jurisdictions, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations
issued under these Acts and with other federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards and HUD Handbook
1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs), as applicable. Participating
jurisdictions must require certification as to compliance with the provisions of this section before making any
payment under such contract.

(1) After the participating jurisdiction executes the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, complies with the
environmental requirements under part 58 of this title for release of funds, and submits the appropriate banking
and security documents, the participating jurisdiction may identify (set up) specific investments in the C/MI System.
Investments that require the set-up of projects in the C/MI System are the acquisition, new construction, or moderate
or substantial rehabilitation of real property, and investments of HOME funds to provide tenant-based rental assistance.
Within 12 calendar days of project set-up, the participating jurisdiction is required to submit a Project Set-Up
Report to HUD for each project set up in the C/MI System. Until an acceptable Project Set-Up Report is received and entered
in the C/MI System, HOME funds for the project are not considered committed to a specific project (as defined in &sect;92.2).

(1) Not less than annually, the participating jurisdiction must review the activities of owners of rental housing
assisted with HOME funds to assess compliance with the requirements of this part, as forth in the written agreement
under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For multi-family housing, each review must include on-site inspection
to determine compliance with housing codes and the requirements of this part. For rental projects containing 25 HOME-assisted
units or less, an on-site review must be made once within each two year period. The results of each review must be included
in the participating jurisdiction's performance report required by part 91 of this title and must be made available
to the public.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is issuing regulations to require that all manned, oceangoing U.S. vessels 12.2 meters (approximately
40 feet) or more in length engaged in commerce and all manned fixed or floating platforms subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States keep records of garbage discharges and disposals. Regulations specifying the vessels and platforms
required to maintain these records are mandated by statute. The use of shipboard garbage discharge and disposal records
will promote compliance, facilitate enforcement, and reduce the amount of plastics discharged into the marine environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 20, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Recordkeeping of Refuse Discharges
From Ships'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 29482). The Coast Guard received 23 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These statutory provisions had been addressed previously in a Coast Guard notice of proposed rulemaking (54 FR 37084;
September 6, 1989) but the regulatory section, as proposed, failed to receive OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction
Act and was deleted from the interim rule published on May 2, 1990 (55 FR 18578).

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 (the Act) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;220) implements Annex V
of MARPOL 73/78. Section 2107 of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1903 (b)(2)(A)) requires that the Secretary of the Department in
which the Coast Guard is operating prescribe regulations which (a) require certain U.S. ``ships'' (defined in the
Act to include fixed or floating platforms, as well as vessels) to maintain refuse record books and (b) specify the
ships to which the regulations apply. Refuse record books will be used to document waste discharges from the ships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite implementation of other Coast Guard Annex V regulations to date, large amounts of plastic continue to wash
ashore, obstruct navigation, and entangle marine life. Very likely, much of this plastic was illegally discharged
as garbage from ships. According to the Coast Guard's ``MARPOL Reception Facility Study,'' an informal survey of
all Annex V reception facilities on the East and Gulf coasts, less than 20 percent of the vessels calling at these ports
off-load garbage at a reception facility. Yet, Coast Guard boarding officers frequently find no trace of garbage,
separated plastics, or incinerated ash on ships that doubtlessly generate large quantities of garbage, such as vessels
on long voyages. The evidence strongly suggests that, despite current regulations, large amounts of garbage are
still being discharged overboard before plastics are separated out for later disposal ashore or incineration aboard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though no regulation can stop a crew member intent on violating the regulation from illegally discharging garbage,
certain measures can be taken to reduce the number of intentional, as well as negligent, illegal discharges. Under
33 CFR 151.63(a), the master or person in charge of a ``ship'' is made personally responsible for all discharge or disposal
operations. Therefore, a requirement for the master or person in charge to maintain detailed records of each disposal
operation will promote knowledge of the discharge regulations and awareness of waste handling practices on the ship,
and provide a means of verifying that masters and persons in charge are carrying out their responsibilities. These
records will provide a more complete and accurate source of information for boarding officers than would the recollections,
over the duration of a voyage, of the master or person in charge. The Coast Guard has already identified the benefits
of records by stating in 33 CFR 151.63(b)(2) that log entries indicating discharge operations may be considered by
enforcement personnel in evaluating compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Coast Guard's ``MARPOL Reception Facility Study'' states that refuse recordkeeping is critical
to strengthening enforcement efforts. It is clear that the previous regulations have failed to curtail the growing
pollution problem. The waste management plans required by 33 CFR 151.57, which, it was hoped, would satisfy the statutory
mandate for a refuse record book, have in and of themselves produced inadequate results. It is now believed that, in
conjunction with waste management plans, refuse recordkeeping will measurably improve the management of refuse
aboard ships. In addition, it will provide data for evaluating this regulatory program and its effect on the environment.
Coast Guard boarding officers are noting with continued frequency that foreign vessels are maintaining refuse records
in order to demonstrate that they follow proper discharge procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this rulemaking, the Coast Guard is pursuing adoption of an international requirement for refuse recordkeeping
through the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In this regard, the Coast Guard submitted an action paper
at IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting in July 1993.

Discussion of Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Three comments were in favor of the regulations. Of these three, one saw no problems with the rule and the other two
encouraged vigorous enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard intends to vigorously enforce these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment stated that the rule would have no effect on the discharge of garbage in the marine environment since
those who illegally dump would merely falsify records and continue the practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recording of waste disposal will aid in enforcement by identifying those ships that do not appear to have policies
and disposal methods that support the records they provide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment suggested that methods other than recordkeeping be used to reduce the amount of garbage in the marine
environment. Specifically, they proposed that plastic packaging materials be banned and replaced with biodegradable
materials, that ship operators be required to provide garbage handling personnel, and that on board waste processing
equipment be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These ideas may have merit and deserve future consideration. However, they are outside of the scope of this rulemaking,
which is limited to implementing 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) One comment stated that this recordkeeping should be required on the international level to avoid duplicative
national laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though this idea may have merit, it is outside of the scope of this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Applicability (Section 151.55(a))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Coast Guard is in the process of converting measurements in many of its regulations to the metric system. Therefore,
&sect;151.55(a)(1) has been changed to refer to vessels of ``12.2 meters (approximately 40 feet).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Eleven comments were received from representatives of the offshore oil and gas industry indicating that regulations
on discharges already exist for fixed and floating platforms and that this additional requirement would be unnecessary
and redundant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Offshore platforms are made subject to the recordkeeping requirement in 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A)(i) because platforms
are included in the term ``ship'' as used in that provision. However, this rulemaking should have little effect on
platform operators as all discharges, except for ground victual waste beyond 12 nautical miles, are prohibited already
under 33 CFR 151.73.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment suggested that vessels or platforms discharging garbage to offshore supply vessels (OSV's) be required
to provide the OSV with records indicating the generator and amount of waste so that the OSV can make an accurate record
of waste it discharges ashore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The records required by this rule are for establishing compliance and maintaining a statistical record of garbage
discharged at sea. This will be done by inspections on the ships in question. Therefore, there is no justification
to put an additional burden on vessels and platforms by requiring them to provide OSV's with garbage records. Furthermore,
an OSV is not required under this rule to keep records of garbage it takes as cargo from another vessel or platform. The
word ``garbage'', as used throughout part 151, is defined in 33 CFR 151.05 as waste generated during the normal operation
of the ship. Garbage taken from a vessel or platform for shipment ashore is considered cargo on the OSV and is regulated
by the Shore Protection Act of 1988 (33 U.S.C. 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). It can not be mixed with the OSV's ship-generated garbage and disposed of at sea.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) One comment from an association representing a large segment of the passenger vessel industry recommended that
passenger vessels certificated for ocean service, though engaged exclusively in inland trade, not be required to
maintain refuse records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these vessels usually discharge at shore reception facilities, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for
enforcement officials to determine that these vessels never operate outside of inland waters. However, &sect;151.55(c)(6)
has been changed to exclude garbage discharged to shore reception facilities from the requirement that garbage be
described by category. Shore discharges do not have the limitations as to contents as to discharges at sea. This change
significantly reduces the reporting burden for passenger, as well as other, vessels that discharge to shore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) One comment from a representative of the coastal towing industry stated that their vessels rarely operate outside
of 20 miles, have small crews, and are able to retain their garbage on board for shore disposal. Therefore, they should
be exempt from the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The capability of retaining garbage on board for disposal ashore is not sufficient justification to be exempted from
this rule. However, as with other vessels, if towing vessels retain their garbage on board for disposal to a shore reception
facility, they would be exempt from the requirements that they categorize their garbage under &sect;151.55(d)(6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Two comments stated that foreign ships were a major contributor to debris in the marine environment and should
be included in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are limited by 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A) to ships of United States registry or nationality or operated
under the authority of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) One comment stated that recreational vessels were a major cause of garbage in the marine environment and should
be included in this requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule, the majority of recreational vessels do not operate outside of the
inland or coastal waters of the United States. They usually are engaged in voyages of short duration and do not generate
large amounts of garbage. Recreational vessels have a greater ability to retain garbage on board until returning
to port, where they usually have access to trash receptacles at the marina. Additionally, there is no requirement
for recreational vessels to maintain a log of any kind, making recordkeeping a greater burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) One comment stated that there is no evidence that vessels are the problem and that the major cause of garbage in the
water is sewage outflows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An increasing number of Coast Guard pollution cases clearly document a pattern of illegal garbage discharges from
vessels. This is confirmed each year by the beach cleanups conducted under the guidance of the Center for Marine Conservation.
While sewage outflows may be a significant cause of garbage in the marine environment, regulation of these outflows
is outside of the scope of this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) One comment stated that public vessels are a major cause of garbage in the water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public vessels were not required to be in compliance with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of
1987 until December 31, 1993. Guidance has been, or will be, developed by the agencies responsible for these vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) One comment questioned why this rule applies to vessels of 40 feet or more, where the 1989 proposal applied to vessels
of 79 feet or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard lowered the size requirement in order to include classes of vessels that have been identified as possible
polluters in a study conducted by the Coast Guard and submitted to Congress on the implementation of MARPOL, Annex
V. This study, entitled ``Compliance with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987'', was required
by that Act. There is further discussion of the 40 foot threshold in the preamble to the May 20, 1993, notice of proposed
rulemaking (58 FR 29483).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Information on Discharge or Disposal Operations (Section 151.55(c))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The MARPOL protocols request that the quantity of garbage disposed of at a shore reception facility be recorded
in cubic meters. Therefore, &sect;151.55(c)(5) has been changed to this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment stated that the requirement to log the distance to shore in addition to recording the latitude and longitude
was unnecessary. The comment stated that many vessels do not routinely keep track of the vessels's distance from shore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions in &sect;&sect;151.51 through 151.77 that specify where each type of garbage can be discharged are
based on the distance of the vessel from shore. Effective enforcement depends on knowing how far from shore a particular
type of garbage was discharged. However, recognizing that calculating the precise distance from shore using the
latitude and longitude is burdensome, the Coast Guard has changed &sect;151.55(c)(4) to allow the distance from
shore to be estimated. This alleviates the need for a specific calculation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) One comment recommended that the number of categories for recording of the contents of garbage be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Categories are necessary because the discharge regulations in &sect;&sect;151.51 through 151.77 are based on garbage
contents. However, upon review of the various regulations, it was determined that none of the regulations applicable
to vessels made a distinction between ground and unground victual waste. [Section 151.73 for platforms refers to
ground victual wastes, but this is the only category allowed to be discharged from a platform.] Therefore, &sect;151.55(c)(6)
has been changed to combine ground and unground victual waste into a single category. The word ``victual'' replaces
``food'', as used in the proposed rule, because it is a defined word used throughout part 151. [See &sect;151.05.]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment stated that a single book should be developed to record the discharge of oil, noxious liquid substances,
and garbage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule allows ship operators to use such a book at their option. To require such a book is unnecessarily restrictive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Cost to Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) One comment stated that the estimate used in the draft Regulatory Evaluation of two minutes to sort garbage and
record its disposal was too short a time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two minute estimate was intended only to cover the recording of the disposal of garbage, not the sorting as well.
The sorting of garbage for disposal is an action that already must be undertaken to comply with the discharge restrictions
of &sect;&sect;151.51 through 151.77, regardless of whether or not a ship is required to record that disposal. Sorting
was not considered when determining the two minute estimate. Nevertheless, the Coast Guard has reevaluated the time
necessary to determine and record the amount and type of garbage being discharged and has found that five minutes per
entry is a more reasonable estimate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment was received from an association representing the towing industry stating that the Coast Guard's
estimate of the number of coastal towing boats that would be subject to this rule was incorrect. Rather than the number
23, as used in the draft Regulatory Evaluation, they stated that the correct number was closer to 350.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Evaluation has been changed accordingly. In preparing the draft Regulatory Evaluation, the wrong
number was inadvertently transposed and misstated. The Coast Guard agrees with the number provided by the comment.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It is not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A final Regulatory Evaluation
has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following is a summary of the Evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total annual projected cost to industry of requiring that refuse records be maintained is estimated to be $12,370,915.54.
The increase in this total, as compared to that in the draft Regulatory Evaluation, is due to the increase in the estimated
recording time from two to five minutes. The total annual projected cost does not reflect the potential reduction
in reporting time for ships discharging at shore facilities or incinerating on board. In the final rule, ship operators
who discharge on shore or who incinerate on board no longer need to categorize the contents of their garbage. Nor does
the projected cost reflect the potential reduction in reporting time resulting from the deletion of the requirement
that the ship's distance from shore be precisely calculated. In the final rule, the distance may be estimated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard based the implementation costs of these regulations on the following categories of U.S. ships: freight
and tank vessels, tug and tow vessels, small fishing vessels (less than 300 gross tons), large fishing vessels (300
gross tons or more), passenger vessels, cruise vessels, vessels engaged in offshore oil and gas operations, research
and other miscellaneous classes of vessels, and manned fixed and floating platforms. The annual cost for a ship to
comply with these regulations was calculated by multiplying the time it would take to complete a refuse record entry
(five minutes), by the number of discharges per day (one), by the average wage per minute of the deck officer, chief
steward, or operator aboard each category of ship, and by the average number of discharges per year for each category
of ship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual cost per ship in each category is estimated to be: freight or tank vessel: $2,145.79; tug or tow vessel: $804.67;
small fishing vessel: $468.48; large fishing vessel: $585.21; passenger vessel: $804.67; cruise vessel: $6,437.37;
offshore oil or mineral vessel: $890.01; research or other miscellaneous class of vessel: $420.62; and manned fixed
or floating platform: $128.01.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated numbers of vessels affected in each category are: 586 freight and tank vessels, 350 tug and tow vessels,
16,948 small fishing vessels, 224 large fishing vessels, 2,870 passenger vessels, 4 cruise vessels, 276 offshore
oil and mineral vessels, 124 research and other miscellaneous classes of vessels, and 1,000 manned fixed and floating
platforms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total annual cost for each category of ship was calculated by multiplying annual cost per ship by the estimated
number of ships effected in each category: freight and tank vessels: $1,257,432.94; tug and tow vessels: $281,634.50;
small fishing vessels: $7,939,799.04; large fishing vessels: $131,087.04; passenger vessels: $2,309,402.90;
cruise vessels: $25,749.48; offshore oil and mineral vessels: $245,642.76; research and other miscellaneous classes
of vessels: $52,156.88; and manned fixed and floating platforms: $128,010.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average annual burden of this requirement per respondent is estimated to be 20.9 hours. This average was calculated
by dividing the total number of hours spent on recordkeeping annually, by the total number of applicable ships.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard does not have accurate information on how many vessels or manned fixed or floating platforms would
qualify as small entities and what the economic impact on them would be. However, because the recordkeeping is expected
to require only five minutes per day and no particular record book or format is prescribed, the Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains a collection of information requirement. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

), and OMB has approved them. The section number is &sect;151.55 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control
Number 2115&hyph;0613.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The regulations
are administrative in nature and are expected to have some positive but no negative impact on the environment. The
regulations should contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of plastic, as well as other ship-generated garbage,
in the marine environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying
where indicated under
