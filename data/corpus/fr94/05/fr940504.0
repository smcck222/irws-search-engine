 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its farm tract appraisal regulations in order to implement and conform
to the provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989. The intended
effect of this rule is to meet the provisions of title XI of FIRREA and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practice (USPAP) as directed from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Bulletin A&hyph;129).

We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: (1)
Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an
action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations or recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Discussion of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 25, 1993, FmHA published an interim rule which removed 7 CFR part 1809, subpart A, ``Appraisal of Farms and
Leasehold Interests,'' from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It also did the following: (1) Revised and renumbered part 1809 to FmHA Instruction 1922, subpart E_``Appraisal
of Farms and Leasehold Interests.''; (2) Issued revised &sect;1922.201 ``General'' (old &sect;1809.1 ``General'')
and (3) Issued new &sect;1922.209 ``Easements and appraising property subject to easements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other &sect;&sect;1809.2 through 1809.8 of subpart A were amended to meet USPAP and placed in &sect;&sect;1922.202
through 1922.208 of FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;E. Sections 1922.202 through 1922.208 were not published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because they involve internal Agency management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes were implemented upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to provide immediate guidance to FmHA designated farm real estate appraisers and FmHA contract farm real
estate appraisers concerning the use of the uniform standards as set out in Sections I, II and III of USPAP. This action
was necessary because most States enacted legislation and implemented FIRREA on January 1, 1993, and required farm
real estate appraisers to follow uniform appraisal standards or Sections I, II and III of USPAP. Further delays by
FmHA would have had an adverse impact on FmHA borrowers and loan applicants due to delays which may have resulted from
the continued use of outdated farm appraisal techniques and methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period ended September 24, 1993. No comments were received. Accordingly, no substantive change is made
from the interim rule. Minor editorial changes of an administrative nature have been made. Inadvertently, a few FmHA
Instructions were overlooked when revising references from FmHA Instruction 422.1 to FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subpart A of the Board's Regulation J (12 CFR part 210) governs the collection of checks and other items by Federal Reserve
Banks. Regulation J sets out the warranties made by institutions that send items for collection through the Federal
Reserve System as well as warranties made by Reserve Banks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulation J also covers liability for breach of warranty, presentment of and settlement for cash items and returned
checks, and other related issues.

As used in this docket, sender means any institution that sends a check to a Reserve Bank for collection, and bank includes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In October 1992, the Board published amendments to its Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) that require paying banks to
make same-day settlement for certain checks presented by private-sector banks, effective January 3, 1994 (57 FR
46956, October 14, 1992). As part of these amendments, the Board revised the Regulation CC warranties to require private-sector
collecting, returning, and presenting banks to warrant the accuracy of cash letter totals and check encoding. In
December 1993, the Board published proposed amendments to Regulation J to clarify that the Reserve Banks and institutions
that send items to Reserve Banks also make the Regulation CC warranties, to conform certain Regulation J provisions
to the 1990 version of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), and to make other minor changes (58 FR 68566, December
28, 1993). The Board received 10 comments on the proposed amendments, which are discussed in the section-by-section
analysis below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Board has established procedures for assessing the competitive impact of changes that have a substantial effect
on payments system participants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under these procedures, the Board assesses whether the proposed regulatory changes would have a direct and material
adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve Banks in
providing similar services due to differing legal powers or constraints or due to a dominant market position of the
Federal Reserve deriving from such legal differences. The Regulation J amendments are largely technical, clarifying,
or conform Regulation J to the rules applicable to private-sector banks under Regulation CC and the U.C.C. The Board
believes that the amendments would not have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of others to compete
effectively with the Federal Reserve Banks.

This section sets forth the authority, purpose, and scope of subpart A of Regulation J. At the suggestion of one commenter,
the Board is updating the authority citations in this section to conform with the authority citations in the CFR. Specifically,
the Board has added a citation to section 11(j) of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorizes the Board to exercise general
supervision over the Reserve Banks.

The Board proposed to amend the definition of ``item'' in keeping with the definition of ``item'' in U.C.C. &sect;4&hyph;104(a)(9).
Under the amended language, ``item'' would expressly include promises or orders, such as certain bonds or other investment
securities, that are handled through the bank collection system. The Board received no comments on this section and
has adopted the amendment as proposed.

The Board proposed to amend this section to set forth more accurately the scope of the Federal Reserve Banks' operating
circulars, which include provisions for service terms and adjustments. The amendment specifies that the operating
circulars may include provisions for adjustments of amounts, waiver of expenses, and payment of interest by as-of
adjustment.

One commenter believed that the proposed change, at least as it relates to Reserve Bank adjustment practices, impedes
the ability of correspondent banks to compete with the Reserve Banks. This commenter stated that the adjustment accounting
practices of its local Reserve Bank require intercept processors and depository institutions to engage in a burdensome
reconcilement process. The commenter stated that the Board should not incorporate the operating circulars into
Regulation J. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments, however, would not incorporate the operating circulars into Regulation J, but rather would
provide greater detail as to the scope of the operating circulars. Issues related to adjustment posting alternatives
generally can be settled between the Reserve Bank and the parties involved and would not be affected by the proposed
amendment to Regulation J. Thus, the Board has adopted the amendment as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to add a new paragraph to &sect;210.3 to clarify that Regulation J supersedes the U.C.C., other
state laws, and Regulation CC to the extent of any inconsistency. This provision parallels &sect;229.41 of Regulation
CC, which provides that Regulation CC supersedes the U.C.C. and other state law to the extent of the inconsistency.
The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.5(a) to conform the warranties made by banks that send items to Reserve Banks
to the transfer and presentment warranties in U.C.C. 4&hyph;207 and 4&hyph;208. A sender would warrant that it was
(or acted on behalf of a person who was) entitled to enforce the item. The U.C.C. substituted the concept of ``person
entitled to enforce'' for ``person with good title'' in recognition that the right to enforce an instrument is not
limited to holders. In addition, the proposed amendment would require the sender to warrant that the item was not altered,
dropping the adverb ``materially.'' The U.C.C. formerly incorporated the concept of a ``material'' alteration
as one that changed the contract of the parties in any respect. The revised U.C.C. refers to such a change simply as an
alteration. Finally, the proposed amendment would clarify that the sender also makes the warranties set forth in
Regulation CC and that the Regulation J warranties may not be disclaimed and are made regardless of whether the sender's
indorsement appears on the item. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned that dropping the word ``materially'' would mean that repair of MICR encoding on a check
that rejects from automated processing would constitute an alteration. Section 3&hyph;407 of the U.C.C. defines
``alteration'' as an unauthorized change that purports to modify the obligation of a party or an unauthorized addition
of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party. The 1990 version
of the U.C.C. appears to use the terms ``alteration'' synonymously with the former term ``material alteration''
(see Official Comment (1) to U.C.C. 3&hyph;407). MICR repair, which is intended to facilitate check collection and
not to affect the obligations of the parties to a check, is unlikely to be considered an alteration.

Sections 210.5(d) and 210.12(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to add new paragraph (d) to &sect;210.5 and new paragraph (i) to &sect;210.12 to give a Reserve Bank
a security interest in a sender's or prior collecting or returning bank's assets held by the Reserve Bank. The security
interest would attach when a warranty is breached or other obligation is incurred. The proposed provisions were based
on similar provisions in subpart B of Regulation J, which gives a Reserve Bank a security interest in the assets of a
sender of a payment order to secure overdrafts and other obligations (&sect;210.28(b) (3) and (4)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters were concerned that the proposal would give Reserve Banks greater rights than private-sector banks
to resolve warranty breach issues. One of the commenters stated that the proposal appeared to give Reserve Banks a
complete self-remedy for breaches absent a court order or agreement of the parties. The commenter noted that security
interests under &sect;210.28 are designed to secure overdrafts, which are easily determinable, as opposed to warranty
breaches, which are often a matter of dispute. The commenter requested that the proposal be clarified to provide that
security interests do not attach and a Reserve Bank may not set off or realize upon collateral without a judicial determination
or agreement of the parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9&hyph;501(5) of the U.C.C. provides that when a claim of a secured party is reduced to judgment, the secured
party's lien on collateral relates back to the date the security interest was perfected. Accordingly, the Board believes
that a Reserve Bank's security interest in the assets of a warranting bank should attach on the date the warranty is
breached (generally the date the Reserve Bank handles the check in question) so that the Reserve Bank may take actions
to protect its collateral, if necessary, as discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Monetary Control Act of 1980 (12 U.S.C. 248a) directed the Board and the Reserve Banks to establish and set prices
for services with due consideration to ensuring an adequate level of services nationwide. In keeping with this directive,
the Board expects that Reserve Banks will provide check collection services to financially troubled banks that cannot
obtain services elsewhere. If a troubled bank fails, the Reserve Bank may be liable on warranty claims that it cannot
pass back to the failed bank. Accordingly, the Board believes that it is appropriate to provide some protection to
the Reserve Banks from pending insolvencies. Thus, the Board has adopted the proposed security interest provisions,
with modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications to &sect;&sect;229.5(d) and 229.12(i) clarify when a default occurs. Specifically, a Reserve
Bank's rights to take any action under those sections will apply only: (1) If the Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion,
deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender or (2) at the time the sender suspends payments and is closed.
The Board believes that requiring the Reserve Bank to advise a bank of its concerns about the bank's solvency will prevent
the routine use of set-off or other actions on collateral by Reserve Banks. The Board believes that private-sector
banks often reserve the right under security agreements to take steps, such as placing a hold on collateral, to protect
themselves in cases where the banks consider themselves insecure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, when a Reserve Bank receives notice of a warranty claim based on alleged forged indorsement or
alteration, it would pass the notice back to the bank from which it received the check. The Reserve Bank would not, however,
unilaterally pass judgment on such a claim. Rather, the Reserve Banks' uniform operating circulars provide that
they will process adjustments for these types of warranty claims only with the agreement of the prior collecting bank.
If such agreement is not forthcoming, the Reserve Bank would wait to be sued on the warranty claim and would tender defense
of the suit to the prior collecting bank under &sect;&sect;210.5 (b) and (c) and 210.12 (e) and (f) of Regulation J.
Entries would be made or collateral disposed of only after judgment as provided in those sections. The amendments
to &sect;&sect;229.5(d) and 229.12(i), however, would not require a sender bank to fail or a Reserve Bank to deem itself
insecure before the Reserve Bank could make credit or debit adjustments to reserve or clearing accounts in accordance
with adjustment procedures established in Reserve Bank operating circulars.

Section 210.6(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.6(b) to conform the Reserve Bank warranties to the transfer and presentment
warranties in U.C.C. 4&hyph;207 and 4&hyph;208. (See discussion of &sect;210.5(a).) The amendment clarifies that
the Reserve Banks make the warranties set out in &sect;229.34 of Regulation CC. The Board received no comments on this
section and has adopted the amendment as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 210.6(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210.6(c) provides a 2-year statute of limitations for claims against Reserve Banks for lack of good faith
or failure to exercise ordinary care under Regulation J. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that the
Regulation CC limitation period of one year would apply to any claims against a Reserve Bank under Regulation CC, such
as breach of a warranty under &sect;229.34 or lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care under &sect;229.38.
This amendment clarifies that claims against Reserve Banks for Regulation CC violations are subject to the same time
limitations as those against private-sector banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board received three comments on this section. Two commenters believed that limitation period for breach of Regulation
CC warranties should be two years rather than one year. One of these commenters often receives adjustment requests
from the IRS one to two years after the fact and does not wish to be precluded from pursuing such adjustments with a Reserve
Bank. This commenter suggested that the Regulation CC limitation period be extended to 2 years. Another commenter
noted that, if the one year limitation period is adopted, it should run from the date of the last entry for the check in
question rather than from the date the check first cleared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the same limitation period should apply to Reserve Banks and private-sector banks for Regulation
CC violations. As Regulation CC provides a one-year statute of limitations, the Board does not believe Regulation
J should lengthen this period for Reserve Banks and has adopted the proposed amendment. The one-year period was established
in subpart C of Regulation CC to match the one-year limitation period for subpart B (funds availability) violations,
which was set by statute. As provided in Regulation CC &sect;229.38(g), an action must be brought within one year after
the date of the occurrence of the violation involved.

Section 210.9(a)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210.9(a)(5) provides that paying banks must settle for checks presented by Reserve Banks by ``autocharge''
(i.e. a debit to an account at a Reserve Bank), cash, or other means agreed to by the Reserve Bank. The Board proposed
to amend this section to clarify that a Reserve Bank may, in its discretion, elect to obtain settlement by autocharging
the account of the paying bank for the amount of a cash letter. Virtually all Reserve Bank presentments are settled
via autocharge. This amendment would restate the autocharge provisions that currently are set out in the Reserve
Banks' uniform cash item operating circular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also proposed to amend this section to provide that paying banks that receive presentment from Reserve Banks
may not set off other claims against the amount of settlement owed to the Reserve Bank. Paying banks may set off against
private-sector presenting banks under &sect;229.34(c)(4) of Regulation CC. The Regulation CC set-off provision
was designed to protect paying banks under the same-day settlement rule, which requires paying banks to accept presentment
from and settle with all presenting banks, some of which may be in poor financial condition. If a paying bank overpays
a cash letter in reliance on a cash letter total or check encoding warranted by the presenting bank, it could face the
risk that the presenting bank would be unable to settle for adjustments. Protection against insolvency risk would
not be necessary against a Reserve Bank. In addition, as banks generally settle with Reserve Banks via autocharge,
set-off against a Reserve Bank would be impractical. Therefore, the Board does not believe this amendment would have
a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of private-sector banks to compete effectively with Reserve Banks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210.12(a) provides that a paying bank that has settled for a check presented by a Reserve Bank may return the
check in accordance with Regulation CC, the U.C.C., and the Reserve Bank's operating circular. The Board proposed
to amend this section to clarify that the paying bank may also return a check prior to settlement in accordance with
&sect;210.9(a) of Regulation J and the Reserve Bank's operating circular. This amendment would clarify that a paying
bank would have the same return rights under Regulation J as under Regulation CC and the U.C.C. The Board received no
comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.

Section 210.12(c) sets out the warranties and agreements made by a bank that sends a returned check to a Reserve Bank.
The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that, in addition to the warranties set forth in &sect;229.34 of
Regulation CC, the sender also makes any applicable warranty under state law. For example, the amendment would clarify
that a depositary bank that settled for a returned check could recover the amount paid plus expenses and lost interest
from a prior bank that breached a transfer warranty, in accordance with U.C.C. 4&hyph;208(d). In addition, similar
to the amendments to &sect;210.5(a), the proposed revisions to this paragraph would clarify that the Regulation
J warranties may not be disclaimed and are made regardless of whether the sender's indorsement appears on the item.
These amendments restate provisions that are already applicable to private-sector banks under Regulation CC and
the U.C.C. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.

The Board proposed to add a new paragraph (d) to &sect;210.12 to clarify that when a Reserve Bank transfers and receives
settlement for a returned check, it makes the warranties set out in &sect;229.34 of Regulation CC. In addition, the
new paragraph would parallel revised &sect;210.6(b) (governing Reserve Bank warranties for cash items) by providing
a limitation of the Reserve Bank's liabilities, other than those allowed for in Regulation J, to the Reserve Bank's
own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care. (The amendments redesignate current &sect;&sect;210.12(d)
through (g) as &sect;&sect;210.12(e) through (h).) The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.C.C. (3&hyph;119) and Regulation CC (&sect;229.34(e)) provide that a bank that receives a tender of defense
may in turn tender defense to a prior bank in the collection or return chain. Unless the prior bank comes in and defends,
it is bound by the determination of fact common to the current litigation and any subsequent litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 210.5(b) of Regulation J provides that, when a Reserve Bank tenders defense to a sender as a result of a tender
to it, the Reserve Bank need not be a defendant in the suit in order to recover from the sender any losses that it incurs
because of the judgment, so long as the judgment addresses the fact issue of breach of warranty. The Board adopted this
provision in 1986 in order to reduce litigation and provide a more efficient way of handling forged indorsement cases
(51 FR 21740, June 16, 1986). Due to an oversight, when the Board amended &sect;210.12 to provide a similar rule for
returned checks, the language did not match that of &sect;210.5(b) and could have been interpreted to apply only when
a Reserve Bank is a defendant (53 FR 21983, June 13, 1988). The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.12(e) to conform it
to &sect;210.5(b). (The amendments redesignate current &sect;210.12(d) as &sect;210.12(e) and add a new paragraph
(d) as discussed above.) The Board also proposed to correct a typographical error in &sect;210.5(b). The Board received

This section provides that a depositary bank must settle for returned checks received from a Reserve Bank in the same
manner as it settles for cash items presented by the Reserve Bank. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify
that settlement for returned checks also must be made by the same time as settlement for cash items, as provided in &sect;210.9(a).

Section 210.13(a) authorizes a Reserve Bank that does not receive payment for an item to charge back the account of
the sender, paying bank, or returning bank from which the item was received. The Board proposed to amend this section
to clarify that a Reserve Bank also may charge the account of a prior collecting bank through which the item was received.
This amendment is consistent with &sect;229.35(b) of Regulation CC, which allows a bank that handles a check or returned
check to recover from any prior indorser in the event that the bank does not receive payment for the check from a subsequent
bank in the collection or return chain. In the event of such a recovery by a Reserve Bank, &sect;229.13(a) provides
that no bank or person in the forward collection or return chain would have an interest in any funds in the Reserve Bank's
possession of the bank that failed to pay. The amendment would clarify that, when a Reserve Bank charges back an item,
this limitation of interest applies only when a bank or person seeks payment of the amount of the item out of funds or
property held by the Reserve Bank. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.

notice the institution is closed. The amendment also would clarify that this section applies only to charges to reserve
accounts to settle for items (including returned checks) and does not affect the Reserve Bank's security interest

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 12, 1992, the Board approved several proposals to change certain procedures for obtaining Board approval
of various applications and notices filed under the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Holding Company Act, the Bank Merger
Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and various other statutes. All but one of these changes to the Board's application
and notice review procedures were implemented by the Board at that time. Most of these changes involved revising certain
internal procedures of the Federal Reserve System (System), to improve the efficiency of processing applications
that are reviewed by the Board in conjunction with the Reserve Banks and to reduce the regulatory burden associated
with these application and notice procedures. Two of the changes_eliminating the stock redemption notice requirement
for ``well-capitalized'' bank holding companies, and modifying the Board's delegation rules pertaining to competition
and market concentration_necessitate amendments to certain provisions of, respectively, the Board's Regulation
Y and Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority.

See 57 FR 39641 (September 1, 1992). These changes included establishing certain procedures to limit extension of
the pre-acceptance period for applications; offering prospective applicants the opportunity to submit a pre-filing
notice of intent to file an application; eliminating the stock redemption notice requirement for bank holding companies
that are and, following the redemption would remain, ``well-capitalized'' on a consolidated basis and in generally
satisfactory condition; expanding the authority of Reserve Banks to process all delegable applications without
Board staff review; modifying the Board's delegation rules pertaining to competition and market concentration;
reducing redundant post-acceptance processing of Board action cases; increasing the monitoring of cases requiring
extended processing; and establishing a general consent procedure under section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act for
investments by state member banks in bank premises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In publishing notice of these changes, the Board also invited comment on any additional measures to eliminate or reduce
burden associated with the Board's notice and application procedures. The comments received will be considered
by the Board in its ongoing efforts to streamline and reduce the regulatory burden associated with the Board's notice
and application procedures.

Currently, &sect;225.4(b)(1) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.4(b)(1)) requires a bank holding company to give the Board
prior notice of certain purchases or redemptions of its equity securities:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A bank holding company shall give the Board prior notice before purchasing or redeeming its equity securities, if
the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company
for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 percent or more of the company's
consolidated net worth. For the purposes of this section, ``net consideration'' is the gross consideration paid
by the company for all of its equity securities purchased or redeemed during the period minus the gross consideration
received for all of its equity securities sold during the period other than as part of a new issue.

The Board determined to eliminate this notice requirement for bank holding companies that are and, following the
redemption or purchase, would remain ``well-capitalized'' on a consolidated basis and in generally satisfactory
condition. The Board believes that a bank holding company would qualify for this exception to the notice requirement
if:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The total and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and the leverage capital ratio for the bank holding company,
both before and following the redemption, exceed the thresholds established for ``well-capitalized'' state-member
banks under 12 CFR 208.33(b)(1) as if the bank holding company (on a consolidated basis) were deemed to be a state-member
bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The bank holding company received a composite ``1'' or ``2'' rating at its most recent BOPEC inspection, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The bank holding company is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also determined to revise its delegation rules pertaining to competition and market concentration. If
a party submits an application or notice to the System pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act, Change in Bank Control
Act, Bank Merger Act, or the Bank Service Corporation Act, the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12
CFR 265.1&hyph;265.11), permit the appropriate Reserve Bank to act on such application or notice unless certain
circumstances are present. Specifically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;265.11(c)(11)(v) of the Board's Rules provide that a Reserve Bank is not authorized to approve the following
transactions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) With respect to BHC formations, bank acquisitions or mergers, the proposed transaction involves two or more banking
organizations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) That upon consummation of the proposal, would control over 30 percent of total deposits in banking offices in the
relevant geographic market, or would result in an increase of at least 200 points in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
(HHI) in a highly concentrated market (a market with a post-merger HHI of at least 1800); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Where divestitures designed to address any substantive anticompetitive effects are not effected on or before
consummation of the proposed transaction[.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board determined to revise its Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority to increase the resulting market share
criterion that would require Board consideration of a bank merger or acquisition from 30 percent to 35 percent. In
particular, the Reserve Banks may now act on applications involving two or more banking organizations that, upon
consummation of the proposed transaction, would control 35 percent or less of total deposits in banking offices in
the relevant geographic market. This change would also reflect the Board's practice, in computing market share,
of weighing deposits of thrifts in the subject market at 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this change to the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority, the Board also determined to eliminate
the need for Board approval of applications involving divestitures designed to address anticompetitive effects,
which divestitures are not completed on or before consummation of the proposed transaction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a result, the Federal Reserve Banks may now act on applications involving proposed divestitures to address competitive
concerns, provided the divestitures are undertaken in accordance with the Board's position on the timing of divestitures.

The provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. 553) relating to notice, public participation,
and deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments because the
changes to be effected are either procedural in nature and do not constitute a substantive rule subject to the requirements
of that section, or grant an exemption and reduce regulatory burden. The APA grants specific exemptions from its requirements
relating to notice, public participation and the deferred effective date requirements in these instances (12 U.S.C.
553 (b)(3)(A) and (d)(1)).

This action establishes Class D airspace at El Toro, CA, designated as an extension to a Class C surface area. The floor
was inadvertently lowered from a base of 2,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) down to the surface. This modification raises
the floor between the 10 and 15 mile radius of the Class D airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet MSL. The area will be
depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

History

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 31, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class
D airspace at El Toro, CA (59 FR 8565). The Class D airspace was inadvertenly changed during Airspace Reclassification.
This change restricted aircraft transiting along the shoreline. This action will raise the floor of a portion of the
Class D airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet MSL to allow aircraft to transit along the shoreline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA and there were no objections to the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class D airspace designations for airspace designated as extensions to class C airspace are published in Paragraph
5000b of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation modifies Class D airspace at El Toro, CA, to establish
Class D airspace from 2,500 fee MSL to 4,400 feet MSL for aircraft transiting between the 10 and 15 mile radius of MCAS
El Toro, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body by technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regularly Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend
the Class D airspace for the Grant County Airport, Moses Lake, Washington (59 FR 8567). Interested parties were invited
to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No
comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``control zone,''
and airspace extending upward from the surface with an operating airport traffic control tower is now designated
Class D airspace. Class D airspace designations for airspace extending upward from the surface with an operating
airport traffic control tower are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule
are in North America Datum 83.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Moses Lake, Washington. It
will permit air traffic operations at the Moses Lake Municipal Airport without the requirement for direct radio communications
with the airport traffic control tower at the Grant County Airport by excluding the Moses Lake Municipal Airport from
the Grant County Airport Class D airspace. It improves the efficiency at Moses Lake Municipal Airport without significantly
impacting on the operation at the Grant County Airport operation, and simplifies air traffic control activities
within the Class D airspace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends the Class E airspace at Rifle, CO. Establishment of a new instrument approach procedure requires
additional controlled airspace for the procedure. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993,
has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' The
Class E airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference when the new approach procedures become
effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 18, 1994, the FAA proposed to amended part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend
the Class E airspace for the Rifle Garfield County Airport, Rifle, CO (59 FR 8147). Interested parties were invited
to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No
comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,''
and airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level is now designated as Class E airspace. Class E airspace
designations for airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North American Datum 83.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace to Rifle, Colorado. It will provide
controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the airport. Amendment of the Class E airspace will
result in greater safety and efficiency at, and in the vicinity of, the airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation
only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary
to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.
Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
80 Stat. 379, 39 Stat. 277, as amended; and 5 U.S.C. 301, U.S.C. 5114 give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority
of law to adopt a new distinctive paper for use in printing United States currency and other interest-bearing securities
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The changes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Amend section 601.2 to reflect a description of the new threaded distinctive paper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amend section 601.3 to indicate that the distinctive paper currently in use will continue to be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Amend section 601.4 to provide that the existing distinctive paper will continue to be used for printing interest-bearing
securities of the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, BEP published Notice No. 1 (58 FR 59973), proposing to amend the provisions of Distinctive Paper
for United States Currency and Other Securities regulations to reflect the adoption of a new distinctive paper adopted
for use by the Secretary of the Treasury to deter counterfeiting. No comments were received on or before the closing
date of December 13, 1993. Therefore, BEP is adopting the language in the proposed rule, with no modification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this document will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required because the final rule is not expected:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To have secondary, or incidental effects on a substantial number of small entities; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To impose, or otherwise cause a significant increase in the reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance burdens
of a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this document is not a major regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and a regulatory
impact analysis is not required because it will not have any annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; it
will not result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local
government agencies or geographical regions; and it will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,
investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign
based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 9, 1986, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), submitted amendments to the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC) Chapter 3745&hyph;21 to USEPA as proposed revisions to the SIP for Ozone. OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 consists
of emission limitations and control requirements for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The amendments
to OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 involve certain compliance deadlines and source specific exemptions from otherwise
applicable emission limitations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 9, 1986, the OEPA submitted amendments to OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21 and supporting data to USEPA as a proposed
revision to the ozone portion of its SIP. OEPA adopted these rules in final form on March 21, 1986. OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21,
entitled, ``Carbon Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related Materials Standards,''
includes Ohio's VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT I and II) regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio's submittal included new VOC regulations for additional source categories not specifically covered by Ohio's
existing rules and a site-specific revision for the Huffy Corporation. These other elements of the April 9, 1986,
submittal are not covered in this document. Today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document also does not address those amendments to the ozone SIP that were previously submitted on March 28, 1983,
to USEPA, and were addressed in a March 6, 1985 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 notice of proposed rulemaking (50 FR 9052) and in a January 18, 1989, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 final rulemaking (54 FR 1934). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations subject to this rulemaking are embodied in OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, Definitions; OAC
Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04, Attainment dates and compliance time schedules; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09,
Control of emissions of volatile organic compounds from stationary sources; and OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;10,
Compliance test methods and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA is taking final action to approve these revisions, with the following exceptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. USEPA is disapproving the proposed relaxation for food can end sealing compounds in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (D)(1)(e)
and (D)(2)(e) from 3.7 to 4.4 lbs VOC/gal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. USEPA is disapproving the proposed revision to the exemption, as well as the entire exemption in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e)
for the application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio's high ratio of emulsified to cutback asphalt used in 1987 is not a valid basis for exempting the hand application
of cutback asphalt. This exemption is inconsistent with USEPA guidance, and Ohio has provided no data on the amount
of additional cutback asphalt that would be used in the ozone season as a result of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, USEPA is disapproving the recordkeeping requirements in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(4) because they
are inadequate with respect to the time period during which records are required because paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09
(N)(4) only deals with recordkeeping requirements and not when cutback asphalt is allowed to be used. Ohio's SIP does
not allow cutback asphalt to be used from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 15 through October 15. Unless and until the exemption period is changed (in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (N)(3)),
the recordkeeping requirements must reflect the SIP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. USEPA is disapproving the relaxation from 3.5 to 6.2 lbs. VOC/gal for high performance architectural aluminum
coatings in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii) because Ohio did not document the infeasibility of add-on controls
and powder coatings in support of its proposed relaxation. USEPA will evaluate the merits of a compliance date extension
if submitted and supported by OEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, USEPA will repropose rulemaking on the relaxation for miscellaneous metal parts, in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09
(U)(1)(vii), and USEPA will propose rulemaking on the exemption for new sources, in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(2)(f),

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OEPA proposed a relaxation from 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (lbs VOC/gallon of coating, excluding water)
to 4.4 lbs/gal for food can end sealing compounds. OEPA's basis includes a September 13, 1985, letter and testimony
to OEPA from Heekin Can; an April 13, 1984, submittal from the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) to USEPA; and testimony
presented by Campbell Soup Company before the OEPA on September 12, 1985. The basis of the can industry's requests
for a relaxation is the purported unavailability of complying end sealing compounds for food can ends, as well as the
infeasibility of add-on control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA proposed disapproval of this relaxation because data from a San Diego source (Van Camp) indicates the possible
feasibility of both add-on control equipment and low solvent coatings, and Ohio had not considered this information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Comments on Proposed Disapproval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Heekin Can, Campbell Soup, Central States Company, OEPA, and the Can Manufacturers Institute commented on the proposed
disapproval. Their comments, and USEPA's response to these comments are enumerated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Campbell Soup Company Submitted the Following Comments on July 27, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendment should now be approved by USEPA in total: The data cited by USEPA in the notice of proposed rulemaking
is, on its face, not an appropriate basis for rejection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data cited by USEPA in its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) provided a strong indication that use of add-on control
equipment may be feasible for controlling end seal compound VOC emissions. However, after reviewing the comments,
USEPA agrees that use of add-on control equipment doesn't appear feasible. In addition, Van Camp has switched over
to a solventless, waterborne end sealing compound for its pet food cans. However, USEPA has considered other relevant
information, as discussed in this notice, including comments received, in conjunction with the data cited in the
NPR, in its final evaluation of the proposed relaxation. Therefore, any shortcomings, or limitations, in the data
cited in the NPR, have been taken into consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Amendment cannot now be approved in total, it should at least be approved in part, by allowing relaxation of VOC
standards for the period when compliance would otherwise have been technically and commercially impracticable,
i.e., at least until May 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Only with Campbell's May 1989 conversion to a compliant end-sealing compound, following extensive research and
development efforts funded by Campbell to develop and apply such a compound, is there evidence that a 3.7 pound standard
became technically and commercially feasible for Campbell's Ohio facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA can only act on a proposed revision that has been submitted to it. Therefore, USEPA's only option is to approve
or disapprove a permanent relaxation of the food can end sealing compound limit. It should be emphasized that as of
May 1989 Campbell came into compliance with the 3.7 pounds VOC per gallon food can end seal compound limit. Therefore,
USEPA does not believe approval of the permanent relaxation is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If relaxation of the VOC standard to 4.4 pounds for the period ending May 1989, cannot now be approved for the entire
food can end sealing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound category, it should at least be allowed for such period for the human food can end sealing compound category.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the response to comment 2, USEPA can only act on a proposed revision that has been submitted to it. The submitted
rule provides for a relaxation for the entire category and cannot be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, if the Amendment cannot now be approved in whole or in part, it should not now be rejected with prejudice.
Rather, OEPA should be given a chance to modify or supplement the Amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``USEPA's proposed rulemaking notes that OEPA did not consider certain Van Camp data, i.e., the Lake paper which,
in fact, was only publicly presented after the date the Amendment was submitted to USEPA. Accordingly, if the Amendment
cannot now be approved in whole or part, and if such data is still deemed relevant by USEPA, these proceedings should
be remanded without prejudice to OEPA so that the data can be considered, findings made, and, if deemed appropriate
by OEPA, the Amendment resubmitted to USEPA in the same or modified form after the new data has been fully considered.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA has an obligation to act on any pending SIP revision request and does not have the authority to ``remand'' such
a submittal to the State. However, the State has the ability to withdraw or amend a pending SIP revision request at any
time prior to final USEPA action. After USEPA takes final action on a SIP submittal, the State still may submit revisions
to the existing SIP. USEPA will act on any proposed SIP revision submitted by Ohio in the future including additional
relaxation requests for end sealing compounds. Any relaxation would need to be consistent with section 193 of the
amended CAA. Moreover, it should be noted that USEPA has considered comments from OEPA on the Van Camp data in its final
evaluation.

2. Heekin Can Submitted Comments on July 27, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These comments include background information, comments on the infeasibility of add-on controls, and comments
on the unavailability of low solvent compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before reviewing the infeasibility and unavailability issues it should be recognized that the level of VOCs that
was emitted at the Heekin facility in 1987 as a result of following the food can end seal regulation (4.4 pounds of VOC
per gallon) instead of the general VOC content end seal limitation (3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon) amounted to only 27.89
tons of VOC. Total VOC emissions from the entire end seal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation at the facility were 219.27 tons for 1987, while plant-wide emissions (base coaters, litho presses, side
seam strippers, and end seal liner machines) were 652 tons per year after controls. Thus, the level of emissions sought
to be restricted by disapproving the food can end seal VOC limit is only 4.2 percent of the emissions from the facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The level of control technology that constitutes RACT is a function of technical and economical feasibility, and
not emission impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, excess emissions of 27.89 tons of VOC per year is not a negligible quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2_Infeasibility of Add-on Controls:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of USEPA's reliance on the Lake article and the Van 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Camp study, Heekin commissioned a RACT study by Camp, Dresser, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
McKee (CDM). CDM focused on collecting VOCs from the application, conveying, and bagging stages of the end seal lining
process. Warehousing areas were disregarded by Lake and CDM as being infeasible to control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDM performed a complete RACT analysis tailored specifically for Heekin's Hamilton County, Ohio can manufacturing
facility. A total of five end seal lining processes (10 applicators) were considered for control. Before discussing
the results of CDM's RACT study, it should be noted that CDM disregarded the carbon adsorption control option because
of the difficulties encountered with regeneration. Steam regeneration of spent carbon creates a hazardous waste
requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costly disposal. Hot air regeneration requires an incinerator which duplicates the incinerator control technology
option. Also, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that hexane, the major solvent in the end seal lining compounds, has a poor adsorption efficiency. Thus,
Lake's reporting of a cost effectiveness figure for a carbon adsorption collection system is not supported by CDM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDM focused on thermal and catalytic incineration as preferable control options and determined that the capital
cost for a catalytic incinerator system was $1,854,600, approximately $320,000 higher than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capital cost of a thermal incineration system. The annual operating expense for the catalytic incineration system
was estimated to be $1,608,719 per year, $2,008,719 per year for thermal incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dividing the annual cost to operate the control system by the quantity of VOC reduced yields the ``cost effectiveness''
of the control system. CDM's analysis utilized three figures for the quantity of VOC removed per year: (1) The quantity
of VOC removed to reach equivalence with the general end seal compound limit of 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon (i.e., 27.89
tons per year); (2) the quantity of VOC removed assuming a 40 percent capture efficiency (i.e., 87.70 tons per year);
and (3) the quantity of VOC removed assuming that Perlis' 80 percent capture efficiency is correct (i.e., 175.4 tons
per year). Heekin does not believe that an 80 percent collection efficiency on the system is possible but has calculated
the ``cost effectiveness'' for comparison purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDM determined the following ``cost effectiveness'' figures. For scenario one, removal of sufficient VOCs to reach
equivalence with the 3.7 pounds per gallon emission rate limitation, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $71,597 per ton
of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $57,681 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario
two, removal of VOCs with a 40 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $23,235 per ton of VOC removed
for thermal incineration and $19,310 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario three, removal
of VOCs with an 80 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $10,853 per ton of VOC removed for thermal
incineration and $9,020 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the above detailed ``cost effectiveness'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures were calculated based on can end residence times through the collection system reported by Lake. However,
Heekin's actual residence times are much shorter. Lake reported a total residence time for Van Camp of 1.5 minutes.
During the Perlis test, a residence time of 3.0 minutes was contrived to gain an 87 percent capture efficiency. Heekin's
process lines have a total residence time from lining to stacking/bagging of only 20 to 65 seconds. The discrepancy
between Heekin's residence time and the Van Camp/Perlis residence times means that the collection efficiencies
for the capture system if it were to be installed at Heekin would be much lower than the collection efficiencies reported
by Lake. Thus, the cost effectiveness figures estimated by CDM are on the low side compared to what Heekin could actually
attain because the amount of VOCs removed would be much lower.

USEPA Response:

 Add-on control is not used on any end seal compound coating lines. USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible
for this application.

Comment 3_Unavailability of Low Solvent Compounds:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 USEPA stated in its proposed disapproval of Ohio's Food Can End Regulation that the Lake article and the Van Camp data
indicated ``possible feasibility'' of low solvent coatings. According to the article, Van Camp was successful at
replacing ``9101'' compound with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-based end sealing compound, ``480T''. The replacement compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was used by Van Camp to manufacture ends to be used for pet food cans. Van Camp continued to use the ``9101'' compound
for its human consumption product line, tuna fish cans. Thus, Van Camp came into compliance with the 3.7 pounds of VOC
per gallon limitation by averaging noncompliant VOC emissions from ``9101'' usage with water-based emissions from
``480T'' usage. The Van Camp facility continues to operate in this fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before addressing the viability of the low solvent coating option, one must understand the distinction between a
``captive'' and a ``merchant'' can manufacturer. A ``captive'' can manufacturer supplies cans only for one customer,
itself. Conversely, a ``merchant'' can manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies cans for several customers according to the customer's varied requirements and individualized specifications.
Thus, a ``merchant'' manufacturer has little control over the coatings it must use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabricate the cans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heekin is a ``merchant'' manufacturer. Van Camp was a ``captive'' manufacturer at the time of the Lake article. Thus,
the feasibility of a lower solvent coating for Heekin is complicated by additional determining factors that Van Camp
does not have (i.e., Heekin must satisfy the customer's manufacturing requirements and Heekin has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leverage or internal pressure by which to force a customer to make a change). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the first promulgation of the RACT regulations, Heekin has made a concerted effort at advising and steering
its customers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying coatings and compounds with low solvent formulations. With regard to end seal liner compounds, however,
Heekin is serving several customers that have refused to accept a low solvent formulation as a replacement to the end
seal liner compound with VOC contents exceeding 3.7 pounds per gallon. The major customer in this category is Ross
Laboratories in Columbus, Ohio. Ross Laboratories is the nation's largest producer of milk and soy protein infant
formulas. They also manufacture medical nutritional products for hospital and home use. Ross has made the determination
that ``1105'' compound is the only suitable compound for fabricating cans for these highly sensitive products. Other

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national food processing customers specifying ``1105'' and ``9101'' end seal compounds include: Quaker Oats Company,
American Home Foods, and Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disallowing the food can end seal regulation will put Heekin at a disadvantage in the ``merchant'' can manufacturer's
market. When approached by Heekin representatives regarding the possibility that Heekin may no longer be able to
use ``1105'', the manager of the purchasing department stated that an option for Ross Laboratories, if the regulation
is disapproved and Heekin no longer can supply ``1105'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends, is to move its business to another ``merchant'' can manufacturer that is not restricted by the end seal liner
RACT regulation. Thus, since low solvent end seal compounds are not an option for Heekin's customers, Heekin must
have the ability to continue to use the ``9101'' and ``1105'' compounds for food can ends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Heekin has not adequately demonstrated that 4.4 lbs VOC per gallon is RACT for food can end sealing compounds for the
following reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Other State regulations have a 3.7 lbs/gallon limit for end sealing compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) amended its can coating rules (in early 1990). These regulations
specify 3.7 lbs/gallon for end sealing compounds for food cans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Campbell Soup stated, in its comments, that in May 1989, Campbell converted to a compliant end sealing compound,
following extensive research and development efforts funded by Campbell to develop and apply such a compound. This
is ``evidence that a 3.7 pound standard became technically and commercially feasible for Campbell's Ohio facility.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There is no indication that 3.7 lbs/gallon end sealing compounds are unavailable for certain type food cans, e.g.,
pet food cans and fruit and vegetable cans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Heekin has not demonstrated that it made a substantial effort to develop and/or locate complying end seal compounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In its June 27, 1989, letter, Ross Laboratories states that there are no qualified replacements, to Dewey and Almy's
``1105'' end seal compound, available. The letter falls short of saying that they would refuse to use any other suitable
product, if it exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The fact that Heekin is a ``merchant'' manufacturer is not a sufficient reason for it to have a less stringent limit.
Job shops are common in the coating industry and have not in the past been given special consideration because they
have to deal with a number of customers. The feasibility of compliant end seal compounds for Heekin's customers' cans
is more relevant than its status as a ``merchant'' manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, USEPA does agree that 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds for certain applications may not be available. A
July 12, 1989, letter from Neil Moyer, (then) Director of Rule Development for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCAQMD, states that compliant end seal compounds are a problem for cans used for tuna and other oily products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heekin may, in fact, have a problem with end seal compounds for certain products. However, USEPA does not have the ability
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create exemptions for Heekin. The State has not submitted such a rule. The State submitted relaxation (to 4.4 lbs/gallon)
for all end seal compounds is overly broad and cannot be approved. Furthermore, Heekin has not adequately demonstrated
the lowest VOC content feasible for its end seal compounds for specified applications.

3. Central States Can Company Submitted Comments on July 26, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would be interested to know if there are any end lines running with off-line controls that can maintain a reduction
efficiency of 76 percent (80% capture, 95% control) over a long period of time. The type of control systems that could
be used on end lining systems would require a residence time of several hours and seem to be totally impractical considering
the size required and the operational cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA is not aware of add-on control being used on any end seal compound coating lines. USEPA agrees that add-on control
is not feasible for this application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We note that the ``480T'' compound has been used on pet food. OEPA (presumably commenter means USEPA) seems to be proposing
its use on all foods on the basis of tests with pet food. It should be pointed out that many other products besides pet
food (including infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula) are packed and should be considered before such a change is made. The USEPA cannot ignore food safety in its
proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA agrees that there appear to be some products which cannot use 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds. However, there
appear to be some food cans (e.g., pet food cans) which can use compliant end seal compounds. It is the State's responsibility
to demonstrate that the requirements it submits are RACT. The burden is on the State to show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which cans another limit (above 3.7) is RACT and what is that appropriate limit. For example, an adequate demonstration
has not been made of the lowest VOC content feasible for end seal compounds used for products such as infant formula.
Because the State has submitted a general relaxation of the end seal limit and has not demonstrated that the relaxed
limit is RACT for all end seal compounds, USEPA cannot approve the relaxation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we are confident that other foods can successfully use an alternate compound, it is important that these products
be tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to making such a change. It is not unreasonable that this testing for all products may require as much as 5 years.
It is, therefore, requested that the Ohio proposed relaxation be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for testing does not, in itself, justify a permanent relaxation. Central States Can has provided no specifics
about food safety testing, and it is therefore not possible to evaluate the effects it would have. The nature and length
of the testing is also not specified. Furthermore, there are no details or support for the Central States comment that
``It is not unreasonable that this testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all products may require as much as 5 years.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. The Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) Submitted Comments on July 28, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CMI supports OEPA's action to raise the VOC end seal compound limits. CMI's specific comments are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
CMI's Position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CMI opposes the basis of USEPA's proposed denial of Ohio's revision of end seal compound VOC limits. We believe USEPA's
reliance on the study of Van Camp's efforts in San Diego is misguided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, CMI is concerned that the Agency is willing to risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangering the food supply or forcing Ohio-based can makers to surrender business to obtain minuscule gains in the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Van Camp Study by Michael Lake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, Michael Lake of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District, San Diego, California, presented a paper
entitled ``VOC Emission Control for Can End Sealing Compounds: A Case History.'' This study outlines the Van Camp
Company's experience in testing, qualifying and running water-based end seal compound. It also broached the possibility
of using add-on equipment around end seal application operations. USEPA cites Van Camp's narrow experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with add-on control equipment and water-based end seal compound as the rationale for denying Ohio's proposed rules
3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (D)(1)(e) and (D)(2)(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Add-On Controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The add-on control equipment referred to in the Lake study was not installed on a permanent basis. The Van Camp plant
managers in 1987 told CMI that initial tests of mock-up add-on equipment showed the system was impractical from an
engineering and production standpoint. The Lake study cites three very serious concerns of Van Camp concerning add-on
control equipment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The prototype VOC containment/capture system had not been tested under rigorous, extended-production conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The system might not allow sufficient visual and physical access by line operators; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Carbon adsorption was and still is an unproven technology for control of VOC emissions from can end sealing lines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMI asserts that a theoretical system which did not prove practical, safe or efficacious should not be used as a basis
for USEPA to deny a reasonable regulatory action by Ohio's environmental authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Water-Based End Seal Compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of the Van Camp Study on water-based end seal compound to deny relaxation of the Ohio VOC limits wrongly assumes
these test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions are acceptable to qualify end seal compound for other types of packs and containers. The process required
to safely qualify a new end seal compound is linked to different packing and food conditions. As a general rule, more
testing is required for materials which are used on a broad basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The successful use of a water-based end seal compound by Van Camp, a division of the Ralston Purina Company, is limited
to a very specific, narrow category of food products_tuna and pet food. The Ohio can manufacturers who would be subject
to this rule produce containers for a wide variety of products, including baby food, soups and vegetables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For USEPA to assume that uniformity exists between the processes which Van Camp and Ohio can makers use to qualify end
seal compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to short change the factors which are necessary to ensure food safety and shows a considerable lack of understanding
of the delicate nature under which food is processed and packaged. CMI is concerned that USEPA is willing to risk the
safety of the American food supply in order to obtain minimal gains toward attainment of the NAAQS in Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1984 and 1985, CMI and its Ohio-based members asked OEPA to relax the VOC end seal limits because they could not use
lower solvent end seal compound with the complete certainty that food safety would be assured. If a catastrophic failure
were to occur in a single canned product which resulted in the illness or death of a consumer, the integrity of all canned
foods would be suspect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: USEPA's position on these issues has been previously stated in the response to Heekin's and Central States Can's
comments. In summary, it is agreed that add-on control has not been demonstrated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible for end seal compound application operations. However, it has not been documented that 4.4 lbs/gallon is
the most stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit that is feasible for food can end seal compounds in general. Furthermore, the CMI has not documented the effect
that food safety concerns have on using 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds. For example, if CMI's position is that 3.7
lbs/gallon end seal compound cannot be used with canned vegetables (for example) due to safety reasons, it has not
supported its position.

5. OEPA Submitted Comments on July 31, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Michael Lake report (paper) was not provided to OEPA during OEPA's public hearing on the eventual 1986 rulemaking.
Therefore, OEPA could not consider such information. Since USEPA has added that report to the docket, USEPA must show
that the report, which pertains to a specific plant in a specific food industry, is applicable to all food industries
or at least the food industries in Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If complying end sealing compounds (at the ``3.7'' level) are or will be available, OEPA asks that USEPA provide some
guidance on the proper date for compliance. The original RACT regulations, as envisioned by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA, were to require compliance by the end of 1982 with a time extension up through the end of 1985 for some can plants
where adequately justified. The Michael Lake paper shows that ``it may be feasible and cost effective to control VOC
emissions at the line with carbon adsorption or incineration'' according to USEPA. At what level of cost-effectiveness?
Does that transfer to plants in Ohio? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is OEPA's responsibility to demonstrate that 4.4 lbs/gallon is the most stringent limit that is feasible for food
can end seal compounds. OEPA provides no basis for its statement that ``U.S. EPA must show that the report, which pertains
to a specific plant in a specific food industry, is applicable to all food industries or at least the food industries
in Ohio.'' It would be appropriate for Ohio to provide adequate support for a relaxation that would make its limit the
least stringent in the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, additional time to achieve compliance with Ohio's end seal limit will only be considered by USEPA if it
is proposed and submitted by OEPA. As stated previously, USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible for this
operation. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness issue is moot.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 A. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio added paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) to establish recordkeeping requirements for those persons using
or applying cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt during the period from May 15 through September 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA proposed disapproval because these recordkeeping requirements are inadequate in that they do not apply to
the appropriate SIP period of April 15 through October 15. Although in its State regulations, Ohio currently has an
exemption period of September 15 through May 15, USEPA disapproved that extended exemption period when it was submitted
as a SIP revision. 54 FR 1934. The applicable SIP exemption period is October 15 through April 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current USEPA approved regulations, the use or application of cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt during
October 15 through April 15 is exempt from limitations. Thus, the recordkeeping requirements are necessary for the
remaining period: April 15 through October 15.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recordkeeping requirements and the September 15 through May 15 exemption period are considered adequate in light
of the USEPA Region VI's proposed approval of the Texas regulation which had a September 15 through April 15 exemption
period in a much warmer spring-fall period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) only deals with recordkeeping requirements and not when cutback asphalt
is allowed to be used. Ohio's Federally approved SIP does not allow cutback asphalt to be used from April 15 through
October 15. Unless and until the exemption period is changed (in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)), the recording requirements
must reflect the SIP requirements. Therefore, Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) should be finally disapproved.

A. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph states that the control requirements of (N)(1) and (N)(2) shall not apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the use or application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing, provided
the maximum daily usage is less than one thousand gallons 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
for any work crew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA proposed to disapprove this exemption (without the underlined words) on March 6, 1985 (and finally disapproved
this exemption on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1934)), and proposed to disapprove the rule as revised in the May 30, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This exemption is supported by a November 3, 1982, letter from the Ohio Department of Transportation which states
that ``Our attempts at using emulsified asphalt as crack sealers have not generally been satisfactory.'' The County
Engineers Association of Ohio, in a June 22, 1982, letter, requested OEPA to ``Permit use of cutback asphalt for patching
up to a usage not to exceed 2,000 gallons per day at any time of the year''. The County Engineers stated that this requested
change ``would improve the efficiency and economy of road paving and maintenance work.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language added to the end of (N)(3)(e) clarifies the exemption. However, this clarifying language could result
in substantially increased VOC emissions because it clarifies that the one thousand gallons per day refers to each
work crew. Therefore, this clarifying language, and the supporting documentation, does not change USEPA's position
on this exemption, for which an adequate basis has not been provided. USEPA informed OEPA of this in its September 17,
1985, comment letter.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The hand application exemption for crack sealers and road patching conforms to the best judgement of the engineering
staff at the Ohio Department of Transportation and the County Engineers Association of Ohio. Ohio's record in the
conversion to acceptable emulsified asphalts is above the median level of the 35 regulated States. This exemption
is certainly minor when considering this fact.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ohio's ratio of emulsified to cutback asphalt used in 1987 is not a valid basis for exempting the hand application of
cutback asphalt. This exemption is inconsistent with USEPA guidance and its previous

constitute RACT and it has provided no data on the amount of additional cutback asphalt that is used in the ozone season
as a result of the exemption.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph establishes a limitation of 4.8 lbs VOC/gallon of coating, excluding water, for a heat resistant,
anti-corrosion coating applied to the interior of a motor vehicle directly above the catalytic converter. This revision
was proposed for disapproval because it is a relaxation of approved VOC emission limits in Ohio's ozone SIP and Ohio
has not made a demonstration that this relaxation will not interfere with attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Furthermore, the July 29, 1983, memorandum titled ``Source Specific SIP Revisions''
by Sheldon Meyers, former Director of Air Quality Planning and Standards, addresses the issue of VOC SIP relaxations.
This memorandum states that approval of such a relaxation would require a data base and modeling demonstration consistent
with that applied in extension areas. The sources subject to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relaxation are located in Lordstown and Dayton, Ohio. There have not been any revised attainment demonstrations,
consistent with those done for extension areas, submitted for these areas.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The required demonstration will be made as part of the upcoming post-1987 ozone SIP submissions. USEPA is asked to
accept such commitment on the part of OEPA. Region VI has accepted such commitment for a future SIP impact assessment
at 54 FR 23672 on June 2, 1989 (regarding Vulcan Materials Company, Geismar Chemicals Plant).

5. Architectural Aluminum Coating-Rule 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The VOC requirement in this paragraph establishes a limitation of 6.2 lbs VOC/gallon of coating excluding water for
high performance architectural aluminum coatings. OEPA considers this limitation to constitute RACT. This relaxation
is supported by a September 6, 1985, letter from Reynolds Aluminum, to OEPA. This letter states that ``We have been
unable to convert our High Performance Architectural Aluminum Coatings to a low solvent formulation.'' Reynolds
attached a December 6, 1984, letter from PPG which states that its efforts to develop compliant coatings for the architectural
and recreational vehicle markets have been unsuccessful. USEPA proposed to disapprove this relaxation because
OEPA has neither documented the infeasibility of add-on control nor the potential use of powder coatings. Three of
these suppliers, Armstrong Products, Fuller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O'Brien, and Polymer Corporation, expect their coatings to pass the 5 year exposure test. Some of these are currently
in the third or fourth year of their 5-year testing period. Therefore, a permanent relaxation for high performance
architectural aluminum coatings is not approvable.

OEPA's July 31, 1989 Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA purported availability of compliant coatings for high performance architectural aluminum coatings at
3.5 lbs VOC per gallon from Armstrong Products, Fuller O'Brien, and Polymer Corporation should be documented in the
docket. If a permanent relaxation is not appropriate, does USEPA recommend a relaxation for a specific year (e.g.,
up to 1989 or 1990)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Documentation of USEPA's conversations with powder coating suppliers is in the Docket. The CTGs and Ohio SIP establish
the presumptive RACT for this source category. Ohio's comments provide no support for its proposed relaxation. USEPA
is only able to take actions on proposed SIP revisions that are submitted to it. USEPA will evaluate the merits of a compliance
date extension if submitted and supported by OEPA. Therefore, USEPA is disapproving this relaxation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OEPA had proposed a number of revisions to its RACT I, RACT II, and general VOC rules. These are contained in OAC Chapter
3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, Definitions; OAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04, Compliance and Schedules; OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09, Emission Limits;
and OAC Chapter 3745&hyph;21&hyph;10, Test Methods. A listing and short 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of all of these revisions are in USEPA's technical support documents, dated July 14, 1986, September
23, 1986, and July 27, 1988. Many of these revisions are minor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio submitted these regulations in 1986 in order to meet the RACT requirement of the pre-amended Act and USEPA reviewed
this submittal against the general RACT requirement of the preamended Act, 1977 Act &sect;172.54 FR 22915 (May 30,
1989). Since USEPA did not issue a SIP call with respect to the elements of this submittal, these revisions are not required
under the section 182(a)(2)(A) RACT fix-up requirement of the Act. However, amended section 172 retains a general
requirement that States must adopt RACT for nonattainment areas. Therefore, USEPA is taking final partial approval
action as proposed under Section 110 and Part D of the Amended Act, with the exception of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. USEPA is disapproving the proposed relaxation for food can end sealing compounds in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(D)(1)(e)
(from 3.7 to 4.4 lbs VOC/gal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. USEPA is disapproving the proposed revision to the exemption, as well as the entire exemption in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(3)(e)
for the application by hand of any cutback asphalt or emulsified asphalt for patching or crack sealing. In addition,
USEPA is disapproving the recordkeeping requirements in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(N)(4) because they are inadequate
with respect to the time period during which records are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. USEPA is disapproving the relaxation (from 3.5 to 6.2 lbs VOC/gal) for high performance architectural aluminum
coatings in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(viii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In the proposed rulemaking for this revision published at 54 FR 22915 (May 30, 1989), USEPA proposed to take no action
on the exemption for new sources in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(U)(2)(f). USEPA believes that the Amended Clean Air Act
affects this element and will repropose action on it consistent with the amended Act in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In the May 30, 1989, proposed rulemaking for this revision, USEPA proposed to disapprove the relaxation for miscellaneous
metals in 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09 (U)(1)(a)(vii). This requested rule relaxation will be reproposed in a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice because the relevant policy has changed with the Amended Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, Ohio's April 9, 1986, State submittal included new VOC regulations for additional RACT III source
categories not specifically covered by Ohio's existing rules and a site-specific revision for the Huffy Corporation.
This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document does not address these other elements of the April 9, 1986, submittal. This notice also does not address those
amendments to the ozone SIP that were previously submitted on March 28, 1983, to USEPA and for which final rulemaking
was taken on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1934). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, this action is not significant. It has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has adopted rules establishing general procedures that will apply whenever it employs a system of
competitive bidding (``auctions'') to choose from among mutually exclusive applications for certain initial licenses.
This action is taken to implement section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Procedures applicable
to specific services will be determined in future Reports and Orders. The new rules will promote the development and
rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing
in rural areas. These rules also will promote economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate licenses among
a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members
of minority groups and women. This action will provide recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public
spectrum made available for commercial use.

 In the Second Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, the Commission has amended 47 CFR part 1 to add a new Subpart
Q which contains the general rules and requirements governing the competitive bidding process for certain initial
licenses. Applicants are required to file certain information so that the Commission can determine whether the applicants
are legally, technically, and financially qualified to be licensed. Affected public are any member of the public
who wants to become a licensee. The foregoing estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the burden estimates or any
other aspect of the collection of information including suggestions for reducing the burden to the Federal Communications
Commission Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction project, Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of
the Management and Budget Paperwork reduction project, Washington, DC 20503.

Summary of Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In this Second Report and Order, we prescribe general rules and procedures to implement the Commission's new authority
under Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to use competitive bidding to award licenses for
use of the radio spectrum. In the future, in subsequent Reports and Orders, specific rules within the scope of these
general rules will be adopted for each service subject to competitive bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A voluminous number of comments and reply comments were filed by interested parties in response to the Notice of
Proposed Rule Making (58 FR 53489 (October 15, 1993)) in this docket. These comments address the many proposals made
in the Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility of License Applications for Competitive Bidding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Commission will use competitive bidding to award licenses only when the statutory criteria for auctionability
set forth in Section 309(j) of the Communications Act are met. First, there must be mutually exclusive applications
for an initial license or construction permit. Second, the service applied for must principally involve the transmission
or reception of communications services to subscribers for compensation. Applying these criteria, the Commission
determined that mutually exclusive licenses in the Interactive Video Data Service (IVDS), the Personal Communications
Services, most of the Public Mobile Services, the Multipoint Distribution Service, the Multichannel Multipoint
Distribution Service, the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, Marine Public Coast Stations and for exclusive frequencies
above 900 MHz in the Private Carrier Paging Service should be awarded through competitive bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because licensees in the Broadcast Radio and Broadcast Television Services, Maritime Operational Fixed Stations,
Personal Radio Services (except IVDS), certain Private Land Mobile Radio Services and certain other services do
not receive compensation from subscribers, these services are excluded from the competitive bidding process. The
following kinds of applications are not subject to competitive bidding: Applications for renewal of licenses, most
applications for modification, applications for subsidiary communications services, and applications for frequencies
used as intermediate links in the provision of service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Competitive Bidding Design Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. We adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions as our primary auction methodology. However, as the record convinces
us that there is no single competitive bidding design that is optimal for all auctionable services and because Congress
directed us to design and test multiple alternative methodologies, we have provided alternative methods from which
to choose under appropriate circumstances. The alternative design options are single round sealed bid auctions
(either sequential or simultaneous) and sequential oral auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The two primary characteristics that will determine the choice of auction design are: (1) The degree to which licenses
are interdependent, and (2) whether the expected license values are high or low. Because we expect most licenses to
be of high value and interdependent, the simultaneous multiple round auction is our preferred auction design. The
Commission will select the competitive bidding design to be used in auctioning particular licenses on a service-specific
basis. Combinatorial bidding, which may be used with any type of auction, is also authorized for use as a competitive
bidding mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures to Implement the Competitive Bidding Designs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. To efficiently implement the competitive bidding designs, we must specify certain auction procedures. We will
choose from these procedures and incorporate them into the service-specific rules that we will adopt in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sequencing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will choose the sequence of what is auctioned. The importance of the choice of sequence increases with the degree
of interdependence among the items auctioned in sequence. We intend to minimize the importance of the choice of sequence
by auctioning licenses sequentially only when there is not a high degree of value interdependence across the licenses
or groups that are offered in sequence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duration of bidding rounds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In simultaneous multiple round auctions, bids can be submitted continuously with the high bids announced at the
end of each round. With discrete rounds, the Commission can more readily control the pace at which the auction proceeds.
The duration of bidding rounds and the interval between rounds in simultaneous multiple round auctions may be varied
by announcement during the course of an auction. We generally intend to give bidders a single business day to submit
bids and intend to conduct a new bidding round each business day, but we may choose other round lengths and intervals
between rounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum bid increments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In multiple round auctions, whether they be sequential or simultaneous, the Commission will generally specify
minimum bid increments. The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous
round's high bid in order to be accepted as a valid bid in the current round. Imposing a minimum bid increment speeds
the progress of the auction and, along with activity and stopping rules, helps to ensure that the auction comes to closure
within a reasonable period of time. We reserve the right to specify minimum bid increments in dollar terms as well as
in percentage terms. We also may vary the minimum bid increments with respect to different licenses being awarded
in one auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stopping rules for multiple round auctions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Prior to each multiple round auction, the Commission will announce by Public Notice a stopping rule for determining
when the auction is over. We seek a stopping rule that will (1) terminate the auction in a reasonable period of time,
(2) be simple and clearly understood by participating bidders and observers of the auction process, and (3) in the
case of simultaneous auctions, close all markets at approximately the same time. In simultaneous auctions, the stopping
rules must also specify whether to close markets individually or simultaneously. Hybrid stopping rules are also
possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The following stopping rules are preferred: (1) When auctioning licenses one at a time, or simultaneously and
closing markets one at a time bidding on a market will close if a single round passes in which no new acceptable bids (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, no bids that meet any applicable bid increment rule) are submitted for that license; (2) when auctioning licenses
simultaneously and closing markets simultaneously_bidding on all markets will close if a single round passes in
which no new acceptable bids are submitted for any license.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Activity rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To ensure that simultaneous auctions with our preferred simultaneous stopping rule close within a reasonable period
of time, an activity rule is likely to be necessary to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before
participating. Where we decide to employ an activity rule, we will seek one that (1) moves auctions along at an appropriate
speed, (2) provides bidders with sufficient flexibility to pursue a wide range of alternative bidding strategies,
and (3) is simple and clearly understood by participating bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. When the Commission employs a simultaneous stopping rule, our preferred activity rule will be the three stage
rule proposed by Professors Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson. Under this rule, the minimum activity level, measured
as a fraction of the self declared maximum eligibility, would increase during the course of the auction. The auction
would be divided into three stages. During the first stage of the auction, bidders would be required to be active on
licenses encompassing at least one-third of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the second stage, bidders
would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible.
In the third stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing 100 percent of the MHz-pops for
which they are eligible. Bidders under this rule would be required to meet these activity levels to retain their desired
eligibility. A shortfall in activity would reduce eligibility levels accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The Commission retains the flexibility to choose among activity rules, other than the three stage Milgrom-Wilson
rule, on a case-by-case basis. These include: (1) A Milgrom-Wilson rule with one or two stages, (2) a rule that requires
bidders to be active on a single license, (3) a rule that requires that a bidder's activity level remain within a single
range throughout the action, (4) a rule that replaces the maximum allowed bidding levels in the Milgrom-Wilson rule
with a bidding premium for exceeding those maximums, or (5) a combination of the foregoing rules. We conclude that
a waiver procedure is necessary in conjunction with a Milgrom-Wilson activity rule. Under our preferred option,
bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers of the minimum activity requirement during the course of an auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bid withdrawal and default penalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a high bid is withdrawn prior to the close of a simultaneous round auction, the Commission will impose a penalty equal
to the difference between the withdrawn bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by
the Commission. No withdrawal penalty will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. If
a winning bidder defaults after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be required to pay the foregoing
penalty plus an additional penalty equal to three percent of the amount of the winning bid the next time the license
is offered by the Commission or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bidder's bid, whichever is less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. In the case of open outcry auctions, the Commission may choose not to impose any penalty for bid withdrawal during
the course of an auction and instead rely only on the default penalty to discourage insincere bidding. The default
penalty will be assessed if a bidder fails to make the down payment on a license, fails to pay for a license or is disqualified
after the close of an auction. In connection with single round bidding, only the basic penalty (and not the additional
three percent penalty) would generally apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Release of Bid Information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We will announce bidder identification numbers and bid amounts during the course of an auction, but not the identities
of bidders, to avoid potential manipulation and collusion among bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delay, Suspension or Cancellation of Auction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By Public Notice or by announcement during an auction, the Commission may delay, suspend or cancel an auction in the
event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of auction security breach, unlawful bidding activity,
administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects the fair and competitive conduct of the competitive
bidding. In such cases, the Commission may, at its sole discretion, resume the auction starting from the beginning
of the current or some previous round or may cancel the auction in its entirety.

Pre-Auction Procedures and Bidder and License Qualification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. To streamline the processing of auction applications and ensure that bidders and licensees are qualified, we
are adopting the following procedures. Usually, no less than 75 days before each scheduled auction, the Commission
will release a Public Notice announcing the auction. The initial Public Notice will normally contain information
such as the licenses to be auctioned and the time, place and method of competitive bidding to be used, including applicable
bid withdrawal procedures and penalties, stopping rules and activity rules.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. The initial Public Notice will also specify filing windows for short-form applications (no long form applications
are to be filed at this stage of the competitive bidding application procedure) and bidder certifications, filing
fees, upfront and down payments. Applications filed before or after the dates specified in the Public Notice will
not be accepted by the Commission. Applications submitted after the deadline specified will be dismissed with prejudice.
An auction information package will be made available to prospective bidders after the release of the initial Public
Notice. Slightly different procedures will apply when the rules permit applicants to submit long form applications
after the occurrence or nonoccurrence of certain events (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
passage of time and failure to serve a particular area).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The short-form applications and bidder certifications will normally require applicants to provide the following
information: (1) The license(s) for which the applicant wishes to bid, (2) the applicant's name, (3) the identity
of the person(s) authorized to bid, (4) certifications that the applicant is legally, technically, financially,
and otherwise qualified, and (5) certification that the applicant satisfies any financial qualification  requirements
for the service in question. Applicants seeking to file as designated entities eligible for bidding preferences
must indicate their status in the short-form application and must certify that they are qualified to file  as designated
entities. Bidders will also be required to identify all parties with whom they have entered into partnerships, joint
ventures, consortium, or other arrangements or agreements. Bidders will also be required to certify on their short-form
applications that they have not entered into any explicit or implicit agreements with any parties other than those
identified regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular properties on which they will
or will not bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. After reviewing the short-form applications, the Commission will issue a Public Notice listing all defective
applications and notify applicants of the specific defect. If the Commission receives only one application that
is acceptable for filing for a particular license, the Commission will issue a Public Notice cancelling the auction
for this license and establishing a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which would trigger
the relevant procedures permitting petitions to deny. Applicants whose short-form applications are substantially
complete but have minor errors or defects will be provided an opportunity to correct their applications prior to the
auction. However, applicants will not be permitted to make any major modifications to their applications, including
ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia. Also, applications that are
not signed or that fail to make the requisite certifications will be dismissed as unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release another Public Notice announcing the
names of all applicants whose applications have been accepted for filing. Applicants identified in the Public Notice
will then be required to submit the full amount of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date
to be specified in that Public Notice which generally will be no later than 14 days before the scheduled auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Once the Commission has received from the lock-box bank the names of all applicants who have submitted timely unfront
payments, the Commission will issue a fourth Public Notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined
to be qualified to bid. Each of these applicants will be provided a bidder identification number and further information
and instructions regarding the auction procedures.

Competitive Bidding Payments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Upfront Payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most cases, some form of upfront payment is necessary to deter frivolous or insincere bidding. We have determined
that the best approach is to retain flexibility to determine the amount of upfront payment on an auction-by-auction
basis. Generally, a bidder must submit an upfront payment equal to $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination
of MHz-pops the bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding. A bidder may file applications for every
license being auctioned, but its actual bidding in any round of an auction will be limited by the amount of its upfront
payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Upfront payments will provide the Commission with a source of available funds in the event a penalty must be assessed
for bid withdrawal prior to further payments. In future Reports and Orders establishing service-specific auction
rules, we may determine that the $0.02 per pop per MHz formula is inappropriate because of product market or license
characteristics or auction design choice. In some circumstances, we may decide that it is more appropriate instead
to set a fixed upfront payment or eliminate the upfront payment. We therefore reserve the option of revising or waiving
the upfront payment. In such cases, we will adopt an alternative upfront payment in service-specific auction rules
or in the Public Notice announcing the auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. As a general rule, we will not cap upfront payments because we need to ensure that those bidding on large numbers
of licenses have the financial capability to build out those licenses and are bidding in good faith. However, we reserve
the right to institute caps in specific services if we are satisfied that an absolute dollar amount will provide sufficient
deterrence against frivolous bidding and pernicious strategic bidding. Setting a minimum upfront payment may be
appropriate when use of our preferred formula would result in a payment that would be too small. Although a general
minimum upfront payment of $2,500 is reasonable, we retain the flexibility to modify this amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. As a general matter, to protect the integrity of the auction process, all applicants should be required to tender
their upfront payments to the Commission prior to bidding. However, given the likely magnitude of some upfront payments
and the fact that there will be a significant interval between the date that short-form applications are filed and
the auction date, we will not require the filing of upfront payments with short-form applications. Upfront payments
will be required to be made to the Commission on a date to be announced by Public Notice, generally no later than 14 days
before the scheduled auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Down Payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 20 percent down payment is appropriate to ensure that auction winners have the necessary financial capabilities
to complete payment for the license and to pay for the costs of constructing a system and protect against possible default,
while at the same time not being so onerous as to hinder growth and diminish access. We therefore will require that winning
bidders supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to being their total deposits up to 20 percent
of their winning bid(s). The down payment by cashier's check or wire transfer to our lock-box will generally be required
within five business days after the auction is over.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remainder of License Payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will not permit licensees to satisfy their payment obligations to the Commission through the payment
of royalties. With the exception of certain designated entities, we are requiring full payment of the remainder of
the winning bid in a lump sum. This will leave financing to the private sector and eliminate the need for the Commission
to conduct detailed credit checks.

Default and Disqualification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is critically important to the success of our system of competitive bidding that potential bidders understand
that there will be a substantial penalty assessed if they withdraw a high bid, are found not to be qualified to hold licenses,
or default on a balance due. We will require any auction winner who defaults by failing to remit the required down payment
within the prescribed time to reimburse the Commission in the amount of the difference between its high bid and the
amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. A defaulting auction winner will also be assessed a penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the
subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the three percent penalty will be calculated
based on the defaulting bid's amount. This additional penalty will also apply if an auction winner is disqualified
or fails to remit the balance of its winning bid after having made the required down payment. We will hold deposits made
by defaulting or disqualified auction winners to help ensure that the penalty is paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
34. If a default or disqualification involves gross misconduct, misrepresentation, or bad faith by an applicant,
the Commission also may declare the applicant and its principals ineligible to bid in future auctions, and may take
any other action that it may deem necessary. Where specific instances of collusion in the competitive bidding process
are alleged during the petition to deny process, the Commission may conduct an investigation or refer such complaints
to the United States Department of Justice for investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. If the high bidder makes the down payment in a timely manner, a long-form application will be required to be filed
by a specified date, generally within ten business days after the close of the auction. The Commission will then review
the long-form application to determine if it is acceptable for filing. Upon acceptance for filing, the Commission
will release a Pubic Notice announcing acceptance for filing of the long-form application thus triggering the filing
window for petitions to deny.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. The long-form application must include as an exhibit a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties
involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement they have entered into relating
to the competitive bidding process prior to the close of bidding. All such arrangements must have been entered into
prior to the filing of the short-form application. If all petitions to deny are dismissed or denied, the Commission
is satisfied that the applicant is qualified, the license(s) will be granted to the auction winner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. The Commission need not conduct a hearing before denial if it determines that an applicant is not qualified and
no substantial issue of fact exists concerning that determination. In the event that the Commission identifies substantial
and material issues of fact in need of resolution, Sections 309 (j)(5) and (i)(2) of the Communications Act permit
in any hearing the submission of all or part of evidence in written form and allows employees other than administrative
law judges to preside at the taking of written evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. As a general rule, when an auction winner defaults on its final payment or is otherwise disqualified after having
made the required down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license. Nevertheless, if a default
occurs within five business days after the end of bidding, the Commission retains the right to offer the license to
the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer the license to other
bidders at their final bid levels. If a new auction becomes necessary because of a disqualification or default more
than five business days after the end of bidding, we will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications to
assure that serious interested bidders are in the pool of qualified bidders at any re-auction.

Reservation Prices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We will retain the flexibility to utilize a reservation price below which a license would not be awarded if we decide
that it is appropriate in a particular auction. The reservation price could be disclosed, in which case it would effectively
constitute a minimum bid, or it could be undisclosed.

40. We will impose a transfer disclosure requirement on licenses obtained through the competitive bidding process,
whether by  a designated entity or not. We will give particular scrutiny to action winners who have not yet begun commercial
service and who seek approval for a transfer of control or assignment of their licenses within three years after the
initial license grant, in order to determine if any unforeseen problems relating to unjust enrichment have arisen
outside the designated entity context. The applicant will be required to file, together with its application, the
associated contracts for sale, option agreements and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received
in return for the transfer of its license

41. We believe that it is unnecessary and undesirable to impose performance requirements on all auctionable services
in excess of those set forth in service rules for most existing services. We do not believe that additional, general
requirements are needed to address concerns over ``warehousing'' of spectrum. With respect to those services where
no performance requirements currently exist, however, we will prescribe such performance rules as are necessary
at the same time we promulgate competitive bidding rules for each of those services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are adopting a menu of preferences from which we will choose in service-specific auction rules. These preferences
are designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women (collectively ``designated entities'') are given the opportunity to participate in both the competitive
bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. To qualify as a ``small business'' for the purposes
of competitive bidding, an entity must be an independently-owned business with a net worth not exceeding $6 million
dollars and an average net income after Federal income taxes for two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. In
order to be eligible for preferences, businesses owned by women or minorities will be required to have at least 50.1
percent equity ownership and a 50.1 percent controlling interest owned by women or minorities. Rural telephone companies
will be eligible for preferences if they are independently owned, have 50,000 access lines or fewer and serve communities
with no more than 10,000 inhabitants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Installment payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We may allow small businesses (including rural telephone companies and businesses owned by women and minorities
and rural telephone companies) that are winning bidders for certain blocks of spectrum to pay in installments over
the term of their licenses. As a general matter, we will only allow installment payments for licenses in those smaller
spectrum blocks that are most likely to match the business objectives of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
small businesses. The down payment for such designated entities will be 10 percent of the winning bid instead of 20
percent. Once the license is granted we will require that the remaining 10 percent of the down payment be made within
five business days of grant, thereby commencing the eligible entity's installment payment plan, which will extend
over the period of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. We will impose interest of installment payments equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations of maturity equal
to the license term. The schedule of installment payments will begin with interest-only payments for the first two
years. After that, principal and interest will be amortized over the remaining term of the license. An eligible designated
entity that elects installment payments will have its license conditioned upon the full and timely performance of
its payment obligations under the installment plan. However, we will consider (on a case-by-case basis) a grace period
before a delinquent payor's license cancels.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bidding credits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bidding credits (payment discounts) may be available to designated entities on certain frequency blocks. Competitive
bidding rules applicable to individual services will specify the designated entities eligible for bidding credits,
the licenses for which bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other procedures. We reserve
the option to determine, on a service-specific basis, whether certain auctionable services should allow other bidding
credits to a consortium of companies organized to bid for auctionable services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46. To further promote the investment and rapid deployment of new technologies and services in rural areas, we will
also institute a system of bidding credits for rural telephone companies for licenses in their rural service areas.
The amount of the bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be tied to their commitments to achieve certain
telecommunications infrastructure build-out milestones in their rural service areas. The amount of the bidding
credit will be proportionately linked to the amount by which the rural telephone company agrees to expand its built-out
commitment. Failure to meet a build-out commitment will result in liability for a penalty in the amount of the bidding
credit, plus interest. Grant of licenses to rural telephone companies utilizing bidding credits will be conditioned
upon payment of this penalty, if and when it becomes applicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Set-aside spectrum. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We may establish set-aside spectrum in certain services in which eligibility to bid may be limited to some or all designated
entities. For any auctions of set-aside spectrum, we anticipate that we will establish lower upfront payments. This
lower payment would serve to encourage participation by all eligible designated entities in the auction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tax certificates, distress sales and royalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will not at this time adopt a general tax certificate program for services subject to competitive bidding because
other available measures will generally provide sufficient incentive to attract investors in designated entity
enterprises. We will examine the feasibility of utilizing tax certificates in subsequent competitive bidding rules
for particular services, especially where the record demonstrates a need to further stimulate designated entity
participation in spectrum auctions and in the after-market for auctioned services. Before we determine whether
distress sales to designated entities should be authorized, we will evaluate the success of our other measures. We
do not adopt royalties as an alternative payment method for designated entities. Such a procedure would prove extremely
intrusive and difficult to implement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preventing unjust enrichment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If we employ set-asides to benefit some or all of the designated entities, we will impose a recapture provision, applicable
in the event of a sale to a non-designated entity, that would be designed to recoup for the government a portion of the
value of the benefit received by the designated entity in the bidding. Such a recapture provision would require that
licensees seeking to transfer their licenses for profit must within a specified time remit to the government a penalty
equal to a portion of the total value of the benefit conferred by the government. We will generally reduce the penalty
as time passes or construction benchmarks are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50. Any specific recapture provisions will be set forth in competitive bidding rules applicable to any services in
which we decide to set aside licenses. In no event will recapture provisions apply to the transfer or assignment of
a license that has been held for more than five years. If the transfer is made to another eligible designated entity,
there would be no penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51. If a small business making installment payments sells its license to an entity that does not qualify under the standards
we have set for small businesses, we will require payment of the full amount of the remaining principal balance as a
condition of the license transfer. Also, where bidding credits are used, transfer of a license to a non-designated
entity or any action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity,
will require the designated entity to reimburse the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest.

52. This rulemaking proceeding was initiated to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended.
The rules adopted herein will carry out Congress's intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for choosing
from among mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum principally
for the transmission or reception of communications signals to or from subscribers for compensation. The rules adopted
herein also will carry out Congress's intent to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.

instances that applications for modification that are mutually exclusive with other applications should be subject
to competitive bidding;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applications for subsidiary communications services. A ``subsidiary communications service'' is a class of
service where the signal for that service is indivisible from that of the main channel signal and that main channel
signal is exempt from competitive bidding under other provisions of these rules. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;1.2102(c) (exempting broadcast services). Examples of such subsidiary communications services are those
transmitted on subcarriers within the FM baseband signal (see 47 CFR 73.295), and signals transmitted within the
Vertical Blanking Interval of a broadcast television signal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Applications for frequencies used as an intermediate link or links in the provision of a continuous, end-to-end
service were no service is provided directly to subscribers over the frequencies. Examples of such intermediate
links are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Point-to-point microwave facilities used to connect a cellular radio telephone base station with a cellular
radio telephone mobile telephone switching office; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Point-to-point microwave facilities used as part of the service offering in the provision of telephone exchange
or interexchange service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Applications in the following services or classes of services are not subject to competitive bidding:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Alaska-Private Fixed Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, subpart O); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Broadcast radio (AM and FM) and broadcast television (VHF, UHF, LPTV) under 47 CFR part 73;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Broadcast Auxiliary and Cable Television Relay Services (see 47 CFR part 74, subparts D, E, F, G, H and L and part
78, subpart B);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Competitive bidding design options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or
classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The Commission will choose from one or more of the following types
of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to competitive bidding:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sequential oral auctions; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be
used with any type of auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;1.2103,
the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default
on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be
subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the
license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing
bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close
of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (g)(1) of this section plus an
additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid
amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified
bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify
the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that such
penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bidder identification during auctions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During any auction, the Commission may identify bidders and the bids only by bid numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle,
evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that
affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole
discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or
cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form application (FCC Form 175), together with
any appropriate filing fee set forth in public notice. Unless otherwise provided by Public Notice, the Form 175 need
not be accompanied by an upfront payment (see &sect;1.2106).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All Form 175s will be due:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) On the date(s) specified by public notice; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur automatically by operation of law (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 22.902), on a date specified by public notice after the Commission has reviewed the applications that have been
filed on those dates and determined that mutual exclusivity exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Form 175 must contain the following information:

but not limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, identifying all parties with whom the applicant

Modification and Dismissal of Form 175.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Any Form 175 that is not signed or otherwise does not contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this
section is unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected subsequent to any applicable filing deadline. The application
will be dismissed with prejudice and the upfront payment, if paid, will be returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein (except for failure
to sign the application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected application. Form 175 may be amended
or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the application (such as typographical errors). The Commission
will classify all amendments as major or minor, pursuant to rules applicable to specific services. An application
will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after
applicable filing deadlines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applicant who fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by public notice will
have their applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the filing of short-form applications, all bidders are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing
or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies with other bidders until after the high
bidder makes the required down payment, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding
arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application.

Submission of upfront payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment.
In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice.
No interest will be paid on upfront payments. In auctions for licenses set aside pursuant to &sect;1.2110(c), the
Commission may establish lower upfront payments for eligible designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial
institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the
Federal Communications Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rules, or if insufficient funds are tendered to
constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring
it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum
upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made
will be returned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder
is the high bidder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to
&sect;1.2104 for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will
be used to satisfy the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional payment obligations
that the high bidder may have.

Submission of Down Payment and Filing of Long-Form Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder
must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring
its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its
high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under &sect;1.2103, however, bidders may be required
to submit their down payments with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn
in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated
entities eligible for installment payments under &sect;1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits
up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent
down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. See &sect;1.2110(e) (1) and (2). Down payments
will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has been awarded the license and has paid the remaining balance
due on the license, in which case it will not be returned, or until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee
or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned, less applicable penalties. No interest will be paid on any down
payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after
being notified that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-form application'') pursuant
to the rules governing the service in which the applicant is the high bidder (unless it has already submitted such an
application, as contemplated by &sect;1.2105(a)(1)(b). For example, if the applicant is a high bidder for a license
in the Interactive Video Data Service (see 47 CFR part 95, subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on
FCC Form 574 in accordance with Section 95.815 of the Rules. Notwithstanding any other provision in title 47 of the
Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with
their long-form applications. Notwithstanding any other provision in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations
to the contrary, the high bidder's long-form application must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office of the Secretary,
Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., room 222, Washington, DC 20554, Attention: Auction Application
Processing Section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form application as required under this subsection, and fails
to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject to the
penalties set forth in &sect;1.2104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must provide a detailed explanation of the terms and
conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement or arrangement
it had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to &sect;1.2105.

Procedures for filing petitions to deny against long-form applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act or the Commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific
procedures for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the Commission's Rules, the procedures
in this section shall apply to the filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice that a long-form application has been accepted
for filing, petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations
of fact or denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The
times for filing such opposition and replies will be those provided in &sect;1.45.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the Commission determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and material issue of fact concerning that determination,
it will grant the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial issue of fact concerning that determination, the
Commission need not hold an evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit
all or part of the evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other than administrative law judges
to preside at the taking of written evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are required to pay the balance of their winning bids
in a lump sum within five (5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned
on full and timely payment of the winning bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has declared competitive bidding closed or fails to
remit the required down payment within five (5) business days after the Commission has declared competitive bidding
closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the
default penalty specified in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission may either re-auction the license
to existing or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. The
down payment obligations set forth in &sect;1.2107(b) will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the required down payment, will be deemed to
have defaulted and will be liable for the penalty set forth in &sect;1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission will
conduct another auction for the license, affording new parties an opportunity to file applications for the license.

(b) Definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Small businesses. Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific services, a small business is an entity
that, together with its affiliates, has no more than a $6 million net worth and, after federal income taxes (excluding
any carry over losses), has no more than $2 million in annual profits each year for the previous two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women. A business owned by members of minority groups and/or
women is one in which minorities and/or women who are U.S. citizens have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and
50.1 percent controlling interest in the applicant. For applicants that are limited partnerships, the general partner
either must be a minority and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who is a U.S. citizen and owns at least 50.1 percent
of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women who are
U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements such
as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control an
entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration
that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority and female principals
of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity, a designated
entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated
on a fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American
Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asian American extraction.

(d) The Commission may permit small businesses, including small businesses owned by women and minorities and rural
telephone companies that qualify as small businesses, that are high bidders for licenses specified by the Commission,
to pay the full amount of their high bids in installments over the term of their licenses pursuant to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Unless otherwise specified, each eligible applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit
by wire transfer or cashier's check in the manner specified in &sect;1.2107(b) sufficient additional funds as are
necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after
the Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit the required payment will
make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to &sect;1.2104(g)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within five (5) business days of the grant of the license application of a winning bidder eligible for installment
payments, the licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby commencing the eligible licensee's
installment payment plan. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant
to &sect;1.2104(g)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment

(ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more installment payments, a licensee may request that the
Commission permit a three to six month grace period, during which no installment payments need be made. In considering
whether to grant a request for a grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the licensee's payment
history, including whether the licensee has defaulted before, how far into the license term the default occurs, the
reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction build-out requirements, the licensee's financial
condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under an authorized distress sale policy. If the Commission
grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a restructured payment schedule, interest will continue
to accrue and will be amortized over the remaining term of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace
period request, or upon default with no such request submitted, the license will automatically cancel and the Commission
will initiate debt collection procedures pursuant to subpart O of this part.

for bidding credits, the licenses for which bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be available only for licenses in rural telephone company
service areas and only if eligible rural telephone companies make an infrastructure build-out commitment beyond
any standard performance requirement. The amount of the bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be based
on the amount by which eligible applicants agree to expand or accelerate the build-out commitment. If a rural telephone
company fails to meet an accelerated or expanded build-out commitment, it must make payment to the Commission within
ninety (90) days of a penalty equal to the amount of the bidding credit. Grant of the license will be conditioned upon
payment of this penalty if and when it becomes applicable.

with its application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the Commission a statement indicating that
its license was obtained through competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission the associated
contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the total consideration
that the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license. This information should
include not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-kind, or other consideration (

As specified in this paragraph (b), an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise
permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor pursuant to a set-aside
for eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(c), or who proposes to take any other action relating to ownership
or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission approval and may
be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Commission by cashier's check or wire transfer before
consent will be granted. The Payment will be based upon a schedule that will take account of the term of the license,
any applicable construction benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-aside benefit, which will be calculated
as the difference between the amount paid by the designated entity for the license and the value of a comparable non-set-aside
license in the free market at the time of the auction. The Commission will establish the amount of the Payment and the
burden will be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No Payment will be required if:

financing available to designated entities under &sect;1.2110(d) will be required to pay the full amount of the remaining
principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. No payment will be required if the proposed transferee or
assignee assumes the installment payment obligations of the transferor or assignor, and if the proposed transferee
or assignee is itself qualified to obtain installment financing under &sect;1.2110(d), and so certifies.

credits available to eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(e), or who proposes to take any other action
relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission
approval and will be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Government by wire transfer or
cashier's check before consent will be granted. The Payment will be the sum of the amount of the bidding credit plus
interest at the rate applicable for installment financing in effect at the time the license was awarded. See &sect;1.2110(e).

By this Supplemental Order, the Commission affirms its decision to adopt the Motorola C-Quam system as the standard
for the stereophonic AM broadcast radio service. On November 23, 1993, the Commission released a Report and Order
implementing the C-Quam AM stereo standard. Subsequent to the release on the Report and Order, it has come to the attention
of the Commission that a number of comments had been inadvertently overlooked. After review of these additional comments,
the Commission finds no new evidence or information that warrants a change in its decision in this matter.

Summary of the Order

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In response to the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 (Authorization Act), the Commission adopted
a Report and Order in this proceeding, 58 FR 66300, December 20, 1993, selecting the C-Quam system as the single AM stereo
transmission standard.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequent to the release of the Report and Order, it was found that twenty comments had inadvertently not been considered.
Most of these comments were improperly or untimely filed. Nevertheless, because other late and improperly filed
comments were considered in the Report and Order, we have elected to consider all of these comments at this time.

2. All of the previously unconsidered comments oppose the Commission's proposed selection of C-Quam as the AM stereo
standard. Most parties generally allege some form of technical superiority of the Kahn system, or conversely, some
technical inferiority of the C-Quam system. Specifically, these parties claim the C-Quam system exhibits technical
flaws, including ``platform motion,'' loss of coverage, and increased adjacent channel interference.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, some commenting parties recommend that additional testing or evaluation be undertaken. Other parties
question the compatibility of C-Quan with future AM band digital audio transmission systems, argue that adopting
a system other than Kahn's as the standard will force them to re-engineer antenna array, or contend that Motorola unfairly
manipulated the marketplace to create its competitive lead.

3. The relative technical performance of the Kahn and C-Quam systems was addressed in the Report and Order, including
specifically the issues of platform motion, coverage area and adjacent channel performance. With regard to platform
motion, we concluded that recent improvements in receiver design mitigate such effects. Modern C-Quam receivers
compensate for platform motion by gradually reducing stereo channel separation as signal-to-noise ratios deteriorate,
creating a smooth transition to monaural operation when signals are weak. Further, as previously noted, such weak
signal effects as platform motion generally occur beyond a station's protected coverage area. Claims of loss of coverage
area and increased adjacent channel interference with C-Quam appear to be based on allegations that the C-Quam signal
must be modulated at lower levels to avoid excessive bandwidth. As stated in the Report and Order, we find no evidence
that currently authorized C-Quam equipment violates the Commission's bandwidth requirements when operated properly.
The additional commenting parties present no new analysis or measurements to support their claims. We further note
that the record contains no complaints of lost coverage from the hundreds of broadcasters currently using the C-Quam
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. With regard to suggestions that further testing and evaluation should be performed, in the Report and Order we noted
that the Motorola and Kahn systems have been tested and comparatively evaluated over the years, and both systems were
found to have technical advantages. As stated, we have no reason to expect that further testing would reveal any new
information. Moreover, any further testing would lead to additional delays and would be inconsistent with the statutory
time restrictions on this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The issue of compatibility with future AM band digital audio broadcast systems was also discussed in the Report
and Order. We noted that there is no reason to believe that either the C-Quam system or the Kahn system would have any
advantage in compatibility with future digital systems. We further observed that, as we have no specific information
on the likely design of such systems, we would not presuppose to consider fairly issues relating to their compatibility
with AM stereo technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. With regard to comments that protest the potential costs associated with re-engineering the antenna arrays to
accommodate C-Quam transmission, we observe that conversion of any station to any AM stereo system, either initially
or from one system to another, will certainly involve re-engineering costs. Commenting parties have not provided
any evidence from which to conclude that the conversion cost to the relatively few stations using the Kahn system outweigh
the benefits to the public of requiring use of the C-Quam system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. We stated in the Report and Order that we were not persuaded that Motorola unfairly manipulated the market to deny
any segment of the industry or the public a free choice. No new information in the additional comments convinces us
otherwise. While vehicular receivers for any system other than C-Quam may indeed be generally unavailable, this
is a result of market choices by vehicle and receiver manufacturers in anticipating the preference of their customers.
We disagree that existing market penetration is inadequate to determine whether a de facto standard exists. As stated
in the Report and Order, we find that there was indeed sufficient convergence in the market place toward C-Quam during
the past twelve years of unrestricted competition between the systems to conclude that the public interest would
be best served by adopting C-Quam as the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. With regard to the comments that the Commission should mandate multiple system receivers, allow systems other
than the standard to be operated on a non-interference basis, or not adopt a standard, we find these positions to be
inconsistent with the Congressional mandate in this matter. Specifically, the Authorization Act requires that
we select a single standard for AM stereo.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In the Report and Order, we determined that stations employing power-side operation are not subject to the provisions
of the stereophonic transmission standard and use of the Kahn system for such operation could continue. Thus, we believe
that the decision made in the Report and Order is responsive to those parties wishing to use the Kahn system for power-side
operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. We remain convinced that the Motorola C-Quam system is the appropriate choice for the AM stereo standard. We find
no arguments in any of the previously unconsidered comments that persuade us to modify any of the decisions previously
adopted in the Report and Order.

On reconsideration, the Commission grants the request of K to Z, Ltd., licensee of Station WGLR-FM, Channel 249A,
Lancaster, Wisconsin, to substitute Channel 249C3 in lieu of Channel 249A at Lancaster, rather than Channel 234C3
allotted to Manchester, Iowa in the Report and Order, 56 FR 56,472, published November 5, 1991, and to modify the license
of Station WGLR-FM accordingly. The Commission substitutes Channel 234A in lieu of Channel 249A at Clinton, Iowa
for Station KCLN (FM), and modifies Station KCLN (FM)'s license accordingly. The Commission also substitutes Channel
274A in lieu of Channel 236A at Morrison, Illinois for Station WZZT (FM), and modifies Station WZZT (FM)'s license
accordingly. The Commission also rescinds both the substitution of Channel 234C3 at Manchester, Iowa and the modification
of Station KMCH's license to reflect that substitution. With this action, the proceeding is terminated. See Supplemental

 This final rule delays until September 1, 1994, the effective date of the requirements in one section of a final rule
issued November 2, 1992, which amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 217, Bus Emergency Exits and Window
Retention and Release, to revise the minimum requirements for school bus emergency exits and improve access to school
bus emergency doors. On March 24, 1994, NHTSA issued an interpretation of the term ``daylight opening'' used in the
final rule. Subsequently, NHTSA has learned that several school bus manufacturers had misunderstood this term and
as a result, will not have designed many of their buses with sufficient exits to comply with the new requirement by the
May 2, 1994 effective date. Because NHTSA agrees that this term could have been misunderstood, NHTSA is allowing manufacturers
to continue certifying their buses as having the exits required prior to the November 2, 1992 final rule until September
1, 1994. All other requirements of the November 2, 1992 final rule will continue to be effective on May 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 15, 1991, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend Standard No. 217 to require
that the minimum number of emergency exits on school buses be based upon the seating capacity of the school bus (56 FR
11153). Under the proposal, all school buses would have been required to have either a rear emergency exit door or a
side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window. Depending on capacity, some school buses would have been required
to have additional exits. The NPRM proposed two options regarding the means for providing the additional emergency
exits. Option A would have required the use of emergency exit doors. Option B would have required a combination of emergency
exit doors and emergency roof exits. The NPRM included a table indicating the additional exits required under each
option for any bus with a designated seating capacity between 24 and 90. The determination of the number and type of
exits used in the tables was based on crediting an emergency exit door with its minimum area (24 inches &times; 45 inches,
or 1,080 inches2) and crediting two emergency roof exits as a single emergency exit door. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule increasing the amount of emergency exit area required on school buses
(57 FR 49413). As in the proposal, the final rule required that the minimum emergency exit area on school buses be based
upon the seating capacity of the school bus. However, the final rule differed from the NPRM concerning the calculation
by which the need for additional emergency exits was to be determined. (On December 2, 1992 NHTSA published a technical
amendment to the November 2, 1992 final rule. Both of these notices will be referred to collectively as the November
2, 1992 final rule.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 2, 1992 final rule specified that after calculating the total amount of additional emergency exit area
[AEEA] needed for a school bus, using the formula proposed in the NPRM, each exit was to be credited with its ``daylight
opening.'' ``Daylight opening'' was defined as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit when viewed
from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' The preamble to the final rule did not include a further
discussion of what might constitute an obstruction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 8, 1994, Mr. Bob Carver of Wayne Wheeled Vehicles (Wayne) wrote to the agency requesting clarification
of the terms ``daylight opening'' and ``unobstructed opening.'' The Wayne letter included Figure 5C from the November
2, 1992 final rule. This figure illustrates the permitted placement of a seat adjacent to a side emergency exit door.
Wayne stated that agency personnel had indicated that only the area visually obstructed by the seat could not be credited,
and requested confirmation of this interpretation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency's response, dated March 24, 1994, did not agree with this interpretation. The March 24 letter states, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``daylight opening'' is defined in the Final Rule as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit
when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' An obstruction in this context would include
any obstacle or object that would block, obscure, or interfere with, in any way, access to that exit when opened. In
determining the ``maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit,'' we would subtract, from the total area of
the opening, the area of any portions of the opening that cannot be used for exit purposes as a result of the obstruction.
The area measurements would be taken when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the particular illustration included with the Wayne letter, the March 24 letter states that the area
forward of the seat back and leg would be considered obstructed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 20, 1994, Mr. Thomas D. Turner of Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) wrote to the agency regarding the March
24 letter. The Blue Bird letter states, ``(w)e believed and were told (by agency personnel) that the definition of
`daylight opening' applied to the exit opening itself and did not involve access to the exit opening.'' The Blue Bird
letter also notes that additional interpretations will be needed to address obstructions at rear emergency exit
doors, emergency exit windows, and the front service door. Blue Bird requested that the agency suspend enforcement
until either (1) a final rule is issued in connection with a December 1, 1993 NPRM which proposed two alternative means
of determining the maximum credit of emergency exits or (2) September 1, 1994. Blue Bird stated that this would allow
sufficient time to resolve these issues and make any necessary changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, Mr. Turner met with agency to further explain the scope of the problem for Blue Bird. In this meeting,
Mr. Turner explained that the confusion resulted in part because the term ``daylight opening'' is used differently
from the November 2 final rule definition in other contexts. The alternate definition is consistent with Blue Bird's
understanding of the term prior to the March 24, 1994 letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 27, 1994, Ms. Jane L. Dawson of Thomas Built Buses (Thomas Built) wrote to the agency to request a delay of the
effective date of the November 2, 1992 final rule. Thomas Built stated that the March 24, 1994 letter ``differs drastically
from the general interpretation of the school bus industry.'' Thomas Built also stated that one effect of the March
24 letter was the need for additional interpretations regarding other emergency exits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interpreting the term ``daylight opening'' either as any area not visually obstructed or as the entire area of the
exit opening, results in crediting some exits with more exit area than the agency intended. On some buses, this would
result in an incorrect determination that either no additional exits or fewer additional exits are required. For
example, if a rear emergency exit door is credited with greater area than allowed, a manufacturer may have determined
that no additional exits were required. On other buses, the manufacturer may have determined that only an additional
side emergency exit door was required. However, if the required exits and the additional side emergency exit door
are credited with greater area than allowed, this determination would be incorrect and an additional emergency roof
exit may also be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that the term ``daylight opening,'' without clarifying explanation, is arguably ambiguous,
in that it leaves open the question of whether an ``obstruction'' is a visual obstruction or a physical obstruction.
This is the issue resolved by the agency's March 24, 1994 letter to Wayne. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than penalize manufacturers that utilized the alternative interpretation, at significant cost to them,
NHTSA has decided to allow manufacturers the option of complying with the previous requirements regarding the number
and type of exits required for a school bus until September 1, 1994. That is, until September 1, 1994, manufacturers
can install either a rear emergency exit door or a side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to Blue Bird's request to suspend enforcement until a final rule is issued for the December 1, 1993, NPRM,
NHTSA has determined that such a delay is not warranted. Each of the options proposed in the December 1, 1993 NPRM would
further limit the amount of area that can be credited for an emergency exit. Because any final rule consistent with
the proposals in the December 1, 1993 NPRM would require vehicle redesign, additional leadtime would be necessary
after publication of such a final rule. Therefore, NHTSA has determined that suspension of the November 2, 1992 final
rule until the rulemaking proceeding for the December 1, 1993 NPRM is final would unnecessarily delay the safety benefits
of the November 2, 1992 final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that the safety effects of an extension to September 1, 1994 will be minimal. The November 2, 1992 final
rule required additional exits on some school buses. The confusion about the amount of area credited for each exit
has resulted in some school buses having fewer exits than the agency expected under the November 2, 1992 final rule.
However, many of these school buses have been redesigned to have more exits than required prior to the November 2, 1992
final rule. The agency expects that manufacturers will not revert to prior designs during the extension period. Therefore,
much of the anticipated benefits of the final rule will be retained during this time period. In addition, the length
of the extension period is short. Therefore, NHTSA anticipates minimal loss of safety benefits as a result of this
extension.

By contrast, the economic effects of denying manufacturers' requests to delay the effective date would be significant.
Most of the school buses which are currently being manufactured or which will be manufactured during the extension
period have already been ordered. Because it is common practice to order school buses by competitive bidding, manufacturers
will have to sell these school buses at the price quoted when ordered. If a manufacturer based the price on installing
fewer exits than required to comply with Standard No. 217, the manufacturer would have to absorb the cost. In addition,
if an extension were not granted, manufacturers would have to stop production until changes could be made to designs,
which could take several months.

NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning

regulatory policies and procedures. As explained above, this notice merely extends the effective date of the final
rule of November 2, 1992, which amended Standard 217. There will be no additional costs associated with this final
rule. Rather, this final rule extends the date of compliance with the amendments of Standard 217 to September 1, 1994.

This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State
may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the
Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies
only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS establishes fishery management measures for the ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California
for 1994. Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and area. The measures establish fishing areas, seasons,
quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum
lengths for salmon taken in the exclusive economic zone (3&hyph;200 nautical miles) off Washington, Oregon, and
California. These management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably
among non-treaty commercial and recreational and treaty Indian fisheries. The regulations also are calculated
to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries.
This action also announces a technical amendment codifying the spawning escapement goal for Klamath Fall chinook.
NMFS also announces 1995 recreational salmon seasons opening earlier than May 1, 1995.

The ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under a ``framework'' fishery management
plan (FMP). The framework FMP was approved in 1984 and has been amended five times since then (52 FR 4146, February 10,
1987; 53 FR 30285, August 11, 1988; 54 FR 19185, May 4, 1989; 56 FR 26774, June 11, 1991; [Amendment 11 approved 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
4/6/94 final rule is being published within days of these annual management measures]). Regulations at 50 CFR part
661 provide the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments to the management measures, within limits
set by the FMP, by notification in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These management measures for the 1994 ocean salmon fisheries were recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management
Council (Council) at its April 5&hyph;8, 1994, meeting.

In accordance with the FMP, the Council's Salmon Technical Team (STT) and staff economist prepared several reports
for the Council, its advisors, and the public. The first report, ``Review of 1993 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' summarizes
the 1993 ocean salmon fisheries and assesses how well the Council's management objectives were met in 1993. The second
report, ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' provides the 1994 salmon
stock abundance projections and analyzes the impacts on the stocks and Council management goals if the 1993 regulations
or regulatory procedures were applied to the 1994 stock abundance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met on March 8&hyph;11, 1994, in Portland, OR, to develop proposed management options for 1994. Three
commercial and three recreational fishery management options were proposed for analysis and public comment. These
options presented various combinations of management measures designed to protect numerous weak stocks of coho
and chinook salmon and provide for ocean harvests of more abundant stocks of chinook salmon (primarily Sacramento
Fall chinook). All options provided for no directed harvest of coho salmon coastwide and no non-treaty commercial
or recreational fishing north of Cape Falcon, OR. After the March Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared
a third report, ``Preseason Report II Analysis of Proposed Regulatory Options for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,''
which analyzes the effects of the proposed 1994 management options. This report also was distributed to the Council,
its advisors, and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings on the proposed options were held March 28&hyph;30, 1994, in Westport, WA; Warrenton and Coos Bay,
OR; and Arcata, CA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met on April 5&hyph;8, 1994, in Burlingame, California, to adopt its final 1994 recommendations. Following
the April Council meeting, the STT and staff economist prepared a fourth report, ``Preseason Report III Analysis
of Council-Adopted Management Measures for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' which analyzes the environmental and
socio-economic effects of the Council's final recommendations. This report also was distributed to the Council,
its advisors, and the public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many salmon runs returning to Washington, Oregon, and California streams in 1994 are expected to be at record low levels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary resource concerns are for Klamath River fall chinook; Columbia River hatchery chinook; Oregon Production
Index area coho stocks destined for the Columbia River and the California and Oregon coasts, particularly Oregon
coastal natural coho; and Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho. Management of all of these stocks is affected
by interjurisdictional agreements among tribal, State, Federal, and/or Canadian managers.

Chinook Salmon Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
California Central Valley stocks are relatively abundant compared to the other chinook stocks of the Pacific coast.
The Central Valley Index of abundance of combined Central Valley chinook stocks is estimated to be 503,000 fish for
1994, slightly above the post-season estimate of the index for 1993 and 18 percent below the average of the index from
1970&hyph;1993. The escapement goal range of 122,000 to 180,000 Sacramento River adult fall chinook was not met in
1990, 1991, or 1992, and was near the low end of the goal range in 1993. Preseason modeling predicted that regulations
comparable to those of 1993 would result in an escapement of Sacramento River fall chinook within the escapement goal
range in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Winter-run chinook from the Sacramento River are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as an endangered species
(59 FR 440, January 4, 1994) and are a consideration in establishing ocean fishing regulations. The 1993 spawning
run size estimate totaled 341 adults, a substantial decline from the 1992 run-size estimate of 1,180 adults. The abundance
of the winter run in the ocean at the beginning of the fishing season is not forecast.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Klamath River fall chinook ocean abundance is expected to be 137,600 age-3 and age-4 fish at the beginning of the fishing
season. This forecast is 16 percent below last year's actual abundance, and 58 percent below the average of estimates
for 1985&hyph;1993. The spawning escapement goal for Klamath River fall chinook is 33&hyph;34 percent of the potential
adults with a minimum of 35,000 natural spawners (wild run salmon or fish that spawn independent of hatcheries). Although
ocean escapement to the Klamath River (in-river run size) in 1993 was the largest recorded since 1989, the natural
spawning escapement of 20,900 adults fell short of the goal of 38,000, set in 1993 by emergency action by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary), and was below the FMP's minimum natural spawner requirement of 35,000 for a fourth consecutive
year. Preseason modeling predicted that harvest regulations similar to those adopted in 1993 would result in an ocean
escapement that would not be sufficient to achieve the minimum spawning escapement floor and to provide for in-river
sport and Indian tribal fisheries in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years of low abundance, the procedures used to model the Klamath fall chinook population have consistently
overestimated stock abundance and underestimated the hatchery component of the spawning run. In 1994, the Council
implemented changes in the predictor used to forecast age-3 ocean abundance and developed a new predictor of the relative
sizes of the natural and hatchery spawning escapements. As a result, the 1994 forecast of the adult ocean population
is 11 percent smaller, and the spawning escapement (hatchery and natural) required to achieve the natural spawner
floor is 36 percent greater than would have been predicted using the previous methodology. The new predictor is considered
to reflect more accurately the actual ocean abundance and proportion of natural and hatchery stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, as authorized at 50 CFR part 661, Appendix IV.B., the Council recommended, and the Secretary approved, a change
in the Klamath River fall chinook spawning escapement rate goal from 35 percent to between 33 and 34 percent (54 FR 19800,
May 8, 1989). That change was not codified at the time. The change in the spawning escapement rate goal is herein codified

Oregon coastal chinook stocks include south-migrating and localized stocks primarily from southern Oregon streams,
and north-migrating chinook stocks that generally originate in central and northern Oregon streams. Abundance
of south-migrating and localized stocks is expected to be low, similar to the levels observed in 1993. These stocks
are important contributors to ocean fisheries off Oregon and northern California. The generalized expectation
for north-migrating stocks is for a continuation of average to above-average abundance as observed in recent years.
These stocks contribute primarily to ocean fisheries off British Columbia and Alaska. It is expected that the aggregate
Oregon coastal chinook spawning escapement goal of 150,000 to 200,000 naturally spawning adults will be met in 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates of Columbia River chinook abundance vary by stock as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upper Columbia River spring and summer chinook. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numbers of upriver spring chinook predicted to return to the river (49,000) in 1994 are 56 percent below the 1993 run
size of 111,500 fish, and 13 percent below the 1979&hyph;1984 average of 56,600 fish. The 1994 depressed stock status
reflects a substantial decline from recent improvements (1985&hyph;1990 and 1992&hyph;1993) in the status of this
stock. The 1985&hyph;1990 and 1992&hyph;1993 increases from the poor returns in the early 1980s are primarily the
result of increases of hatchery stocks. The natural stock component remains depressed. Ocean escapement is expected
to be significantly below the goal of 115,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver spring chinook are affected
only slightly by ocean harvests in Council area fisheries, with the contribution of these stocks being generally
1 percent or less of the total chinook catch north of Cape Falcon, OR. Expected ocean escapement of adult upriver summer
chinook is 15,700 fish. The 1994 stock status remains extremely depressed, with ocean escapement being about 20 percent
of the lower end of the spawning escapement goal range of 80,000 to 90,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver
summer chinook migrate to the far north and are not a major contributor to ocean fisheries off Washington and Oregon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Willamette River Spring Chinook. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Willamette River spring chinook returns are projected to be 72,000 fish, 15 percent above the 1993 run of 62,600 fish,
and 11 percent greater than the 1980&hyph;1984 average return of 65,000 fish. Willamette River spring chinook stocks
are important contributors to Council area fishery catches north of Cape Falcon.

Columbia River Fall Chinook. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four distinct fall chinook stock units initially were identified, and recently a fifth stock unit has been added,
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Upriver bright fall chinook ocean escapement is expected to be 85,400 adults, 17 percent below the 1993 return
of 102,900 adults, and 7 percent above the 1981&hyph;1985 period of poor returns that averaged 79,500 adults. The
escapement goal for upriver bright fall chinook is 40,000 adults above McNary Dam. This stock has a northern ocean
migratory pattern and constitutes less than 10 percent of Council-area fisheries north of Cape Falcon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Lower river natural fall chinook ocean escapement is forecast at about 14,700 adults, 10 percent above the 1993
run size of 13,400. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Lower river hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is forecast at 36,100 adults, a 31 percent reduction from the
record low return observed in 1993 of 52,200 adults. This stock has been declining sharply since the record high return
in 1987. Lower Columbia River fall chinook stocks normally account for more than half the total catch in Council-area
fisheries north of Cape Falcon, with lower river hatchery fall chinook being the single largest contributing stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Spring Creek hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is projected to be about 20,200 adults, 20 percent above the
1993 return of 16,800 adults; the 1986&hyph;1990 average ocean escapement was 16,700 adults. The Spring Creek hatchery
fall chinook stock has been rebuilding slowly since the record low return in 1987, with a downturn in 1992 and 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Mid-Columbia bright fall chinook ocean escapement is projected to be about 23,900 adults, 13 percent below the
1993 return of 27,400 adults. These fall chinook are returns primarily from hatchery releases of bright fall chinook
stock in the area below McNary Dam, although some natural spawning in tributaries between Bonneville and McNary dams
is also occurring.

Coho Salmon Stocks

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Oregon Production Index (OPI) is an annual index of coho abundance from Leadbetter Point, WA, south through California.
It is the primary index of coho abundance for the Pacific ocean fishery. Oregon coastal and Columbia River coho stocks
are the primary components of the OPI. Beginning in 1988, the Council adopted revised estimation procedures that
were expected more accurately to predict abundance of the following individual OPI area stock components: public
hatchery, private hatchery, Oregon coastal natural (OCN) for rivers and lakes, and the Salmon Trout Enhancement
Program. Prediction methodologies are described in the Council's ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis
for 1988 Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' In response to the extremely low abundances expected in 1994, some changes to the
abundance predictors were implemented as described in the Council's ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis
for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' In particular, the current predictor for the OCN river component does not adequately
incorporate environmental variability, so an environment-based model is being used to predict abundance in 1994.
This model incorporates annual measurements of upwelling and sea surface temperatures and contains no provision
for the influence of spawner escapement. Further analysis of this model will occur before the 1995 season. The 1994
OPI is forecast to be a record low 239,700 coho, 69 percent below the 1993 preseason forecast of 767,000 coho, and 49
percent below the 1993 observed level of 470,900 fish. The 1994 estimate includes a record low of 140,900 OCN coho,
44 percent below the 1993 observed level of 250,800 fish and 27 percent below the previous record low of 192,500 fish
observed in 1987. The 1993 spawning escapement of the OCN stock was 170,200 fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocks are expected to be less abundant than forecast in 1993.
Abundances for Washington coastal stocks of Hoh, Queets, and Grays Harbor natural coho are projected to be 40 percent,
47 percent, and about 60 percent below the 1993 preseason predictions, respectively. Abundances for Puget Sound
stocks of Skagit, Stillaguamish, and Hood Canal natural coho are projected to be 45 percent, 65 percent, and 72 percent
below the 1993 preseason predictions, respectively. Even in the absence of ocean and inside (Strait of Juan de Fuca
and Puget Sound) fisheries, natural coho run sizes are forecast to be well below spawning escapement goals. These
low expected abundances are thought to be the result of low freshwater flows in 1992, poor marine survival associated
with anomalous ocean conditions, and long-term habitat degradation. Abundance forecasts for Washington coastal
and Puget Sound hatchery production are also well below 1993 expectations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the area south of Cape Falcon, the management measures in this rule are based primarily on concerns for Klamath River
fall chinook, Sacramento River winter chinook, and OCN coho. The greatest constraint on the ocean management measures
was the record low abundance of OCN coho as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council recommended measures that result in the harvest of Klamath River fall chinook being shifted predominantly
southward off California, to maximize access to abundant Central Valley chinook stocks. Management constraints
on Klamath River fall chinook resulted in restrictive fishing seasons in the area between Humbug Mountain, OR, and
Horse Mountain, CA, termed the Klamath Management Zone (KMZ), as well as in the areas both north and south of the KMZ.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary issued a final rule (58 FR 68063, December 23, 1993) recognizing the Federally-reserved fishing rights
of the Yurok and Hoopa Valley Tribes, as acknowledged and quantified in an opinion issued by the Solicitor, Department
of the Interior, as other applicable law for the purposes of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(Magnuson Act). The 1994 management measures provide for an ocean exploitation rate on age-4 Klamath fall chinook
of 9 percent. This restriction of ocean harvest is required to provide equal sharing of the harvest of Klamath River
fall chinook between the Tribes and non-Indian fishermen, as set out in the Solicitor's opinion, as well as to meet
the spawning escapement goal floor of 35,000 natural adult spawners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Winter-run chinook from the Sacramento River are listed under the ESA as an endangered species. In 1991, NMFS concluded
a formal consultation with the Council regarding the impacts of the ocean salmon fishing regulations on the winter
run. The biological opinion issued from that consultation determined that the 1990 level of impacts from the ocean
fisheries would not jeopardize the continued existence of the winter run. NMFS also recommended shortening the recreational
fishing season off central California and closure of an area at the mouth of San Francisco Bay during the time when the
winter run fish are entering the Bay. These recommended conservation measures were implemented in 1991 and remain
a part of the salmon management measures for 1994. The overall impact of the 1994 salmon management program on the winter
run is expected to be significantly less than in 1990, the base year for the biological opinion. This expectation is
based on the harvest rate model for the Central Valley Index stocks of fall chinook, which predicts a harvest rate of
53 percent in 1994, as compared to 79 percent in 1990. These rates are only indicators of the relative impact on the winter
run, because these fish are less vulnerable to the ocean fisheries than fall-run chinook, due to the timing of the seasons,
as well as growth and migration patterns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under recently approved Amendment 11 to the FMP, the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho is 42 spawners per mile in
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's ``standard'' coastal index survey areas. This translates to a maximum
sustainable yield (MSY) goal of 200,000 spawners. At lower abundance levels, only incidental impacts, rather than
directed OCN coho fisheries, are allowed. When the predicted spawner escapement is less than or equal to 28 spawners
per mile (which translates to 135,000 spawners), the FMP allows an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent,
but only if it is the minimum incidental harvest necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and will not cause irreparable
harm to the OCN stock (135,000 spawners was the spawning escapement floor under the FMP prior to approval of Amendment
11; 200,000 spawners is the spawning escapement floor established by Amendment 11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 abundance estimate for OCN coho is for a record low of 140,900 fish. At this abundance level, the FMP only allows
a minimum incidental harvest that will not cause irreparable harm to the stock. The 1994 management measures result
in a total OCN coho exploitation rate of only 11 percent, of which about 6.4 percent are impacts associated with prosecution
of Council area fisheries and about 4.6 percent are impacts associated with non-Council-managed directed fisheries
(Canadian, Alaskan, and inside fisheries). Based on these measures, OCN coho spawning escapement is estimated to
be 125,500 adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, has determined that the recommended harvest rate will not cause irreparable
harm to the OCN coho salmon stock for several reasons. First, the 1993 spawning escapement goal was achieved, although
the geographic distribution of spawners was not optimal. As a result of achieving the spawning escapement goal in
1993, the resulting production of many individual stocks in 1996 should return to normal levels, if ocean survival
conditions also return to normal. Second, under the 1994 fishing regime (no coho retention), spawning escapement
is projected to be 125,500 fish. This level of escapement, although not optimal because it is less than the 200,000
MSY escapement goal, is not at such a low level that OCN coho stocks cannot recover when ocean survival conditions improve.
Of greatest concern are specific individual stocks within the OCN complex, such as Tillamook Bay stocks, that have
exhibited extremely poor spawning escapements in recent years. However, the predominantly southern distribution
of the chinook harvest, the prohibition of coho retention in all chinook-only fisheries, and the extreme measures
being imposed by the states in internal waters to protect coho salmon that return to individual watersheds, makes
it unlikely that the ocean salmon fishing regime in 1994 will cause irreparable harm to any OCN coho salmon stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has also considered whether the 11 percent incidental harvest rate is the minimum necessary to prosecute other
fisheries. Because the bycatch in non-salmon fisheries, such as the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery, is almost
exclusively chinook salmon, the bycatch of coho salmon in non-salmon fisheries is not a large concern. The Council
determined that harvestable numbers of Central Valley and Klamath River fall chinook stocks warranted a chinook
fishery on these stocks. In order to minimize the impacts on OCN coho salmon during these chinook fisheries, the Council
recommended, and NMFS provides in this action that no coho retention be allowed. Thus the only mortality to coho salmon
will be the result of hooking mortality from chinook fishing. In addition, the Council adjusted the geographic distribution
of the fisheries so that the majority of chinook fishing occurs to the south, primarily off California, where the catch
of OCN coho is the lowest. The Council recommended this geographic shift to the South to protect coho. However, this
shift occurs at the expense of Oregon fishermen, who now will not have the opportunity to harvest as large a proportion
of Klamath River fall chinook stocks as they might have absent coho conservation concerns. Finally, the States of
Oregon and Washington have closed the Columbia River Buoy 10 fishery for coho salmon, and Oregon has taken additional
restrictive actions in estuarine and freshwater fisheries to minimize the impacts of fishing on OCN coho. Based on
these actions, NMFS believes that the 11 percent ocean and freshwater harvest rate is the minimum harvest rate necessary
to prosecute other fisheries.

Retention of coho salmon is prohibited in all areas due to the projected record low coho abundance. All seasons listed

North of Cape Falcon

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the projected record low returns for Washington coastal coho, Puget Sound natural and hatchery coho stocks,
and Oregon coastal and Columbia River coho, unprecedented action is being taken to close the non-treaty commercial
troll and recreational ocean fisheries north of Cape Falcon in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocks are expected to be less abundant than forecast in 1993.
Numbers of coho entering freshwater are either below spawner escapement goals (Queets, Grays Harbor, Skagit, Stillaguamish,
and Hood Canal natural coho) or at the lower end of the spawner escapement goal range (Quillayute Falls and Hoh natural
coho). These low expected abundances are the result of low flows in 1992, poor marine survival associated with anomalous
ocean conditions, and long-term habitat degradation. Abundance forecasts for Washington coastal and Puget Sound
hatchery production are also well below 1993 expectations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even in the absence of ocean salmon fisheries north of Cape Falcon, the Council wanted to ensure that the impacts on
Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook stocks, which are listed as threatened species under the ESA, did not exceed
recent years' levels of impacts. For Snake River wild spring chinook, the available information indicates that it
is highly unlikely these fish are impacted in Council-area fisheries. For Snake River wild summer chinook, these
fish comprise only a very small proportion of total chinook abundance in the Council management area, and it is unlikely
these fish are significantly impacted in Council-area fisheries. For Snake River wild fall chinook that are caught
in Council-area fisheries, the STT estimated significant reductions in the ocean exploitation rate under the Council's
recommended 1994 ocean measures compared to the 1986&hyph;1990 average by using the Lyons Ferry Hatchery stock to
represent Snake River wild fall chinook. These reductions in the ocean exploitation rate total over 90 percent for
north of Cape Falcon and 80 percent for combined north and south of Cape Falcon.

In 1994, treaty Indian troll fisheries north of Cape Falcon are governed by a quota of 16,400 chinook, with no retention
of coho. The all-except-coho seasons will open May 1 and extend through June 30, if the chinook quota is not reached.
The minimum length restrictions for all treaty ocean fisheries, excluding ceremonial and subsistence harvest,
is 24 in. (61 cm) for chinook.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The timing of the March and April Council meetings makes it impracticable for the Council to recommend fishing seasons
to the Secretary that begin before May 1 of the same year. Therefore, openings earlier than May 1 for 1995 fishing seasons
are being provided for at this time. The Council recommended, and the Secretary concurs, that the following recreational
seasons will open in 1995: (1) The area from Point Arena to the U.S.-Mexico border will open on the nearest Saturday
to March 1 for all salmon with a two-fish daily bag limit, except for closure of the control zone near the mouth of San
Francisco Bay from the opening of the season through March 31; and (2) the area from Horse Mountain to Point Arena will
open on the nearest Saturday to February 15 for all salmon with a two-fish daily bag limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following tables and text are the management measures recommended by the Council for 1994 and, as specified, for
1995. The Secretary concurs with these recommendations and finds them responsive to the goals of the FMP, the requirements
of the resource, and the socio-economic factors affecting resource users. The management measures are consistent
with requirements of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law, including U.S. obligations to Indian Tribes with
treaty-secured fishing rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following management measures are adopted for 1994 and, as specified, for 1995 under 50 CFR part 661.

Troll Fishing Gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Troll fishing gear for the Fishery Management Area (FMA) is defined as one or more lines that drag hooks behind a moving
fishing vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line or lines must be affixed to the vessel and must not be intentionally
disengaged from the vessel at any time during the fishing operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recreational Fishing Gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recreational fishing gear for the FMA is defined as angling tackle consisting of a line with not more than one artificial
lure or natural bait attached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line must be attached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely
attended; the rod and reel must be held by hand while playing a hooked fish. No person may use more than one rod and line
while fishing off Oregon or Washington. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that portion of the FMA off California, the line must be attached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely attended.
Weights directly attached to a line may not exceed 4 pounds (1.8 kg). There is no limit to the number of lines that a person
may use while recreational fishing for salmon off California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing includes any activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of
fish.

Inseason Notice Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Actual notice of inseason management actions will be provided by a telephone hotline administered by the Northwest
Region, NMFS, 206&hyph;526&hyph;6667 or 800&hyph;662&hyph;9825, and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts.
These broadcasts are announced on Channel 16 VHF&hyph;FM and 2182 Khz at frequent intervals. The announcements designate
the channel or frequency over which the Notice to Mariners will be immediately broadcast. Inseason actions will also
be filed with the Office of the Federal Register as soon as practicable. Since provisions of these management measures
may be altered by inseason actions, fishermen should monitor either the telephone hotline or Coast Guard broadcasts
for current information for the area in which they are fishing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notification of annual management measures and technical amendment are exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 661.23 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations states that the Secretary will publish a notice establishing
management measures for ocean salmon each year and will invite public comments prior to their effective date. If the
Secretary determines, for good cause, that a notice must be issued without affording prior opportunity for public
comment, the measures will become effective, however, comments on the notice will be received by the Secretary for
a period of 15 days after the filing of the notice with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many ocean salmon seasons are scheduled to start May 1, the management measures must be in effect by this date.
Each year the schedule for establishing the annual management measures begins in February with the compilation and
analysis of biological and socioeconomic data for the previous year's fishery and salmon stock abundance estimates
for the current year. Two meetings of the Council follow in March and April which incorporate a public review period.
In 1994, the Council recommended management measures at the conclusion of its meeting on April 8, resulting in a short
time frame for implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, delay in the start of the fishing season would deny ocean fishermen access to harvestable salmon stocks
which, if taken later in the year, would produce unacceptable impacts on other salmon stocks, such as those listed
under the ESA. Due to the migratory patterns of the various salmon stocks, harvest regimes account for the timing and
location of harvestable stocks in concert with the stocks of concern. Therefore, in light of the limited available
time and the adverse effect of delay, the Secretary has determined that good cause exists to waive prior notice and
comment on the management measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this document will be effective without prior opportunity for comment, the public had opportunity to comment
on these management measures during the process of their development. The public participated in the March and April
Council, STT, and Salmon Advisory Subpanel meetings, and in public hearings held in Washington, Oregon, and California
in late March that generated the management actions recommended by the Council and approved by the Secretary. Written
public comments were invited by the Council between the March and April Council meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technical amendment provisions of this regulatory action make only minor, non-substantive changes and do not
change operating practices in the fishery. Accordingly, it is unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to provide for
prior public comment, and there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) not to delay the effective date of the technical
amendment for 30 days. Comments will be accepted for 15 days after the effective date of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion that considered the effects of the FMP on Sacramento River winter-run
chinook salmon. The opinion concluded that implementation of the plan is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the species. The 1994 season falls within the scope of the 1991 opinion, and the seasons and management measures
comply with the recommendations and incidental take conditions contained in the biological opinion. Therefore,
it was not necessary to reinitiate consultation on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has issued a biological opinion that considered the effects of the 1994 salmon management measures on wild sockeye
salmon, wild spring/summer chinook salmon, and wild fall chinook salmon from the Snake River, which concluded the
fishery in 1994 under the FMP is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed stocks.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary of Commerce issues this final rule to implement Amendment 11 (Amendment) to the Fishery Management
Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (FMP).
The Amendment modifies the spawning escapement goal for Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho salmon and the criteria
for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, OR.
The Amendment is intended to: (1) Address persistent low OCN coho stock abundance and annual escapement goals below
maximum sustainable yield (MSY), (2) prevent imbalances in recreational coho harvest allocation at low allowable
harvest levels, and (3) prevent the frequent use of emergency rulemaking to implement annual management measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ocean salmon fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the United States (3 to 200 miles offshore) in the Pacific
Ocean off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under the FMP. The FMP was developed by the Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Magnuson Act), and approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) in 1978. Since then, the FMP has been amended
10 times, with implementing regulations codified at 50 CFR part 661. From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually.
In 1984, a framework amendment was implemented that provided the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments
in the regulations without annual amendments. Amendments to the framework FMP were implemented in 1987, 1988, 1989,
and 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council prepared the Amendment to the FMP and submitted it to the Secretary for approval under the provisions of
the Magnuson Act. On January 10, 1994, the Secretary began formal review of the Amendment. A notice of availability
and a proposed rule were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3327), and February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4895), respectively. The preamble for the proposed rule
discussed the rationale for the proposed amendment. The comment period on the Amendment ended March 10, and on the
proposed rule March 21, 1994; two written comments were received. The Amendment was approved on April 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As implemented by this final rule, the Amendment modifies the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho salmon. The OCN
coho stock is composed of naturally produced coho salmon from Oregon coastal streams. OCN coho are important contributors
to the ocean harvest, as the stock aggregate constitutes the largest component of naturally produced coho caught
in ocean salmon fisheries off Oregon and California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified escapement goal is intended to achieve an aggregate OCN adult spawning density of 42 naturally spawning
adults per mile in standard index survey areas each year. The standard index survey areas are 48 different stream sections
that have been surveyed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) each year since 1950. Under the current
methods used by ODFW, the spawners in the standard index area are extrapolated for 4,764 miles of coastal spawning
habitat. This translates to a numerical spawning escapement goal of 200,000. The original FMP spawning escapement
goal of 200,000 was based on this extrapolation. This number of adult spawners per mile was documented as the estimated
MSY spawning escapement level in an ODFW study of coastal stream spawning escapements and subsequent production
from 1950 to 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendment also provides that when OCN coho abundance is forecast to be less than 125 percent of the annual numerical
escapement goal, or below 250,000 fish at the present spawner escapement goal of 200,000 adults, an incidental exploitation
rate of up to 20 percent will be allowed for ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting on non-OCN coho salmon stocks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the predicted OCN coho spawning escapement is 28 or less adults per mile in standard index areas, the Council may
allow only an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent. The Council will evaluate the actual level of incidental
harvest of OCN coho that might be expected to occur in fisheries for chinook salmon and non-OCN coho salmon and will
recommend only the minimum incidental harvest rate necessary to prosecute other fisheries, provided that that rate
will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN coho stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendment also modifies the criteria for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho
salmon harvest south of Cape Falcon, OR, when the allowable recreational coho allocation for the entire area is equal
to or less than 167,000 fish. The Amendment establishes two subareas with independent impact quotas to ensure that
a large southward shift in the recreational harvest does not occur. Of the total recreational allocation, the subarea
from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain, Oregon, receives 70 percent and the subarea south of Humbug Mountain receives
30 percent, the purpose being to avoid large deviations from historical harvest shares. The two subareas will be managed
for their respective impact quotas; the recreational fisheries for coho salmon in each area may be closed upon attainment
of the quota except for the area south of Point Arena, California (38
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;57
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.). South of Humbug Mountain, there are two additional conditions: (1) An impact guideline of 3 percent
of the overall recreational allocation south of Cape Falcon will be applied from Horse Mountain to Point Arena, California;
and (2) the recreational fishery for coho salmon will not be closed south of Point Arena, even if the fishery between
Humbug Mountain and Point Arena is closed, upon projected attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota;
but the projected harvest through the end of the year will be included in the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.
Quota transfers between subareas are allowed on a one-for-one basis, but only if chinook constraints preclude access
to coho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its March 8&hyph;11, 1994, meeting the Council considered and adopted management options for annual ocean salmon
fisheries under the assumption that the Amendment and its implementing regulations would be in place when coastwide
ocean salmon fishing seasons open on May 1, 1994, as regularly scheduled. During this meeting, the Council clarified
its intent regarding the fishing allowed when the spawner escapement is less than or equal to 28 coho per mile in the
standard index areas. Under the existing plan, no fishing would have been allowed at that level of spawner escapement.
This is a standard that is more restrictive than under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which allows some incidental
take of listed stocks. Therefore, the Amendment will allow an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent that
will provide only the minimum incidental harvest necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances
will cause irreparable harm to the OCN coho stock. This standard of the minimum incidental harvest and no irreparable
harm replaces other allocative measures in the plan regarding OCN coho at spawner escapement levels at or below 28
spawners per mile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the Amendment requires changes to the regulatory language in the Appendix to 50 CFR part 661. The
only change to the proposed regulations published on February 2, 1994, clarifies this issue of allocation at low spawner
levels by adding language in paragraph 2(b)(i) of Appendix section II.B.

The spawning escapement goal proposed in the Amendment and the proposed rule does not adequately reflect documented
declines in fish size, fecundity, survival rates, ocean production, and rainfall since 1979. The spawning escapement
goal of 200,000 adults is most likely inadequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCN coho stock has been the subject of ongoing review under the Council management process, which requires using
the best scientific information and methodology available. There are several reasons for the consistent and significant
depression in the OCN coho stock, but determination of a primary cause is not currently possible given the inadequacies
in the information available on the stock and its habitat. Additional studies may provide a better definition of the
total OCN coho spawning population. The ODFW is currently in the fourth year of a 5-year study of the methodology used
in estimating OCN coho escapements. The results of that study, coupled with any additional biological data, will
be used to develop a biologically sounder OCN coho escapement goal. Implementation of the Amendment does not hinder
further investigations on the appropriateness of the numerical goal of 200,000 adults. The proposed rule anticipated
revision to the spawning escapement goal, including the 200,000 number, by describing the processes by which the
goal would be revised. If the estimated total number of spawners at the MSY level that is calculated by extrapolating
from the 42 adults per mile in the standard index survey areas is revised, further changes to the FMP or its implementing
regulations would not be necessary. If the number (42) of adult spawners per mile in the standard index survey areas
is revised, the FMP would need to be amended. The framework in 50 CFR part 661, Appendix IV.B. provides for the modification
of escapement goals based on technical evidence.

The Salmon Technical Team has expressed its concern that the unequal distribution of spawners along the Oregon coast
may be an important factor in recent OCN stock status declines. The Council recognizes the problem, but there are insufficient
data at this time to implement separate escapement goals by subdividing the OCN stock aggregate. This matter will
be subject to further analysis.

The escapement goal should be increased by 10 percent to hedge against impacts of harvest on genetic diversity and
ecosystem integrity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 200,000-fish MSY escapement goal has not been met for a number of years, and does not appear to be attainable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1994. Because the goal represents an optimal production level and not a conservation threshold, it provides for
substantial genetic diversity. Although there does not appear to be a statistical basis for any particular level
of additional conservatism, NMFS agrees that, when stock sizes are such that the number of spawners is forecast to
be below 28 per mile when directed fisheries are not allowed, substantial conservatism should be used when allowing
incidental impacts for other fisheries.

Allowable incidental take should be reduced to a maximum of 10 percent to prosecute other fisheries, and should only
be allowed when abundance is between 225,000 and 150,000 fish. No incidental take should be allowed that would result
in escapement below the escapement floor (28 spawners per mile) until scientific information establishes that incidental
take that violates the floor would not result in irreparable harm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The maximum incidental exploitation rate of 20 percent provides flexibility during the annual preseason management
process for structuring fishing seasons to access salmon stocks with allowable harvest levels. Flexibility is also
needed to account for harvest impacts by fisheries outside the Council's purview (e.g., freshwater fisheries and
Canadian fisheries). NMFS will rely on the annual management process to determine the appropriate level of allowable
incidental take. As with any management measure recommended by the Council, NMFS will consider comments by the Council,
its advisers, and the public before implementing an incidental harvest rate. The Regional Director will provide
guidance to the Council on an appropriate rate after consideration of the available information as supported by the
administrative record. The Council demonstrated its ability to exercise harvest restraint on OCN coho, as in 1991,
1992, and 1993, when it recommended emergency regulations to reduce the ocean harvest rate on OCN coho from the levels
set in Amendment 7 to the FMP. For the 1994 season, the Council recommended management measures with an incidental
harvest rate of 11 percent. The standard of the minimum incidental harvest and no irreparable harm replaces other
allocative measures in the plan regarding OCN coho at spawner escapement levels at or below 28 spawners per mile.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A reduction in the body size of salmon could cause a significant reduction in fish productivity and subsequent declines
in stock abundance. The direct relationship between fecundity and fish size has been established in prior research.
Yet the proposed spawning escapement goal has not taken this relationship into account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCN spawning escapement goal is based on data from many series of years. Body size and fecundity undoubtedly varied
depending on ocean feeding conditions, with returning spawners being both above and below the average body size and
fecundity for the time series. The spawning escapement goal is based on average conditions, which take into account
this variability. Since fishery managers cannot predict whether body size will be larger or smaller than normal prior
to the fish appearing in the catch and on the spawning grounds, it is not practical to adjust either the fishing seasons
or the annual spawning escapement goals to account for body size. The spawning escapement goal implemented by the
Amendment assumes average conditions and is set at a level to accommodate annual variations.

Measures for reducing the incidental take of OCN coho are addressed during the annual process for setting management
measures. The Council is currently reviewing its list of research and data needs, which includes improving estimates
of commercial troll shaker mortality. These estimates will be determined by contact rates in various fisheries.
The Council will continue to consider new information as it becomes available, in developing ways to reduce this mortality
through gear selectivity or modification. The Council determined that the Amendment provides the best approach
at the present time, given the currently available information.

The OCN spawning escapement goal implemented by this amendment is based solely on wild fish. Current hatchery practices
are designed to discourage the intermixing of wild and hatchery stocks. Although some intermixing probably occurs,
it is thought to be a small enough proportion of the total spawning population that it does not adversely affect the
production of wild coho salmon.

A supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) on the FMP should be prepared incorporating new scientific
information concerning coho and other salmon since the last SEIS was prepared in 1984.

The environmental assessment (EA) for the Amendment was prepared in accordance with NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6
on Environmental Review Procedures. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), reviewed the EA and concluded
that this action will not significantly affect the human environment. Therefore, preparation of an SEIS is not required.
While new information on salmon stocks has been developed since the last SEIS, prepared for the framework amendment
to the FMP in 1984, there is not sufficient new information specific to the OCN coho stock to warrant preparation of
an SEIS for this action. Under the ESA process, a thorough evaluation of salmon stocks in Washington, Oregon, and California
is being conducted that may result in preparation of at least one SEIS for the FMP.

This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator determined that this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review
(RIR) and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) that are incorporated in the Amendment document and
may be obtained from the Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). A summary of the RIR/IRFA was published on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4897). No public comments were received relating
to small entities and no changes were made in the initial document. Therefore, the document will now serve as a final
regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA determined that this rule must be effective no later than May 1, 1994, when coastwide ocean salmon fishing seasons
are scheduled to open. Therefore, it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay for 30 days the effective
date of this final rule, and the agency finds good cause to waive the delayed effectiveness provision (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3))
of the Administrative Procedure Act.

 (i) *&blank;*&blank;* The recreational allowable ocean harvest will be distributed between the two major recreational
subareas when the recreational allocation is equal to or less than 167,000 fish, in accordance with paragraph 2(b)(v)
of this appendix. At OCN spawning escapements of 28 or fewer adults per mile, the allocation provisions of paragraph
2(b) of this appendix do not apply. Fisheries will be established that will provide only the minimum incidental harvest
of OCN coho necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances will cause irreparable harm to
the OCN stock.

(v) When the recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total recreational allowable ocean harvest of
coho will be divided between two major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation will be 70
percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two
impact quotas may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. Horse Mountain
to Point Arena will be managed for an impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation.
The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest
impact between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected harvest impact that will be taken south
of Point Arena to the end of the season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The recreational fishery
for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.

4At OCN stock sizes below 125 percent of the annual numerical escapement goal, an exploitation rate of up to 20 percent
will be allowed for incidental impacts of the combined ocean troll, sport, and freshwater fisheries. At OCN spawning
escapements of 28 or fewer adults per mile, an exploitation rate of up to 20 percent may be allowed to provide only minimum
incidental harvest to prosecute other fisheries, provided the rate chosen will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN
stock.
