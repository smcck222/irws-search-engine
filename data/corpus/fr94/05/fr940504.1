SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs 21 and 22 of Annex 703.2 of Chapter 7 of the NAFTA relate to the trade of sugar and sugar containing products
which receive benefits under re-export programs. Paragraph 21 requires that the United States notify Mexico, in
writing, of any export to Mexico is not obligated to grant NAFTA duty preferences for such products. However, paragraph
22(b) provides that Mexico shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of (i) U.S. raw sugar that will be refined in
Mexico and re-exported to the United States, and (ii) refined sugar that has been refined in the United States from
Mexican raw sugar. Moreover, imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant to paragraph 22(b) will not be
subject to, or counted under, any tariff rate quota. Comments with respect to implementation of these provisions
will be considered in drafting proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are encouraged to consider the rules relating to the maximum license sizes (7 CFR 1530.102(c)
and 1530.202(c)) and provide comments supporting any change. FAS is considering having all programs conform to the
metric system. This change would revise the maximum license sizes from short tons to metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another rule change being considered relates to changes in the notice of transfer submission to the Licensing Authority.
The provisions at 7 CFR 1530.106(c) and 1530.204(c) relating to the original notice of transfer being submitted to
the Licensing Authority within 10 days of the transfer date will be reviewed for possible changes. The agency is considering
having the refiner licensee transmit to FAS the original notice of transfer within X days of the shipment date and then
simply receive and store confirmations from the manufacturer licensees. Information concerning numerous transfers
within an X-day period could be submitted to the Licensing Authority, either by mail or by electronic means.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS is also considering modifying the rule concerning licensee certifications in 7 CFR 1530.105(b). The additional
requirement the agency is considering is having the licensee provide certification to the Licensing Authority within
95 days of the date of export or last certification which ever comes first. An alternative could be to have periodic
reports (e.g., weekly, monthly, or quarterly depending on the volume of license activity). This change would allow
the Licensing Authority to establish greater compliance safeguards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensees in the Refined Sugar Re-export program have been informed by FAS that during the time domestic marketing
allotments are in effect, licensees' sugar export shipments could not be certified to the Licensing Authority as
being eligible for license credit except when any domestic sugar can be verified as being counted against marketing
allotment allocations. FAS is interested in developing appropriate rules that would incorporate this limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS also is interested in comments addressing the creation of a program to provide for imports of raw cane sugar exempt
from the tariff-rate quota on condition that an equivalent quantity of raw sugar is exported. Currently, subheading
1701.11.02 and additional U.S. note 3(c) to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS)
authorizes the sugar licensing programs but provides only for imports of raw sugar ``to be used for the production
(other than by distillation) of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar
in human food consumption, or to be refined and re-exported in refined form or in sugar-containing products.'' This
provision would need to be amended to permit a raw sugar swap program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS is interested in comments relating to the implementation of an automated data system linking licensees with the
Licensing Authority. Automated data processing procedures relating to the use of standardized forms for notices
of transfer and certifications for export credit are of particular interest. Rule change suggestions for providing
a structured data reporting format to enhance program administration and assist in verifying program compliance
are also requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS will give major consideration to the suggestions of manufacturer licensees in the sugar to be re-exported in sugar
containing products program with respect to contractual manufacturing arrangements with co-packers. Comments
should center on the control of quota-exempt sugar to prevent diversion onto the domestic market and the means by which
manufacturer licensees would establish eligibility to receive credit for sugar containing product exports for
products manufactured and exported by a co-packer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAS is also considering changing the licenses used under the Sugar for the Production of Polyhydric Alcohol program
from a license to import raw sugar to a license to receive transfers of refined sugar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this will be the best opportunity to modify program regulations, program participants should address any other
issues that they deem appropriate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations concerning program eligibility requirements.
These revisions will direct field offices to suspend processing of an application if an applicant is found to be delinquent
on a Federal debt until the delinquency is resolved, and to deny credit if a Federal judgment is found against an applicant.
This action is necessary to implement requirements of OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs
and Non-Tax Receivables.'' Denying credit to applicants against whom there is a Federal judgment is mandated by provisions
of the Federal Debt Collections Procedures Act of 1990. The intended effect of this action is to instruct field offices
on how to obtain more information to be used in determining loan, grant and loan servicing eligibility.

The current loan application procedures require that an applicant provide certification that it is not delinquent
on a Federal debt. For the purpose of verifying an applicant's certification, FmHA proposes to amend its instructions
by revising each eligibility section to instruct the field offices to access the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
Credit Alert Interactive Voice System (CAIVRS) to verify that the applicant is not delinquent on a Federal debt. If
a delinquency is found, processing of the application will be suspended. The applicant will be notified that processing
has been suspended and will be asked to contact the appropriate Federal agency, at the telephone number provided by
CAIVRS, to resolve the delinquency. When the applicant provides FmHA with official documentation that the delinquency
has been paid in full or otherwise resolved, processing of the application will be continued. If the applicant is unable
to resolve the delinquency, or if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than
the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, is found, assistance may be denied.

Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS) Inquiry,'' to determine if the applicant is delinquent on a Federal debt.
No decision to deny credit can be based solely on the results of the CAIVRS inquiry. If CAIVRS identifies a delinquent
Federal debt, the District Office will immediately suspend processing of the application. The applicant will be
notified that processing has been suspended and will be asked to contact the appropriate Federal agency, at the telephone
number provided by CAIVRS, to resolve the delinquency. When the applicant provides FmHA with official documentation
that the delinquency has been paid in full or otherwise resolved, processing of the application will be continued.

(2) An outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than the United States Tax Court),

is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. FmHA loan funds may not be used to satisfy the judgment. Questions about whether
or not a judgment is still outstanding should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel. If the judgment remains
unsatisfied, or if the applicant is delinquent on a Federal debt and is unable to resolve the delinquency, the application
will be rejected and the applicant will be notified of its right for an appeal in accordance with subpart B of part 1900
of this chapter. The Administrator may waive the rejection upon specific determination that it is in the best interest

cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting or storing a controlled substance (see 21 CFR part 1308, which is exhibit
C of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter (available in any FmHA office) for the definition of ``controlled substance'')
prior to loan approval in any crop year, the individual or entity shall be ineligible for a loan for the crop year in which
the individual or member, stockholder, partner, or joint operator of the entity was convicted and the four succeeding
crop years. Applicants will attest on Form FmHA 410&hyph;1, ``Application for FmHA Services,'' that as individuals
or that its members, if an entity, have not been convicted of such crimes after December 23, 1985.

or not a judgment is still outstanding should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel. The Administrator may
waive this restriction upon specific determination that it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will meet with the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and Yankee Atomic
Electric Company (YAEC) to discuss their written comments that are responsive to the States' concerns regarding
NRC's proposed rule on the environmental review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses.
These concerns focus on provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional
authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation.
The purpose of the meeting is to assure that the NRC staff and the public understands the approaches proposed by NEI
and YAEC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC published proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish
new requirements for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants
(September 17, 1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437, a draft Generic Environmental
Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in Part 51. In commenting on the
proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating
capacity, and alternative energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the
States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electric utilities with respect
to non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop options for
responding to these States' concerns and in doing so to solicit the views of the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff solicited the views of the States and others through three regional meetings and a request for written
comments (January 18, 1994; 59 FR 2542). To facilitate discussions with the States the NRC staff prepared a paper,
``Addressing the Concerns of States and Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy
Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants:
An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.'' The regional meetings were held in Rockville, MD, February 9, 1994; Rosemont, IL,
February 15, 1994; and Chicopee, MA, February 17, 1994. A number of parties, including NEI and YAEC, filed written
comments subsequent to the meetings. The discussion paper, meeting transcripts, and written comments, including
NEI's proposal dated March 23, 1994, and YAEC's proposal dated March 18, 1994, may be examined at the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEI and the YAEC proposals were not adequately developed for discussion at the time of the regional meetings, and
now the NRC staff needs to be assured that it understands the two proposals before reporting to the Commission on the
options considered. All interested persons are invited to attend as observers. After the NRC staff's questions have
been answered, time will be allowed to take questions and comments from the floor on the NEI and YAEC proposals. The
meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants,
replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This action would
require installation of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which would terminate the inspection requirement.
This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants,
which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1994, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), applicable
to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, to require inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron
quadrants, replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. That
action was prompted by a report that an in-flight failure of a ball bearing in a quadrant in the pilot's aileron control
system caused abnormal backlash of the pilot's aileron control. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent
reduced controllability of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, Jetstream has developed new swivel bearings that allow greater swivel action, which
would significantly decrease the likelihood of abnormal backlash of the aileron control due to bearing failure.
Bearing failure in the aileron quadrants, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures
for installation of swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has also issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, dated January 17, 1994.
The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision 1 of the service
bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10). The only change effected by Revision 2 is to reference
the modification described in Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027 as terminating action for the inspections
of the bearings in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops described in Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the United Kingdom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the
airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA
has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 to require installation
of new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for
the currently required inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this proposal have been revised to reference Revision 2 of Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026,
dated January 17, 1994, as an additional source of service information for accomplishing the inspections of the bearings
in the aileron quadrants and adjustment to the secondary stops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this proposal, take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane, per inspection
cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjustment to the secondary stops that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this
proposal, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this adjustment requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440,
or $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have already accomplished this action; therefore,
the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The installation of new swivel bearings (Modification JM41307A) that would be required by this proposal would take
approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts
would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
modification requirement of this proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $550 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action proposes to establish Class E airspace at Arcata, CA. An Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring
Equipment (ILS/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Arcata Municipal
Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach.
The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations
at Arcata Municipal Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Arcata, CA. This proposal would provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the ILS/DME
approach at Arcata, CA. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace
areas designated as transition areas for airports are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace designated as a surface area for an airport and to modify the 700 foot transition area. An Automated Weather
Observing System has been installed at Lompoc Municipal Airport meeting the criterion for a Class E surface area.
The coordinates for this airspace are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designated as a surface area
for an airport is published in Paragraph 6002 and Class E airspace designations for airspace extending upward from
700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that
this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine
amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5363), FDA published an ANPRM announcing the agency's intent to take several related actions
to reduce the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients. The ANPRM requested
information on whether the specifications it is considering are feasible, and if they are not, why higher levels will
not endanger the public health, and what levels are feasible. Interested persons were given until May 5, 1994, to provide
comments and information in response to the ANPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has received a request to extend the comment period to permit at least an additional 90 days for public comment.
The request stated that additional time is needed to undertake testing, analysis, and data collection relating to
the ANPRM. The request also asked that the extension be granted as quickly as possible, so that the requester can determine
whether there will be adequate time to perform testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for
interested persons to submit comments and information relating to the ANPRM. Accordingly, FDA is extending the comment
period to August 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before August 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this ANPRM. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 515(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)(1)) establishes the requirement
that a preamendments device that FDA has classified into class III is subject to premarket approval. Section 515(b)(2)(A)
of the act provides that a proceeding for the promulgation of a final rule to require premarket approval shall be initiated
by publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proposed rule to require premarket approval for a preamendments device is made final, section 501(f)(2)(B)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(f)(2)(B)) requires that a PMA or notice of completion of a PDP for any such device be filed within
90 days of the date of promulgation of the final rule or 30 months after final classification of the device under section
513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c), whichever is later. If a PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is not filed by the later of
the two dates, commercial distribution of the device is required to cease. The device may, however, be distributed
for investigational use if the manufacturer, importer, or other sponsor of the device complies with the investigational
device exemption (IDE) regulations. The act does not permit an extension of the 90-day period after promulgation
of a final rule within which an application or a notice is required to be filed.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3436), FDA published a proposed rule to require the filing, under section 515(b) of the act
(21 U.S.C. 360e(b)), of PMA's for the classified silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis and all
substantially equivalent devices. In accordance with section 515(b)(2)(A) of the act, FDA included in the preamble
to the proposal the agency's proposed findings regarding: (1) The degree of risk of illness or injury designed to be
eliminated or reduced by requiring the device to meet the premarket approval requirement of the act, and (2) the benefits
to the public from use of the device (58 FR 3436 at 3438). The following is a summary of those findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The envelope or shell of the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis is made of silicone rubber. Accordingly, prolonged
contact with the prosthesis raises the same questions about the potential risks for adverse immunological effects
and/or connective tissue disorders that have been asked with regard to the use of silicone gel-filled breast prostheses
and silicone injections. In addition, no satisfactory, independent data base has been compiled to serve as a basis
for the thorough evaluation of the chronic toxic effects and the possible teratogenic effects of silicone. Lastly,
neither particles which may shed from the silicone shell, nor the chemical forms of silicone monomers or other additives
which may leach from the shell, have yet been adequately characterized with regard to metabolism, distribution,
and excretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most common risk associated with breast augmentation and reconstruction is fibrous capsular contracture, the
formation of a constricting fibrous layer around the prosthesis. Capsular contracture may result in excessive breast
firmness, discomfort, pain, disfigurement, and/or displacement of the implant. Deflation of the implant is another
risk associated with use of the device. Deflation, which results from partial or total loss of the contents due to puncture,
rupture, or other failure of the shell, or a faulty valve, results in the loss of shape of the prosthesis, and often requires
surgical intervention to correct. Lastly, the presence of any breast prosthesis may interfere with standard mammography
procedures used to screen patients for breast cancer. By compressing overlying breast tissue, the presence of the
implant makes it more difficult to detect small tumors. In addition, the presence of the implant can produce a shadow
on the radiograph that may reduce visual clarity of a significant portion of the breast.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether performed for reconstruction or augmentation purposes, breast prosthesis implantation is a discretionary,
elective surgical procedure performed for its psychological benefits. Several studies have been published that
show psychological improvement in both reconstruction and augmentation patients; however, these studies did not
use objective, standardized methodologies that have been validated for measuring the psychological benefit of
the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis is currently the only device legally available for breast
augmentation. For breast reconstruction, the current legal restrictions on the use of silicone gel-filled implants
limit their use to those cases where the silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis is considered medically
unsatisfactory.

III. Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the available scientific evidence and comments received on the proposed rule, FDA has concluded that PMA's
will need to be submitted and evaluated for the silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis. However,
the agency has also determined that a public hearing is warranted to assist the agency in determining when to issue
a final rule to require the filing of PMA's for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda for the hearing will include: (1) An overview by FDA of the statutory procedure for requesting the submission
of PMA's for preamendment class III devices; (2) a presentation by FDA on the preclinical and clinical studies that
are required to be completed to support a PMA for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis; (3) oral testimony by
the manufacturers on the status of their scientific studies, including their prospective clinical studies, and
the scheduled timeframe for completion of those studies; and (4) oral testimony by consumers and/or representatives
of consumer and health professional organizations to assist the agency in determining when to require the filing
of PMA's for the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis. To the extent possible, oral testimony should address the
following issues:

of the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis fulfills an important patient need that would otherwise be unmet if
the device was no longer commercially available or restricted in its availability?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do you believe that FDA should distinguish between use of the device for breast reconstruction versus use for augmentation
purposes in its regulation of the silicone inflatable breast prosthesis?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service proposes changes in several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning bulk and presort
mailing fees and the methods of paying postage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the terms of application of bulk and presort mailing
fees on First-, third-, and fourth-class mail, by requiring payment of the fee only by the party entering the mail,
regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used as the device for postage payment
on the mailing. A single fee payment would allow mailing at all bulk or presort rate categories of the corresponding
class of mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and
Circulation, generally to allow publication anytime during October of the filing year rather than in a specific issue.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P040 is amended both to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently
the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information
about such mailings. Generally, mailers will be allowed to use a company style imprint without having to obtain permits
at two or more post offices, but mailers will be required to show a return address at which records of the mailing will
be made available upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Generally, the new standards allow
for more creativity while retaining restrictions that ensure that the indicia content is readable and clearly identifiable
as postage payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miscellaneous other changes are made for consistency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice presents revisions to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards suggested during the DMM revision project
begun in 1992. DMM Issue 46 (July 1993) was the first result of that project, but was not intended to make changes simultaneously
in substantive mailing requirements; such amendments were deferred for subsequent action such as this rulemaking.
This notice focuses on several matters related to the use of permit imprints (for First-, third-, and fourth-class
mail) and to the method of paying postage for second-class mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. E110.6.1, E312.2.6, and E411.4.0 are amended to standardize the assessment of bulk or presort mailing fees on First-,
third-, and fourth-class mail. Existing standards brought forward from DMM Issue 45 and earlier are inconsistent
with one another. A single standard applies to all First-Class (and Priority) Mail_that a fee must be paid once each
12-month period by any person or organization entering mail at other than the single-piece rates. Payment of that
fee allows use of any presort or bulk First-Class rate and the mailing of both the payer's mail and that of its clients.
By contrast, third-class standards distinguish between postage-affixed (precanceled and meter stamp) and permit
imprint mailers. Fourth-class presents its standards yet another way. Understandably this variation confuses
both customers and postal employees and may cause fees to be assessed incorrectly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision below amends the standards cited earlier to state them uniformly for all three classes: The mailing fee
applicable to the particular class of mail must be paid once each 12-month period at each office of mailing (except
as provided otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) by any person or organization entering mailings of that
class at other than a single-piece or nonpresorted rate, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit,
or meter was used to pay postage on the mail; payment of the one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own
mail (and that of its clients) at all the bulk or presort rates available in the corresponding class of mail. By this
revision, the Postal Service believes that confusion over this type of fee payment should be effectively eliminated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. E213.4.3 is amended to change the publishing requirements for Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management,
and Circulation. The current standard requires each publisher of a second-class publication to file Form 3526 by
October 1 of each year for each authorized publication. The information on that form (or a facsimile of the form) must
be published in the first issue after October 1 of the corresponding general or requester second-class publication.
Publishers have asked that this specification be relaxed to offer more latitude on the issue in which the information
may appear. Because 39 U.S.C. 3685 allows the Postal Service the authority to administer such details as when the form
is filed or published, the Postal Service believes it can change those criteria without adversely affecting the informational
value of what is published. The Postal Service sees no benefit from retaining a stringent requirement when a reasonable
relaxation is sought and supported by the industry. Therefore, the cited standard is amended as shown below to clarify
its applicability and require publication of Form 3526 in any issue published during October. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. P040 is amended to relax the conditions under which a company permit imprint may be used and to strengthen concurrently
the Postal Service's ability both to identify the place of mailing of company permit imprint mail and to obtain information
about such mailings. Current standards require a permit imprint indicium to contain the mailer's permit number and
the name of the post office where the permit is held unless, for a mailer having permit imprint authorizations at two
or more post offices, a ``company'' style indicium is used. In a company style indicium, the name of the permit holder
is substituted for the permit number and post office name. This style is preferred and used extensively by customers
who produce large mailings for entry at multiple sites, who may change printers or mailers regularly, who purchase
large quantities of envelope stock, or who simply prefer the appearance of the company style over the basic format.
Customers who have no need for multiple permit imprint authorizations have noted that it is a pointless burden on the
Postal Service and its customers to generate and maintain a second permit imprint account simply to gain access to
the company style indicium. These customers have requested relaxation of the applicable standards to let any permit
holder use the company style format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current standards also require that company permit imprint mailpieces bear a complete domestic return address,
but do not specify what that address is to represent. Consequently, the Postal Service has found it difficult to trace
such mailpieces back to the point of mailing in situations where classification or postage matters have been questioned.
Moreover, no remedies exist for instances in which the permit holder deliberately frustrates the Postal Service's
efforts to identify the point of mailing, what was mailed, and whether the correct postage was paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, P040 is amended as shown below to allow use of a company style permit imprint indicium by any permit mailer
regardless of the number of permits held. The Postal Service is also requiring more information to document company
permit imprint mailings (and mailings including company permit imprint pieces), is specifying the required return
address, and is enhancing its administrative remedies when the permit holder fails to supply mailing or permit use
information on the request of the Postal Service. No additional record-keeping responsibilities are being added
for either the mailer or the local post office. Rather, it is proposed that mailers use the location (the permit holder's
or its agent's) at which records for the mailing will be available to the Postal Service on request as the required return
address. The revised standards allow suspension or revocation of permits if such records are not provided in a timely
manner. The Postal Service believes the higher standards are a prudent administrative control and do not represent
an unreasonable condition: each permit holder should be able to detail what was mailed, where, and how much postage
was paid, and should have no legitimate reason to withhold such details from the Postal Service. Postal Service actions
against fraudulent uses of permits should be enhanced by these proposed measures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Current standards allow use of
only the formats illustrated in the DMM_basically a plain box with plain lettering. While this format was adequate
for years, contemporary marketing techniques and competitive pressures among mail users have made the attractiveness
of the mailpiece a cornerstone of efforts to interest the addressee in what is inside the mailpiece. As a result, mailers
have become more interested in using artistic latitude in designing the permit imprint indicium that appears on the
mailpiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service understands the mailer interest in this matter and accepts the validity of proposals for greater
design flexibility. However, those must be balanced against the needs of the Postal Service to maintain the clear
recognition of the indicium both as evidence of postage payment and as an indicator of the mailer's identity. Therefore,
P040 is amended as shown below to allow some greater flexibility in the preparation of permit imprint indicia. Generally,
the proposed standard reinforces the distinctiveness of an indicium but allows its incorporation into a design of
the mailer's choice. The combined design must be in a prescribed area of the upper right corner of the address side,
area, or label on the mailpiece, must not imitate a stamp or meter impression, and must keep the indicia free of words
and other printing not specified by the format standards. While some mailers may prefer more latitude, the Postal
Service believes the proposed standards grant significant new flexibility to mailpiece designers in a reasonable
balance between such flexibility and the Postal Service's legitimate interest in maintaining recognizable permit
indicia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. Key rates basically represent a simplified method of
computing zone-rate postage on issues of second-class publications having a stable distribution pattern. Publishers
and others who provided the Postal Service with suggestions for simplifying these regulations noted the diminishing
use of key rates in an era of centralized postage, electronic funds transfer, multiple editions, and other industry
changes. At the same time, postal personnel, noting how seldom key rates are used and the resulting lessening of understanding
and experience in their administration, agreed that their continued availability should be questioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, by the revision shown below, the Postal Service proposes to end the use of key rates. No new users would be
added after September 30, 1994, or on adoption of a final rule, whichever is later, and, to allow for an orderly transition
for remaining key rate users, termination of key rates would be deferred until March 31, 1995, or 6 months after adoption
of a final rule, whichever is later. The Postal Service recognizes that there are some publishers that may still use
key rates and does not wish to impact them more than necessary. However, the Postal Service, which also recognizes
the need to eliminate nonessential regulations if the mailing community is to be better served, feels that key rates
exemplify a potential for such action.

otherwise for plant-verified drop shipments) by any person or organization entering mailings at any regular or special
bulk third-class rate, regardless of whose permit imprint, precanceled stamp permit, or meter was used to pay postage
on the mail. Payment of one fee allows that person or organization to enter its own mail (and that of its clients) at all
the third-class bulk rates. [Delete 2.7; renumber 2.8 through 2.10 as 2.7 through 2.9, respectively.]

for refusal to provide information about permit imprint use or mailings, or for any noncompliance with the standards
applicable to using permit imprints. If revocation is for nonuse but the permit holder plans to resume mailings within
a 90-day period, the permit may be continued for 90 days. The permit holder may appeal the revocation in writing to the
postmaster within 10 days of receipt of the notice. Further appeal may be made through the postmaster to the district
manager of customer service and sales or to the RCSC if the initial decision was made at the district level.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A company permit imprint is one in which the exact name of the company or individual holding the permit is shown in the
permit imprint indicium in place of the city, state, and permit number. A customer may use a company permit imprint
indicium if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For 2 years after the last date of mailing, the permit holder keeps records for each mailing paid by company permit
imprint for USPS review on request. These records include (for each version of what was mailed, if applicable) a complete
sample mailpiece; the weight of a single piece; the total number of pieces mailed; the total postage; the date(s) and
post office(s) of mailing, and other records required by the rate of postage claimed or the method of payment used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Each mailpiece bears the complete domestic return address of the mailer or the mailer's agent, that address being
the physical location at which the records listed in 3.5a are available for USPS review. On unendorsed bulk third-class
mail, the return address may be below the permit imprint.

4.1&blank;Basic Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless prepared under the option in 4.2, permit imprint indicia for ordinary mail, official mail, and Mailgrams must
be prepared in one of the formats shown in Exhibit 4.1a, Exhibit 4.1b, and Exhibit 4.1c, as applicable to the rate claimed
or type of mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.2&blank;Optional Format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit imprint indicia may be prepared in a format other than the basic format described in 4.1 subject to these conditions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The rule that forms a box around the content of the indicium may be omitted if the content remains as specified in 3.0
and Exhibits 4.1a-c. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The indicium content specified in 3.0 is placed within a clear area no smaller than 1/2 inch high and 1/2 inch wide,
no more than 1-1/2 inches below or left from the upper right corner of the mailpiece, of the address label, or of the address
area, regardless of the processing category or the postage rate claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. No printing appears in the indicium area other than the information required or allowed under 3.0. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. No printing appears above or to the right of the permit information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The permit information is printed in no smaller than 4-point type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Any decorative designs intended to be part of the permit imprint indicium design appear below or to the left of the
permit information in an area extending no farther than 4-1/2 inches to the left of the right edge, and 1-1/2 inches
below the top edge, of the mailpiece, address area, or address label, as applicable. Such designs must not resemble
or imitate a postage meter imprint, postage stamp, postcard postage, or other method of postage payment. No words
or symbols are included in a decorative design used by the USPS to identify a class of mail, rate of postage, or level
of service, unless such words or symbols are correctly used under the applicable standards for the mailpiece on which
they appear and the corresponding postage and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 21, 1994 (59 FR 13294), EPA proposed a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act to require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing
of refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) in any new product form not listed, or any new application of an existing product
form not listed in the proposed rule. Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before April 20,
1994. EPA received a request from a trade association seeking a 30&hyph;day extension of the public comment period
because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information on uses not listed in the proposal. EPA believes
that providing an additional 30&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. EPA is therefore reopening
the comment period 30 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written comments
must be received on or before June 3, 1994.

: In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act to prohibit
the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing sinkers.
Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before May 9, 1994. EPA received requests seeking a 60&hyph;day
extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information it requested
in the proposed rule. EPA believes that providing an additional 60&hyph;day comment period to prepare written comments
is reasonable. EPA is therefore extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity
to comment fully. Written comments must be received by EPA on or before July 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed
rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential
version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim
information confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some
other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only
to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket
without further notice to that person.

The Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking initiating a comprehensive review of the performance of local
exchange carriers under price cap regulation. The Commission pledged to undertake this fourth-year review when
it adopted price cap regulation for the Regional Bell Operating Companies, GTE, and electing local exchange carriers.
A motion for extension of time was filed on March 30, 1994, by the United States Telephone Association and granted by
the Commission on April 7, 1994. This notice serves to grant all local exchange carriers additional time in which to
file comments and replies on the issues set forth in the above-cited NPRM.

By the Acting Chief, Common Carrier Bureau:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On March 30, 1994, the United States Telephone Association (USTA) filed a motion for extension of time to file comments
in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 in the above-captioned proceeding. Comments are scheduled to be filed by April 18, 1994 and replies by May 17, 1994.
USTA seeks an extension until May 9, 1994 for comments and until June 8, 1994 for replies.

2. USTA states that the Commission has requested that interested parties submit detailed information and quantitative
data on a wide variety of issues, ranging from the broad policy goals underlying the price cap plan, to specific details
of the plan, to transition issues related to increasing competition in access markets. USTA indicates that it is the
principal trade association representing the entire local exchange carrier industry and views this proceeding
as critically important to determining the future of the telecommunications industry. USTA asserts that the quantification
and other analyses that it will be submitting cannot be completed in time for inclusion in comments to be filed on April
18. Therefore, it argues, an extension of time is necessary for USTA to gather and analyze relevant data and to allow
its consultants to prepare their reports and obtain the approval of USTA's membership before those reports can be
incorporated in its comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Common Carrier Bureau has reviewed USTA's request for extension of time and has determined that good cause has
been shown to grant all interested parties additional time, until May 9, 1994, to file comments and until June 8, 1994
to file reply comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Therefore, it is ordered that the United States Telephone Association's motion for extension of time is granted
to the extent specified herein.

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice to the public that it will be developing regulations that
will clarify, update, and add to existing regulations for the administration of special use permits (permits) on
national wildlife refuges (refuges) in Alaska. These changes will include but not be limited to: Permit application,
denial, and appeal procedures; permit fees; and the process for issuing permits where a competitive selection process
is used to select the permit holder (e.g., big game guide-outfitters).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) (43 U.S.C. 1602&hyph;1784), the National Wildlife
Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd&hyph;668ee), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16
U.S.C. 460k&hyph;460k&hyph;4) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe regulations as necessary to
administer permits for compatible activities on refuges in Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations governing issuance of permits on refuge units in Alaska, codified at 50 CFR 36.41, were originally
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 46 FR 40192 on August 7, 1981, and later amended at 51 FR 44794 on December 12, 1986. Since that time, the permit administration
program on refuges in Alaska has continued to evolve. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to provide up-to-date
guidance to both commercial users and Service employees for the administration of permits in Alaska. Prior to promulgating
these revised regulations, the Service will be reviewing its existing permit administration program and will be
proposing revisions based on over 12 years of experience with the program and the implementation of ANILCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evolution of the program for administering permits has been influenced by a number of factors since the original
regulations were promulgated. One factor has been the increased public awareness and understanding of the need for
securing permits prior to engaging in many activities on refuges in Alaska.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor is the November 1984 Inspector General's Audit Report that found that the Service was not collecting
fees which were commensurate with the value of the commercial activities authorized. This audit resulted in the Service
developing a fee schedule based on client use days instead of charging a fixed $100 administrative fee for all permits
regardless of the scope of income generated by the commercial permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another event causing a significant impact on refuge permit administration in Alaska was the decision of the Alaska
Supreme Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Owsichek 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State Guide Licensing and Control Board, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
763 P.2d 488 (Alaska, 1988). That ruling found the State's system of assigning exclusive guide areas unconstitutional.
Prior to this ruling, the Service had depended upon the State's system for selecting and assigning guides to areas
which were located within refuge lands. In an attempt to allow the State an opportunity to develop a constitutionally
acceptable system, and one which would satisfy Service needs, the Service imposed a moratorium on the issuance of
permits to new guide applicants. This effectively limited the availability of permits to those who were guiding at
the time of the 1988 court ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After some time, the Service decided to develop its own interim program in order to provide an equal opportunity for
all registered big game guide-outfitters to compete for permits. During late 1991 and early 1992, the Service proposed
an interim system to select big game guide-outfitters. After soliciting public comment on the system, and making
revisions based on substantive comments, an interim program was implemented in June 1992. Requests for proposals
were then solicited and applicants were notified of selections in January 1993. Successful applicants were awarded
5-year permits effective July 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It now appears that the State may not be able to implement a satisfactory system for the selection of guide-outfitters
prior to the expiration of the 5-year permits the Service issued in 1993. Accordingly, the Service proposes to initiate
development of regulations related to the big game guide-outfitter program and include them in the revised regulations
pertaining to the general administration of permits in Alaska (50 CFR 36.41). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has identified several issues at this preliminary stage for which it invites public comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is the existing 180 day period allowed for filing appeals of adverse decisions on permits appropriate in this instance?
Should a separate appeal system be developed which speaks directly to big game guide-outfitters? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To what extent should the existing interim system for selecting big game guide-outfitters be made part of the regulations?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the State develops a selection system that meets Service requirements, should provision be made for the suspension
of the Service permit selection system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the foregoing issues, as well as other related aspects of this process, are encouraged. The Service will
follow this comment period with the publication of a proposed rule which will allow, also, for additional comments
prior to publication of a final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS proposes regulations to implement several management measures designed to prevent some Gulf of Alaska (GOA)
trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the GOA halibut bycatch limit; amend the directed fishing
standards to prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed
fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed
to directed fishing; change the opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries in the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) from May 1 to January 1; and implement changes pertaining to the annual
specification and management of GOA halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. This action is necessary to reduce
the likelihood that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch
limit established for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish
under halibut bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives
of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
of Commerce in accordance with the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish
Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the
U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its September 1993 meeting, the Council requested NMFS to prepare a rulemaking that would implement several management
measures that are intended to prevent some GOA trawl fisheries from taking an unnecessarily large share of the halibut
bycatch limit relative to other groundfish trawl fisheries. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch
cap before some groundfish total allowable catches (TACs) have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations
in the GOA even though the full groundfish harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries. These measures were
presented to the Council in September 1993 by GOA and BSAI trawl industry representatives as an alternative to FMP
amendments under consideration by the Council that would establish a super-exclusive registration program for
vessels participating in the GOA and BSAI groundfish fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three measures were proposed to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already
established for the trawl gear fisheries (&sect;672.20(f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water
fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'');
and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and rockfish);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards
(&sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder,
or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other,
more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a
result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species
at &sect;675.20(h)(2) are also revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its December 1993 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS implement these measures early in the 1994 fishing year
by emergency interim rulemaking. An emergency rule was issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222) under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed description of, and justification for, each of the proposed management measures, including editorial
changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch limits, follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishment of Two GOA Trawl Categories for Purposes of Apportioning the Halibut Bycatch Mortality Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing regulations at &sect;672.20(f) establish a framework process for the annual specification of separate
Pacific halibut PSC limits for ``trawl'' and ``fixed gear'' fisheries, and for apportioning those limits by season.
Although these regulations limit the bycatch of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have
resulted in conflict among, and preemption of, groundfish trawling operations in the GOA as various trawl fishery
components compete for shares of the available halibut PSC limit. This conflict occurs due to seasonal variations
in halibut bycatch rates and amounts of halibut caught in the various trawl fisheries; NMFS lacks regulatory authority
to apportion the halibut PSC limit among separate trawl fishery categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under existing regulations, the possibility exists for the activities of one group of trawl vessels fishing for a
particular groundfish species or species complex to take a disproportionate amount of the halibut PSC limit relative
to other groundfish fisheries. The halibut PSC limit may be reached before the attainment of the fisheries' TAC amount
and cause closure of all trawling operations in the GOA, except for trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear. Such
closures may cause: significant amounts of economically important TAC to remain unharvested; idling of vessels
and crew; and, a disruption of processing, fishing support sectors, fishery-dependent communities, and intermediate
and final markets. Even if the total trawl PSC limit is not reached prematurely, the threat that it may be reached at
any point in the fishing year can force other user groups to incur unnecessary costs, alter fishing plans, or operate
in a manner that causes conflict among user groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the potentially adverse impacts of the present process used to manage halibut bycatch in the GOA trawl fisheries
could be avoided or reduced if the GOA trawl PSC limit were apportioned between competing fishery categories. Fishery
data from the GOA trawl fisheries indicate that the variation in halibut bycatch rates and associated bycatch mortality
in these fisheries appears to be relatively well demarcated by the following operational categories: (1) Those vessels
fishing for species in the ``shallow-water species complex'' (pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead
sole, Atka mackerel, or ``other species''); and (2) those vessels fishing for species in the ``deep-water species
complex'' (sablefish, rockfish, deep water flatfish, and arrowtooth flounder). The Council's recommended management
measure included flathead sole in the deep-water complex; however, 1993 fishery data show that more than 65 percent
of the total GOA flathead sole harvest was associated with fisheries in the shallow-water complex. Therefore, NMFS
proposes to include flathead sole in the shallow-water complex. In general, the shallow-water and deep-water complexes
are associated with inshore and offshore trawl operations, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on Council recommendations at its September and December 1993 meetings, NMFS proposes to apportion the 1994
GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries and seasons as set out below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apportionment of the 2,000 metric ton (mt) halibut bycatch mortality limit established for the 1994 GOA trawl fisheries
among the shallow and deep-water trawl fishery complexes and seasons. Seasons open and close at 12 noon, Alaska local
time (A.l.t.), except that the first season opens at 0001 hours, A.l.t., January 20, and the last season ends at 12 midnight,
A.l.t., December 31.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attainment of a seasonal (quarterly) bycatch allowance by a fishery complex would result in directed fishing closures
for each species within that fishery complex for the remainder of the quarter, except that when the halibut bycatch
allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for the shallow-water complex is reached, directed fishing
for pollock with pelagic trawl gear may continue subject to other regulatory provisions under &sect;672.20(f).
Any overages or shortfalls of a quarterly bycatch allowance would be accounted for in the subsequent quarterly allowance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed justification for the fishery and seasonal apportionments of the 1994 halibut PSC limit is described in
the EA prepared for this management measure (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These apportionments are intended to accommodate seasonal bycatch requirements in a manner that optimizes the
1994 halibut PSC limit established for trawl gear relative to anticipated trawl fishing patterns and 1994 groundfish
TACs.

Revision of the Methodology Used To Calculate Retainable Amounts of Groundfish Under Directed Fishing Standards

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule amends &sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i) to address problems with the current regulatory provisions
for calculation of ``retainable'' bycatch amounts of groundfish species for which directed fishing is closed. Current
regulations provide for an overly liberal computation of retainable amounts of groundfish bycatch species, because
the basis for bycatch retention inappropriately includes species not open for directed fishing. This compromises
the purpose of using directed fishing standards to restrict bycatch of species after directed fishery closures.
This also creates a circular process, effectively allowing excessive bycatch retention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An associated concern exists that operators of some vessels deliberately target on arrowtooth flounder merely to
provide a basis for retaining allowable amounts of highly valued groundfish species for which directed fishing is
closed. In this case, arrowtooth flounder is harvested solely for the purpose of providing ``directed catch'' against
which ``retainable bycatch'' quantities may be calculated and accumulated. The arrowtooth flounder directed catch
is discarded and only the economically valuable bycatch, authorized on the basis of the quantity of the arrowtooth
harvest, is actually retained for processing. This practice effectively subverts the ``bycatch only'' intent of
fishery closures and associated directed fishing standards at &sect;672.20(g) and &sect;675.20(h). Furthermore,
trawl operations for arrowtooth flounder experience relatively high bycatch rates of halibut and, thus, contribute
to premature attainment of the halibut PSC limit, further aggravating the competition for the halibut PSC limit in
the GOA trawl fisheries and increasing the potential for costly trawl fishery closures.

Adjustment of Season Opening Dates for the BSAI Flatfish Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would adjust the opening date for the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1
to January 1. The purpose of this season adjustment is to provide the BSAI trawl industry with viable fishing alternatives;
reduce the need for, and likelihood of, significant movement of fishing capacity from the BSAI to the GOA; reduce competition
for the halibut PSC limit established for the GOA trawl fisheries; and reduce the likelihood that displacement of
Bering Sea trawl effort into the GOA may preempt fishing opportunities for GOA operations later in the fishing year
by exhausting the GOA trawl halibut PSC limit, thus necessitating GOA-wide trawl closures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original purpose for delaying directed fishing for yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' species until May 1
was to prevent the joint venture processing (JVP) and domestic annual processing (DAP) fisheries from taking a disproportionate
share of their respective red king crab or halibut bycatch allowances established for Bycatch Limitation Zones 1
or 2H (defined at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;675.2), before available amounts of yellowfin sole and other groundfish species were harvested. Early attainment
of red king crab or halibut bycatch allowances due to of high bycatch rates experienced in the early spring flatfish
fisheries resulted in premature fishery closures that prevented available amounts of flatfish and other groundfish
species from being harvested. Delaying the opening of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries until
May 1 allowed the DAP fisheries to utilize the bulk of the available Zone 1 PSC limits in the rock sole and Pacific cod
fisheries from January through April, optimizing their catch of allocated groundfish species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The flatfish fisheries have changed substantially since the May 1 starting date was implemented. JVP fisheries no
longer operate in the EEZ off Alaska. The domestic industry has developed profitable new markets for products from
the ``other flatfish'' complex. In addition, the yellowfin sole and rock sole/''other flatfish'' fisheries are
allocated separate bycatch allowances that may be seasonally apportioned to optimize the groundfish harvest within
the established prohibited species bycatch restrictions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The May 1 opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries now has the effect of preventing domestic
fishermen from harvesting these resources at the beginning of the fishing year, when few other fishing opportunities
exist. This season has contributed, for example, to a situation in which the available TAC for the ``other flatfish''
complex has been underutilized in recent years. In 1991, only about 47 percent of the TAC for this species group was
harvested. In 1992 and 1993, that figure was 38 percent and 45 percent, respectively. Nonetheless, while these resources
have been underutilized, despite an expressed interest in accessing them at the beginning of the fishing year, retention
of the May 1 opening has forced BSAI trawl fishermen either to move into the GOA deep-water flatfish fishery, which
opens in January, or cease fishing until May 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rock sole fishery in the Bering Sea currently opens at the beginning of the fishing year to allow fishing in the lucrative
``roe'' fishery. This fishery typically closes in late February or early March when the rock sole have finished spawning.
Seasonal halibut bycatch restrictions can close other fisheries (e.g., Pacific cod during 1991 and 1992), leaving,
as noted above, few alternative fishing opportunities for the BSAI groundfish fleet. Flathead sole, one of the species
in the Bering Sea ``other flatfish'' category, produce roe that matures just after rock sole roe matures. Markets
for roe-bearing flathead sole have emerged, making this fishery a natural extension of that for roe-bearing rock
sole in the Bering Sea. Other markets for these flatfish species, including a domestic fillets market, are under development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opening the BSAI yellowfin sole fishery and the ``other flatfish'' fishery at the beginning of the fishing year (January
1) would provide vessels operating in the Bering Sea with the opportunity to participate in a potentially profitable,
developing fishery. This opportunity is expected to reduce the need for vessels to move into the GOA trawl fisheries
early in the fishing year, and thus would decrease pressure on the GOA halibut PSC limit and diminish the probability
of preemption of existing GOA groundfish fisheries through early closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend the directed fishing standard for flatfish species (&sect;675.20(h)(2)) to accommodate
this season change and allow sufficient bycatch amounts of rock sole, yellowfin sole, arrowtooth flounder, or ``other
flatfish'' in the flatfish fisheries, while allowing for fishing operations to minimize the discard waste of these
species. The proposed rule would also establish species-specific standards, rather than aggregate standards,
for all flatfish species closed to directed fishing. The intent of this action is to simplify directed fishing standards,
and to reduce discard waste by increasing the retainable amounts of flatfish species closed to directed fishing relative
to other flatfish species that are open to directed fishing.

NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. All vessels using trawl gear
to harvest BSAI or GOA groundfish and processors receiving trawl-caught groundfish could be affected by the management
measures proposed under this action. Most catcher vessels harvesting groundfish off Alaska meet the definition
of a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In 1993, 265 catcher vessels were issued permits to harvest
groundfish with trawl gear in Federal waters. All these vessels could be affected due to adjustments in fishing patterns
resulting from (1) changing the season of the BSAI flatfish fisheries, and (2) revising the management of the GOA halibut
PSC limit established for trawl fisheries. These effects are not expected to result in a reduction in annual gross
revenues by more than 5 percent, annual compliance costs that would increase total costs of production by more than
5 percent, or compliance costs for small entities that are at least 10 percent higher than compliance costs as a percent
of sales for large entities. Therefore, the proposed action would not result in a ``significant economic impact''
on small entities under the RFA. A copy of the EA/RIR is available (see

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice solicits comment on proposed revisions of the regulations for assessing natural resource damages resulting
from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act or a release of a hazardous substance under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The Department of the Interior has previously
developed two types of natural resource damage assessment regulations: Standard procedures for simplified assessments
requiring minimal field observation (the type A rule); and site-specific procedures for detailed assessments in
individual cases (the type B rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing, as part of its compliance with a court remand, to revise the type B rule to address the use
of the economic methodology known as contingent valuation to assess lost values of injured natural resources. In
general, the Department is considering and soliciting comment on a proposed natural resource damage assessment
rule regarding contingent valuation recently published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
pursuant to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. This notice constitutes the Department's proposed rulemaking document
and solicits comment on rule language under consideration for a final rule. Upon consideration of the comments received
in response to this notice, the Department intends to issue a final rule. The Department recently published a final
rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all other aspects of the court order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (CERCLA) authorize natural resource trustees to recover compensatory damages for injury to, destruction of, or
loss of natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters or a release of a hazardous substance.
CWA sec. 311(f); CERCLA sec. 107. Federal and State officials may be designated to serve as natural resource trustees
under CERCLA and CWA. CERCLA also recognizes the authority of Indian tribes to commence actions as natural resource
trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries and losses that are not fully remedied by response actions.
All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. Trustee officials may also recover the reasonable costs
of assessing natural resource damages and any prejudgment interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CERCLA requires the promulgation of two types of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting
either from a discharge of oil under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 301(c).
The type A regulations constitute standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation.
The type B regulations constitute site-specific procedures for detailed assessments. Both regulations identify
the best available procedures for determining natural resource damages. Assessments performed by Federal and State
natural resource trustee officials in accordance with these regulations receive a rebuttable presumption in court.
CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department of the Interior
(the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580.

The Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA) was signed into law on August 18, 1990. Among other things, OPA amended
the natural resource damage provisions of CWA. OPA authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) to develop new natural resource damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters.
The Department is coordinating its rulemakings with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent
processes are established for assessing natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. OPA provides that until NOAA
develops final regulations, the Department's regulations may be used to assess natural resource damages under OPA.

B. Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has issued various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug. 1,
1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are
all codified at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule that has not yet been codified in
the Code of Federal Regulations. 59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as technical methods for the actual identification of injuries and calculation of damages. Under the regulations,
both type A and type B, assessments consist of four major phases.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first phase of an assessment conducted under the regulations involves the activities that precede the actual
assessment. For example, upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials
perform a preassessment screen to ascertain whether further assessment actions are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second phase involves the preparation of an Assessment Plan. The Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review
and comment, assists the involvement of other interested trustee officials, potentially responsible parties (PRPs),
and the general public. The Assessment Plan also ensures that assessments are performed at a reasonable cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the third phase, trustee officials conduct the work described in the Assessment Plan. The work involves three steps:
Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials
determine whether any natural resources have been injured. If trustee officials determine that resources have been
injured, they proceed to Quantification, in which they quantify the resulting reduction in services provided by
the resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought
as damages for the natural resource injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a type A assessment, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination
through the use of standardized procedures involving minimal field work. The Department has adopted a phased approach
to developing type A procedures for different environments. Only one type A procedure has been developed to date.
The existing type A procedure provides for the use of a computer model to assess damages from small releases or discharges
in coastal or marine environments. For other releases or discharges, trustee officials conduct a type B assessment,
in which Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination are performed through the use of a range
of alternative scientific and economic valuation methodologies. This notice addresses the use of a particular valuation
methodology during the Assessment Phase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth phase of every natural resource damage assessment, whether the type A or type B rule is followed, consists
of post-assessment activities such as: Preparation of a Report of Assessment; establishment of an account for damage
assessment awards; and development of a Restoration Plan for use of the awards.

C. Judicial Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A party may petition the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any regulation issued under
CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 113(a). A number of parties filed such petitions for review of the natural resource damage assessment
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type B rule was challenged in

 upheld various challenged aspects of the type B rule but did remand three issues. The court ordered the Department
to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource
damages. The court used the term ``restoration costs'' to encompass the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources. 880 F.2d at 441. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court also ordered the Department to allow for the assessment of all reliably calculated lost values of injured
natural resources, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities
such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent on use of the resource. Nonuse values include existence
value, which is the value of knowing that a resource exists, and bequest value, which is the value of knowing that a resource
will be available for future generations. Finally, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural
resource damage assessment regulations apply to natural resources that are not actually owned by the government.

Department reopened the comment period to allow consideration of additional comments, including newly developed
information on the contingent valuation methodology (CV), the only method currently available for the express purpose
of estimating nonuse values. 58 FR 39328. The comment period was originally reopened until September 7, 1993, and
then extended until September 22, 1993. 58 FR 45877 (Aug. 31, 1993).

of CV when used to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department is issuing this notice to ensure that interested parties
have an adequate opportunity for review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all aspects of the

values.

CERCLA mandates biennial review and revision, as appropriate, of the natural resource damage assessment regulations.
The Department plans to begin the biennial update of the type B rule in July 1994. All aspects of the administrative
process and the type B rule will be subject to review during that update. During the biennial review, the Department
will consider ways of ensuring the greatest consistency appropriate between its damage assessment regulations
and the damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, later this year the Department plans to issue a proposed rule to revise the type A rule for coastal and marine
environments in compliance with

A. Costs of Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The type B rule as originally published on August 1, 1986, provided that damages consisted of the lesser of the cost
of restoring the injured resources (plus the lost interim use value) or the diminution in the value of the injured resources
without restoration. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs
as the measure of natural resource damages. CERCLA provides that sums recovered in natural resource damage actions
may be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court
used the simple term ``restoration'' costs as shorthand for the cost of performing any of these actions. 880 F.2d at
441. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that revised the type B rule to allow trustee officials
to recover the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources
in all cases. 59 FR 14281. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 25, 1994, final rule provides guidance on projecting the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing,
and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Under that final rule, trustee officials first identify
and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials also estimate those services that are likely to be lost
to the public pending completion of each alternative under consideration. Trustee officials then select one of the
possible alternatives based on several factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan, which is subject to public review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the trustee officials select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative,
they choose the methods they intend to use to estimate the costs of implementing that alternative. To do this, trustee
officials select among specified cost estimating methodologies. Trustee officials include the rationale for their
selection in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Compensable Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the March 25, 1994, final rule, the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent
of the injured resources are the basic measure of damages; however, these costs are only one component of the damages
that trustee officials may assess. Trustee officials also have the discretion to assess the value of the resource
services that the public lost from the date of the release or discharge until completion of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 59 FR 14283. The term ``compensable value'' is used to
encompass all of the lost public economic values, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. The Restoration
and Compensation Determination Plan includes a description of the methodologies trustee officials intend to use
when estimating compensable value during Damage Determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original type B rule provided a ranked list of methodologies that could be used to calculate lost use values. If
the market for the injured resource was ``reasonably competitive,'' then the diminution of the market price attributable
to the discharge or release was used to estimate damages. If a market price methodology was not applicable, then the
trustee officials were required to use appraisal methodologies. Only when neither market-price nor appraisal methodologies
were appropriate for the resources being assessed did the original version of the rule allow trustee officials to
use non-market-based methodologies.

Further, &sect;&sect;11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original version of the type B rule provided that lost
nonuse values could only be assessed if trustee officials could not determine any lost use values. In the August 1,
1986, preamble to the original type B rule, the Department provided the following explanation for this restriction:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ordinarily, option and existence values would be added to use values. However, section 301(c) of CERCLA mentions
only use values. Therefore, the primary emphasis in this section is on the estimation of use values&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
Another related reason for this limitation is that more is known about the determination of use values than option
and existence values. Option and existence values are less well-defined and more uncertainty surrounds their measurement.

calculate lost use values and use of CV to calculate lost nonuse values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 25, 1994, final rule leaves trustee officials free to choose among the listed valuation methodologies,
including CV, when estimating lost use values. 59 FR 14285&hyph;86. The final rule provides a number of criteria to
guide the selection of valuation methodologies, including a requirement that the chosen methodologies are reliable
for the particular incident and type of damage being measured. The final rule renumbers &sect;&sect;11.83(b)(2)
and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original rule, which restrict the assessment of lost nonuse values to cases where lost
use values cannot be determined, as new &sect;&sect;11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B), respectively.

III. Contingent Valuation: Discussion and Rule Language Under Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CV is a survey-based approach to the valuation of nonmarket goods and services that relies on a questionnaire for the
direct elicitation of information about the value of the good or service in question. The value obtained for the good
or service is said to be contingent upon the nature of the constructed (hypothetical or simulated) market and the good
or service described in the survey scenario. In the natural resource damage assessment context, CV studies generally
derive values through elicitation of respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) to prevent injuries to natural resources
or to restore injured natural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first published CV study, valuing outdoor recreation, appeared in 1963. There are now over 1,400 documented papers,
reports, and books on CV. In recent years, CV has become one of the most widely used methods of nonmarket valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four basic elements common to CV questionnaires are: (1) An explanation of the structure and rules of the market in
which the good or service being valued is either bought or sold; (2) a description of the good or service and how it is
to be provided; (3) the value elicitation question; and (4) validation questions to verify comprehension and acceptance
of the scenario and to elicit socioeconomic and attitudinal characteristics to interpret the variation in responses
to the valuation question across respondents. There are no universal rules on how each of these elements of a CV questionnaire
should be designed, since the appropriate formulation of each depends on the good or service being valued and its context
and, consequently, will vary across applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CV surveys generally measure total value of a good or service, which includes both use values and nonuse values. However,
nonuse values, unlike use values, are not linked to observable behavior and, thus, are more difficult to validate
externally than use values. Therefore, criticisms of CV pertain primarily to its use in valuing the nonuse component
of total value and the difficulty of external validation of that component of total value. Among the most commonly
cited criticisms of CV studies of nonuse values are: The stated intentions of WTP in CV surveys may exceed ``true''
WTP; CV may produce results that appear inconsistent with the tenets of rational choice; respondents to CV surveys
on nonuse may be unfamiliar with the good or service being valued and therefore may not have an adequate basis for articulating
their true value; CV respondents may be expressing a value for the satisfaction (warm glow) of giving rather than the
value of the good or service in question; and respondents may fail to take CV questions seriously because the financial
implications of their responses are not binding. Most proponents of CV acknowledge that poorly designed and administered
CV studies can produce results that reflect the potential problems identified above. However, proponents also assert
that these problems are not inherent to the method and that well-designed and well-executed CV studies can eliminate
them or render them inconsequential. Proponents further assert that survey design, development, and administration
standards will improve quality control for CV surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received many, often conflicting, comments on the use of CV to calculate nonuse values. As the Department
noted in the July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, NOAA convened a panel of economic and survey experts (the NOAA panel), pursuant to its rulemaking authority
under OPA, to evaluate the reliability of CV to measure nonuse values. The NOAA panel issued a report in January, 1993.
58 FR 4601 (Jan. 15, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon consideration of all comments received and the NOAA panel report, the Department is proposing to revise
the type B rule to include standards for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department believes that standards
to improve the reliability of CV surveys of lost nonuse values are needed in the Department's type B rule, because assessments
performed in accordance with the rule will be given a rebuttable presumption in litigation over the specific amount
of money a particular party must pay as compensation for liability. However, this same level of precision for CV surveys
may not necessarily be required for other applications of CV, such as use of CV in regulatory cost-benefit analyses.

On January 7, 1994, NOAA published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under OPA. 59 FR 1062. Section
990.78(b)(5) of NOAA's proposed rule includes standards for the use of CV. 59 FR 1182&hyph;83; see also 59 FR 1142&hyph;48.
In the interest of consistency and after consultation with other Federal agencies, the Department is soliciting
comment on whether the Department's type B rule should be revised to include standards for the use of CV substantially
similar to those proposed by NOAA. Upon consideration of the comments received in response to this notice, the Department
intends to issue a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's proposed standards for use of CV cover five areas: (1) Survey instrument design and development; (2) survey
administration; (3) the nature of the results; (4) calibration; and (5) reporting. NOAA's proposed standards are
intended to provide flexibility to trustee officials so that they can take advantage of new developments that may
occur in CV methodology. Further, any standards included in the Department's type B rule may be subject to amendment
during the statutorily required biennial review of the regulations to reflect the results of new research.

A. Survey Instrument Design and Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reliability of a CV study begins with the design and development of the survey instrument. NOAA has proposed several
survey instrument design and development standards. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards
should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering
for its type B rule, is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Survey instrument design and development_(A) Willingness to pay for Prevention or Restoration. (1) The survey instrument
shall elicit from respondents their willingness-to-pay (WTP) either to prevent described injuries to natural resources
or to restore injured resources as described to their baseline or comparable condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for selecting a prevention program or restoration program as the
commodity to be valued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Commodity definition. (1) During development of the survey, the trustee(s) shall determine whether respondents
understood and found credible the description of the injuries (including whether they are permanent or interim losses)
and the program (including the timing of the process) for preventing injuries or restoring the natural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Prior to the value elicitation, the trustee(s) shall identify the natural resource context of the injured resources,
if related resources exist, including commodities that might serve as substitutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Budget constraints. Prior to the value elicitation, respondents shall be reminded of their budget constraints
and their alternative expenditures. Respondents shall be reminded that their WTP for the environmental program
in question would reduce their expenditures on other goods. This reminder should be more than perfunctory, but less
than overwhelming. The goal is to induce respondents to keep in mind other likely expenditures, including those on
other environmental goods, when evaluating the main scenario. After the value elicitation, respondents shall be
reminded again of their alternative expenditure possibilities. Respondents shall be given an opportunity to reconsider
and change their votes (bid) after this second reminder of alternative expenditure possibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Comparability with real transactions. (1) The survey instrument shall use a credible choice mechanism and payment
vehicle.

(2) The trustee(s) shall select a choice mechanism that is incentive compatible and shall document the rationale
for the selected choice mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The trustee(s) shall ask follow-up questions to determine whether the respondents accepted the choice mechanism
and payment vehicle as credible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (Note: Calibration requirement discussed in Section III.D of this notice)*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Pretesting. (1) Survey development shall include adequate field testing to ensure that the above design criteria
are met. 59 FR 1182&hyph;83. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One important aspect of survey instrument design and development is the selection of a choice mechanism. Past CV studies
have used different methods to elicit values, including open-ended WTP questions; bidding cards; and voting formats
typically termed ``referenda.'' The Department believes that selection of a choice mechanism should be left to the
discretion of trustee officials, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that
the current state of the art shows many advantages for using a voting format as the choice mechanism for CV surveys in
natural resource damage assessments. Therefore, if trustee officials select a choice mechanism other than a voting
format, they should document the factors that led them to reject a voting format. Nevertheless, the Department solicits
comments regarding the incentive compatibility of alternative choice mechanisms and whether the final regulation
or its preamble should state a preference for the voting format. The Department also solicits comments regarding
the administrative and analytical costs associated with alternative choice mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the method of elicitation should be one with which people are familiar and one which provides
a realistic context in which respondents can choose to increase levels of public goods. Local jurisdictions and State
governments often ask voters to increase taxes on themselves so that public goods may be increased (e.g., school bond
issues; special assessments for public infrastructure). Second, in our society, most goods are offered using posted
prices. Asking an individual to reveal his or her maximum WTP for a good is both unfamiliar and unrealistic. Third,
it is important that respondents believe that they will receive the program offered in the CV survey. To CV respondents,
the cost of the program naturally determines the price they must pay. If no set price is offered, the respondents may
perceive uncertainty regarding the program's costs and, therefore, uncertainty regarding the provision of the
program. Finally, the voting format is incentive compatible. Respondents must reveal their preference and vote
for the program if they desire the program at the stated price. Voting against or refusing to vote will only lower the
probability of obtaining the program.

B. Survey Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most carefully designed CV survey can produce unreliable results if the survey administration is faulty. NOAA
has proposed several standards for survey administration. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards
should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering
for its type B rule, is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Survey administration_(A) Sampling procedures. (1) The trustee(s) shall determine the relevant population(s)
to be sampled and document the rationale for that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The trustee(s) shall draw a probability sample(s) from the target population for the administration of the final
survey. Less rigorous sampling is suitable for pretesting and pilot surveys so long as the heterogeneity of the target
population is considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The sample size(s) shall be sufficient to draw statistically significant population inferences and to estimate
WTP valuation functions or to test relevant statistical hypotheses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The trustee(s) shall minimize nonresponse bias to the extent practicable by striving for as high a response rate
in the final survey as possible, consistent with the requirements of reasonable cost. In no case shall the response
rate be less than seventy percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected response rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Mode of administration. (1) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected mode of survey administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If interviewers are used, the survey administration shall be conducted by trained interviewers who are supervised
by experienced interviewer field managers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Regardless of the mode of administration, the trustee(s) shall use an experienced survey research organization
to administer the survey.

(C) Confidentiality. The trustee(s) should ensure respondent confidentiality. 59 FR 1183. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One important aspect of survey administration is the determination of an appropriate response rate. The Department
believes that trustee officials should obtain as high a response rate as possible, consistent with the requirements
of reasonable cost, in order to ensure reliable inferences to the general population. Low response rates pose a risk
of compromising the statistical validity of the survey when nonrespondents have systematically different values
than respondents. Another risk associated with low response rates is that estimates of response variance may be significantly
affected such that the indicated confidence of survey results is questioned. Since the likelihood of these risks
cannot be determined unless nonrespondents have been surveyed, trustee officials should minimize nonresponse
in the final survey to the extent practicable. For example, trustee officials could design the survey instrument
so that individuals must decide whether to respond before the exact nature of the environmental insult is revealed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has proposed that response rates shall not fall below 70 percent. The Department solicits comments on whether
there should be a specified minimum response rate and, if so, whether 70 percent is a reasonable floor. Further, the
Department solicits comments regarding the administrative costs associated with alternative response rates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another important aspect of survey administration is selection of the mode of administration. The three generally
used CV survey administration modes are in-person, mail, and telephone. There are advantages and disadvantages
of each method, and often the selection of the appropriate method is dependent on a number of factors such as cost, turn-around
time, desired response rate, type of information to be conveyed, use of visual aids, required population coverage,
and the ultimate use of the survey results. For example, telephone surveys can approximate simple random sampling
of households through random digit dialing; can produce fast results; are relatively easy to administer; and are
less expensive than in-person interviews. On the other hand, visual aids cannot be used; interviews need to be relatively
short; interviewer bias may be involved; and individuals without telephones are necessarily omitted from the sample.
Self-administered mail surveys are the least costly of the three methods. However, probability sampling is difficult;
respondents can review the survey before deciding to participate (imparting self-selection bias); there can be
no random selection within the household and no control of question sequencing; and a higher number of incomplete
responses are likely to result because there is no interviewer to motivate the respondent. Finally, in-person interviews
permit random selection of the respondent within the household; maintain control of question ordering; allow the
use of visual materials; and generate high response rates. In-person interviews, though, are the most costly method
to administer; require complex field operations; involve the use of many documents and forms (e.g., calling cards,
interviewer evaluation forms, verification forms); and may involve interviewer bias. For a more in-depth discussion
of each method, see EPA, ``Survey Management Handbook,'' vol. II, pp. 24&hyph;35, 230/12&hyph;84&hyph;002, December,
1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that selection of a mode of administration should be left to the discretion of trustee officials,
as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that in-person interviews provide certain
advantages in the natural resource damage assessment context. Therefore, if trustee officials select a mode of administration
other than in-person interviews, they should document the factors that led them to reject in-person interviews.
The Department solicits comments on whether the final regulation or its preamble should state a preference for in-person
interviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While recognizing that mail surveys can provide invaluable information for many academic studies and regulatory
purposes (e.g., the U.S. decennial census), the Department believes that mail surveys at this time lack certain features
that are desirable for use in the natural resource damage assessment context. Telephone surveys also have limitations.
A CV survey designed for natural resource damage assessment purposes is likely to impart a large amount of information
to respondents causing interviews to be lengthy and often complex. In-person interviews offer the opportunity to
motivate the respondents and to hold their interest by providing important information in a graphic and pictorial
format and asking interactive questions regarding the respondents' understanding and acceptance of key features
of the survey instrument. In-person interviews also permit interviewers to record verbatim responses to important
open-ended questions. Such information may be critical in demonstrating that a trustee official has adhered to regulatory
standards for the design and administration of the CV study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also believes that trustee officials should consider the use of modes of administration other than
in-person interviews during the survey instrument development stage. For example, a telephone survey may be an appropriate
and cost-effective method to test a design feature such as question ordering or the understanding of technical terms.
Further, the Department is interested in comparative empirical testing of other administration modes, such as random
digit dialing for initial contacts, followed by mailed descriptive information and visual materials, culminating
with a telephone survey. If such testing demonstrates that other modes can produce the type of information and results
comparable to in-person interviews, the Department would consider encouraging trustee officials to use those methods
for the final survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the mode of administration, the Department believes that all surveys should be administered by a survey
research organization, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. The Department believes that use of a survey research
organization is necessary because the preparation and administration of a general population survey require practical
survey expertise and substantial logistical support. The Department also believes that trustee officials should
select a survey research organization that has implemented procedures to meet the standards outlined in either the
Council of American Survey Research Organizations' Code of Standards for Survey Research or the American Association
for Public Opinion Research's Code of Professional Ethics and Practices. Use of such an organization would help to
maintain reliability and confidentiality. Further, such organizations are likely to have proven track records
and the staff necessary to conduct a survey in accordance with any regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the Department
solicits comments regarding the requirement that surveys be administered by an experienced survey research organization.
Further, comments regarding alternative codes of standards for survey administration are solicited.

C. Nature of Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commonly expressed concern about CV is that it can produce results that are not sensitive to all relevant characteristics
of the described natural resource injuries and methods of preventing or restoring the injured resources. NOAA has
proposed a test to address this concern. The Department solicits comment on whether the same test should be included
in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B
rule, is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Nature of results. (A) Scope test. Controlling for attitudinal, demographic, perceptual, and other differences
across respondents, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate statistically that the aggregate WTP across all respondents
for the prevention or restoration program increases (decreases) as the scope of the environmental insult is expanded
(contracted). The scope of the environmental insult is characterized by the severity of the natural resource injuries
and the level of effectiveness and timing of the restoration or prevention program. The demonstration shall be conducted
through the use of split samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Number of scenarios. The trustee(s) shall administer to split samples different survey instruments containing
three variations of the scope of the environmental insult that respondents perceive as different unless the trustee(s)
can provide a reasonable showing that the three-scenario test is infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack
of plausibility of scenarios. Where three scenarios are feasible, the statistical test shall involve pairwise comparisons.
In either case, the scenarios may vary along any of the margins of intensity, geography, and duration of damage and,
for prevention scenarios, the probability of an event occurring. The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for
the selected variations of the scope of the environmental insult. In determining the descriptions to be used with
the split samples, the trustee(s) shall use realistic injury scenarios and prevention or restoration programs that
the respondents accept as credible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Maximum amount of difference between scenarios. The trustee(s) shall develop scenarios for the total value test.
Prior to the performance of the test, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate that not more than ninety-five percent of respondents
in a pre-test or in focus groups indicate that there are meaningful value differences between the scenarios to be tested
in any pairwise comparison. The demonstration shall be based on a minimum of sixty valid responses. The trustee(s)
shall exclude from this demonstration any individuals who indicate in screening questions that they are not willing
to pay anything for any size environmental cleanup or who would be willing to pay unrealistically large and invariant
amounts for any size environmental cleanup. 59 FR 1183.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this test were included in the Department's type B rule, one important aspect would be the determination of the relevant
dimensions of the scope of the environmental insult. The scope of an environmental insult such as a discharge of oil
or release of a hazardous substance is multi-dimensional, where the dimensions are influenced by biological and
social attributes. A discharge or release can affect all or part of an ecosystem. Its effects can be short- or long-lived,
lethal or sublethal, geographically contained or widely dispersed. From the human perspective, the effects of a
discharge or release may be directly visible and disturbing, or out of sight and perceived only indirectly once there
is knowledge about the loss of natural resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the first phase of NOAA's proposed test, the relevant dimensions of the scope of the discharge or release under investigation
would need to be identified. Once the trustee official had defined the relevant dimensions of scope, the trustee official
would employ a split sampling technique where some respondents were provided with an alternative survey instrument.
The trustee official would begin the analysis with the primary survey instrument that would be used to estimate the
values lost due to the discharge or release in question. This instrument would be designated the base instrument.
Trustee officials would pre-test and perform pilot tests on the instrument to ensure that the instrument met any design
and development standards. Analyses performed using incompletely developed or tested preliminary instruments
would not be considered evaluations of scope sensitivity because in these situations it would not be possible to distinguish
the effects of variations in survey instrument design from the effects of changes in the scope of the injury or proposed
prevention or restoration program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In designing a CV survey instrument, trustee officials would determine the dimensions of scope that were relevant
to the discharge or release under investigation and decide whether there existed a subset of dimensions that were
important to the values being measured or whether all of the dimensions were linked and therefore equally important.
In cases where a subset were deemed important, trustee officials would choose whether to scale these dimensions up
or down in relation to the levels described in the base instrument and by how much to scale the dimensions. If all relevant
dimensions were to be scaled, trustee officials would still decide in which direction and magnitude to scale each
dimension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the trustee officials had decided on the dimensions to be scaled, in what direction and by how much, they would
produce second and third instruments that differed from the base instrument only with respect to the scope dimensions.
Trustee officials could choose to scale dimensions regarding the injury description, dimensions concerning the
prevention or restoration programs offered to respondents, or both. Regardless, trustee officials must take care
to ensure that the expected ordinal change in WTP remains unambiguous when simultaneously scaling different dimensions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope test would be designed to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates. The Department is considering
a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. The first priority in this hierarchy would be to demonstrate the transitivity
of aggregate WTP estimates with respect to the scope of the environmental insult. The second priority would be to demonstrate
the sensitivity of aggregate WTP estimates to both an expansion and a contraction of the environmental insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: One reflecting an expansion of the environmental
insult from that described by the base instrument and the other reflecting a contraction of the environmental insult
from that described by the base instrument. Joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate
WTP estimates were transitive (i.e., A&lt;B and B&lt;C, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that such a test may not be feasible all cases. It may not be feasible in some cases to design
credible alternative instruments reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult.
For those cases, the second most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: Both reflecting either
an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument. Regardless,
joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive (e.g., A&lt;C
and C&lt;B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, it may not be feasible in some cases to determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive
if different dimensions were scaled in the two alternative instruments. For those cases, the third most preferred
test would involve separate pairwise comparisons to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates (e.g.,
A&lt;B and C&lt;B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, it may not be feasible in some cases to design two credible alternative instruments. For those cases, the
test would involve one alternative instrument reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental
insult from that described by the base instrument. This would be the least preferred test. In all cases, trustee officials
would be required to document the rationale for the selected scope test. The Department solicits comments on the need
for and desirability of such a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the scaled instruments were pretested, all three instruments would be employed in a split sample design. Since
inferences to the relevant population would not be part of a scope analysis, true probability sampling would not be
required and convenience samples could be employed so long as random assignment of the different treatments were
maintained. Trustee officials would endeavor to employ large samples in these analyses since changes in scope could
be small and large samples may be needed to attain significant differences in WTP. Trustee officials would be free
to demonstrate sensitivity to scope using statistical techniques of their choosing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The validity of the scope test could depend on the respondents' perception of differences in the scope dimensions
across the three treatments. Trustee officials would include questions that could be used to determine whether respondents
understood and found credible the description of the injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three-scenario approach would not be required when trustee officials provided a reasonable showing that it was
infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack of plausibility of the scenarios. In such circumstances, trustee
officials could perform the analysis using only the original scenario and one alternative scenario. However, as
CV surveys are routinized and their costs fall, trustee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials may find that the three-scenario analysis is feasible in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern has been expressed that differences between the scenarios not be so large that passing the scope test would
be a foregone conclusion, nor so small that it would be very difficult to demonstrate statistical differences without
extremely large (and costly) split samples. The issue is complicated by the possibility, based on the State of Alaska-sponsored
study of the Exxon Valdez spill, that a significant minority of the population may be insensitive to any reasonable
differences in scenarios: Some individuals may not be willing to pay anything for any environmental cleanup, others
may be willing to pay unrealistically high (and invariant) amounts for any size environmental cleanup. In response
to this concern, NOAA has proposed that trustee officials should develop procedures for identifying and eliminating
these responses, so that the demonstration that the scenarios are meaningfully different would rest on the remaining
participants. To accept the scenarios for the scope test, no more than 95 percent of the remaining participants could
indicate that the differences between the scenarios were real and meaningful, i.e. that the values of the respective
commodities differed. The Department is seeking comment on ways to design such a procedure to demonstrate differences
in scenarios, and on alternative schemes to achieve a comparable goal. For example, should ``insensitive'' individuals
be excluded from the survey and, if so, how should such individuals be identified? How should the threshold defining
``meaningful differences'' be characterized? Should the threshold criterion for determining ``meaningful difference''
be adjusted, since individuals impose internal consistency on their answers in the face of direct comparisons (recognizing
much finer differences than in split samples)? Once a procedure has been developed to determine if individuals are
sensitive to the scope of the environmental insult, should this information be incorporated into the selection of
the sample for the scope test? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NOAA's proposed rule would require a split sample with multiple scenarios for demonstrating the scope test,
the Department seeks comment on the option of alternatively using an indirect test to explain variation in WTP as a
function of a set of explanatory variables, including belief in the size of the damage scenario, and/or effectiveness
of the prevention or restoration program. Commenters should consider under what circumstances such an indirect
test should be allowed for performing the scope test. An indirect approach examines the sensitivity to scope indirectly
through the use of a WTP valuation function, relying entirely on the base instrument. In the context of a single dichotomous
choice referendum (or a double-bounded formulation), a WTP valuation function may relate the probability of a yes
vote to a list of variables assumed to underlie the voting decision (e.g., the amount the household is asked to pay,
household demographics, etc.). The indirect approach may expand this list to include variables based on information
collected from respondents that are related to the scope dimensions of the discharge or release. These measures must
be meaningful to the respondent given the information provided in the survey. For example, a useful question following
the WTP elicitation question is one that asks whether the respondent believed the injuries caused by the discharge
or release to be more or less severe than described. All other things being equal (i.e. similar preferences, budget
constraints, etc.), respondents believing the injuries to be worse than described, and having equal confidence
in the prospects for restoring the injured resources through the offered plan, might be willing to pay more. Such a
finding would be an indirect verification of scope sensitivity.

D. Calibration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA has proposed a requirement that trustee officials calibrate WTP values derived from CV studies to ``actual''
WTP. The Department is aware of a number of studies examining the relationship between ``hypothetical'' WTP and ``actual''
WTP. In this work, an effort is made to calibrate hypothetical WTP values derived from CV studies to actual WTP. The
results of this work are not definitive and are based on CV studies of a lower quality survey design than would be required
under NOAA's proposed rule. However, because of uncertainty associated with CV estimates, the Department is soliciting
comment on whether the calibration requirement in NOAA's proposed rule should be included in the Department's type
B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language requiring calibration is as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The survey instrument or analysis method shall provide a factor for calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP. The
trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected calibration factor. If the survey instrument or analysis
method fails to provide such a factor or the trustee(s) fails to document the rationale for the selected factor, actual
WTP shall be presumed to be one-half of stated WTP. 59 FR 1183.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As NOAA's preamble recognizes, the proposed default factor was included for the purpose of soliciting comment. 59
FR 1146.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comment on a number of questions regarding the calibration of CV results. Is a calibration requirement
necessary in light of the other proposed standards for survey instrument design and development, survey administration,
and nature of results? Is a calibration requirement warranted given that, but for the difficulties in elicitation,
willingness to accept (WTA) would be a more appropriate measure of damages than WTP? The economics literature concludes
that, for changes in the provision of a public good, the difference between WTA and WTP depends on the availability
of substitute goods. The fewer substitutes available, the greater the difference between WTA and WTP. See W.M. Hanemann,
``Willingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept: How Much Can They Differ?'' American Economic Review, vol. 81, pp.
635&hyph;647 (1991). This result suggests that WTP may significantly understate WTA, the more appropriate measure
of damages for natural resource injuries. The Department also seeks comment on: The rationale for calibration or
the justification for assuming that hypothetical WTP equals actual WTP; the appropriate default, if any, for a calibration
factor; whether a calibration requirement should be included in a technical information document rather than in
the rule; and whether inclusion of a calibration requirement is consistent with the

 decision upholding the inclusion of all reliably calculated values in a damage assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department solicits comments regarding whether marketing research which attempts to establish relationships
between stated intentions to purchase and actual purchase behavior for private goods is relevant to the calibration
of CV results for natural resource damage assessments. If commenters believe that research to be relevant, additional
comments are solicited regarding the appropriate actual behavior with which similar relationships could be established
the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies. Commenters should explicitly state the behavioral links between
the suggested actual behavior and the hypothetical behavior elicited by CV studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wishes to emphasize to those who support the use of a default calibration factor that they should supply
specific information to support whatever factor they believe the Department should adopt. The adoption of a definite
calibration factor would have to be supported by information in the administrative record.

NOAA has proposed a standard for reporting the results of CV surveys. The Department solicits comment on whether the

F. Additional Requests for Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Prior Knowledge
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of conducting a CV study in a natural resource damage assessment is to determine the damages suffered
by the public as a result of a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance into the environment. For consideration
of lost nonuse values, the relevant public may include the entire U.S. population, or may include a regional subset
of the population. Damages may be sustained by each individual in the relevant public, but only a small fraction of
the public will actually participate in the survey. The damages an individual suffers from a discharge or release
depend on many factors. These include the effects of the discharge or release on natural resources, how much the individual
uses the services provided by the injured resources, individual preferences, and the individual's information
about the release or discharge and the world in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting the survey, it is necessary to educate the respondent about the natural resource itself, the facts surrounding
a discharge or release, and the impacts of the discharge or release on the resource. This education process greatly
changes the respondent's information set. Upon gaining this new information, respondents are then asked to place
a value on the losses suffered. There is general agreement that the losses an individual experiences from a discharge
or release after learning the new information are likely to be systematically different than the losses they would
experience prior to learning the new information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters have argued that the fact that the CV method itself actively changes the information set of an individual
prior to valuing the good or service makes it fundamentally different from other economic valuation methodologies.
These commenters have questioned whether it is appropriate to extrapolate value estimates based on post-survey
information to the general population. Given the assessment's objective of estimating damages owed to the public
at large, and the small fraction of the public that actually participates in the survey, some have argued that the relevant
information set for the purposes of extrapolating to the general population is the pre-survey information set. One
way to move towards value estimates that reflect the information set of the general public is to obtain information
in the survey itself regarding the respondents' pre-existing knowledge about the resource and injury to it. Regardless
of the value a respondent states after learning information from the survey, those respondents who were not aware
of the resource or an injury to it or both would be assigned a value of zero. The rationale for assigning a zero value is
that if X percent of the survey respondents did not know about the resource or injury, then X percent of the relevant
public is likely to be similarly uninformed. (Implicit is the assumption that individuals who are unaware of the injury
at the time of the survey would continue unaware, but for the survey, for the foreseeable future.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters have articulated the point of view that the level of respondents' prior information about the injury
is irrelevant to the determination of natural resource damages. According to these commenters, an education process
increases the reliability of CV by exposing respondents to a uniform set of information regarding the characteristics
of the commodity, availability of substitutes, and prices. Consumers undertake a similar education process in private
markets to form their demands for other commodities. In this sense, the education process is necessary so that CV is
not fundamentally different from other valuation methodologies. Further, these commenters have stated that the
fact that an individual is not informed of a specific injury does not mean that he or she suffers no loss as a result of
the injury. Natural resources are held in trust for the public. Therefore, WTA rather than WTP would be the most appropriate
measure of lost values of injured resources, were it not for the technical difficulties involved in eliciting WTA.
Each member of the public has an interest in the injured natural resources being valued regardless of whether he or
she is aware of the particular resources and injuries. Therefore, these commenters believe it would be inappropriate
to require that CV respondents' values only be counted if they were aware of the injured resources before the survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comments on whether it is appropriate to use information regarding pre-existing knowledge
of respondents to reassign to zero any positive values expressed by individuals who were unaware of the injuries prior
to the survey in the calculation of damages. Commenters who believe it is appropriate to assign zero damages to individuals
with limited prior knowledge should articulate the rationale for doing so. Commenters who believe that it is inappropriate
to assign zero damages to individuals with limited prior knowledge should articulate their rationale for using the
post-survey information set to extrapolate damages to a public that only has pre-survey information.

2. Screening or Threshold Factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of concern by many commenters that CV surveys may be undertaken in damage cases where expected damages may
be too small to justify the costs of the CV survey, the Department is seeking comment on the concept of a screening factor
that trustee officials should apply in deciding whether to conduct a CV survey of nonuse values in a particular case.
Factors currently limiting the use of CV include the high costs of surveys to meet NOAA's proposed standards, trustee
budget and staff limitations, and trustee desire for speedy judgment to enable expeditious restoration activities.
To employ an additional screening factor, expected damages might be estimated using a small sample with protocols
designed to minimize survey costs and, therefore, not necessarily subject to the standards contained in NOAA's proposed
rule. Alternatively, expected damages might be estimated by scaling damages estimated in other CV studies. Other
methods may be possible. Several possible thresholds have been suggested. These possibilities include setting
the threshold for a particular case at the greater of twice the expected cost of a full CV survey or the product of multiplying
$5 per household by the number of households expected to hold nonuse values for the resource of concern. The Department
is specifically seeking comment on: Whether such a screening factor would be appropriate; what form a factor might
take; whether the factor should apply to total damages or only to lost nonuse values; and whether inclusion of a screening
factor is consistent with the

IV. Technical Information Document
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a guidance document on use of CV.
This document will provide additional technical information on possible means of satisfying any standards contained
in the damage assessment regulations as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies. Once a draft of the
document has been prepared, the Department will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing its availability and soliciting comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department requests comments on additional tests for determining the reliability of CV estimates for possible
inclusion in the technical information document. In order to evaluate any additional tests, the Department requests
that commenters provide a complete list of the behavioral assumptions underlying their theoretical framework of
rational choice. The Department assumes that commenters will begin with what economists consider to be the generally
accepted axioms of neoclassical consumer choice theory or revealed preference theory. The Department requests
that commenters clearly state all further assumptions underlying the test and describe the sensitivity of the test's
results to the assumptions presented. Second, if commenters are proposing tests that rely on marginal or infra-marginal
changes in the scope of the injuries, the commenters should describe how the variation of scope dimensions involved
in the test would be quantified. Third, and perhaps most important, the Department asks that commenters explain how
any proposed test can be accomplished feasibly within the survey instrument design and development and survey administration
standards specified in NOAA's proposed rule. Tests causing CV surveys to violate these standards are themselves
unreliable tests. Fourth, the commenter should give examples of how these tests would be structured in the context
of a hazardous substance release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, commenters have expressed concern about the valuation of past nonuse losses. The Department believes that
when little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents'
WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since
the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, the Department is soliciting
comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time for possible inclusion in the
technical information document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments on the assessment of lost nonuse values were widely divergent but generally fell into two primary schools
of thought. One set of commenters thought that trustee officials should have the discretion to decide on a case-by-case
basis when lost nonuse values should be included in a damage assessment. These commenters stated that assessment
of lost nonuse values is necessary to ensure that the public is made whole for natural resource injuries. One commenter
noted that inclusion of lost nonuse values in damage assessments is particularly crucial in the case of injuries to
tribal resources because of the special spiritual and cultural significance that natural resources hold for Indian
tribes. Some commenters stated that if the Department does not include provisions for assessing lost nonuse values
in the regulations, then the Department would send inappropriate economic signals to PRPs and could cause risky activities
to be directed toward pristine environments where use values are very low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, this set of commenters thought that CV is a reliable methodology for calculating lost nonuse values. Some
of these commenters stated that studies purporting to demonstrate that CV produces unreliable results have failed
to distinguish between well and poorly designed CV surveys. A few of these commenters took issue with the Department's
discussion in the July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of the potential for bias in CV studies. Some commenters stated that the Department had failed to recognize
that the real bias lies in using methodologies that consistently undervalue public losses by computing compensable
value based solely on lost use values. Other commenters questioned the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that although all valuation methodologies have potential reliability problems, CV, when used to estimate
lost nonuse values, poses more significant problems because the per-person bias is multiplied by a larger population.
These commenters thought that the Department's line of reasoning, if taken to its logical extreme, would dictate
the nonsensical result that only small values should be measured. A number of commenters made reference to the report
issued by the NOAA panel. According to these commenters, the NOAA panel report concluded that CV can produce reliable
estimates of lost nonuse values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other set of commenters thought that the rule should not include any provisions for the assessment of lost nonuse
values. These commenters stated that assessment of lost nonuse values is not necessary to compensate the public because
trustee officials already have the discretion to assess lost use values in addition to the cost of restoring, rehabilitating,
replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. These commenters stated that assessment of
lost nonuse values was inconsistent with general legal principles designed to prevent speculative damages. For
example, the commenters noted that courts only allow certain categories of individuals to recover damages for pain
and suffering in tort cases. Other commenters stated that allowing assessment of lost nonuse values would be punitive
because it amounts to charging PRPs for hurting the public's feelings. Some commenters expressed concern that allowing
assessment of nonuse values could drive companies out of business and cause an increase in consumer prices. A few commenters
expressed skepticism that nonuse values were actually economic values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This set of commenters also thought that CV cannot reliably calculate nonuse values. These commenters stated that
the results of CV studies are inconsistent with rational decisionmaking. For example, a number of commenters cited
CV surveys in which stated WTP did not respond to increases in the commodity being valued. Some commenters stated that
the results of CV surveys are overly sensitive to the wording and administration of the survey instrument. Several
commenters thought that CV results seem unrealistically high compared to actual contributions to environmental
causes. Some commenters stated that such disparities result because CV respondents do not adequately consider their
budget constraints when determining their WTP. A number of commenters thought that responses to CV surveys were likely
to reflect feelings of vengeance toward PRPs or the warm glow of supporting a worthy cause rather than the respondents'
actual WTP to prevent injury to the specific resources in question. Other commenters noted that CV studies require
respondents to perform difficult valuation tasks with which they have little prior experience. A few commenters
expressed particular concern about the public's ability to provide accurate values for injuries in industrial areas
where contamination may exist that is unrelated to the release in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters provided citations to studies purporting to demonstrate the unreliability of CV. A number of commenters
stated that even some CV practitioners have called CV experimental. Other commenters noted that the NOAA panel did
not conclude that CV could produce estimates of lost nonuse values that were reliable enough to be granted a rebuttable
presumption. Rather, according to these commenters, the NOAA panel stated that even if a CV study met a number of strict
standards, it would only be reliable enough to serve as a starting point in litigation. Therefore, these commenters
thought that even if the Department allowed CV to be used to estimate lost nonuse values, it should not grant the results
of CV studies of lost nonuse values a rebuttable presumption. Finally, most of the commenters who thought that CV was
unreliable when used to estimate lost nonuse values also thought that this unreliability was the result of fundamental
flaws that economists do not know how to correct at this time.

held that the Department's type B rule should allow for the recovery of all reliably calculated lost values of injured
resources, including lost nonuse values. 880 F.2d at 464. Therefore, the focus of this notice is not whether lost nonuse
values per se are an appropriate component of a natural resource damage assessment. This notice addresses whether
lost nonuse values can be reliably calculated and, if so, under what conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department acknowledges that a poorly designed or administered CV study, like any poorly designed or administered
valuation study, can produce unreliable results. However, based on the evidence received to date, the Department
does not believe that CV is a fundamentally flawed methodology. The Department believes that a properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and administered CV study can produce reliable estimates of lost nonuse values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also believes that the results of a CV study of lost nonuse values performed in accordance with whatever
standards are ultimately included in the type B rule should receive a rebuttable presumption. CERCLA provides that
the natural resource damage assessment regulations are to identify the best available procedures and that assessments
performed in accordance with the regulations receive a rebuttable presumption.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were numerous comments on possible guidance for the conduct of CV studies. A few commenters thought that guidance
was unnecessary. Most commenters, though, thought that some guidance was advisable. A number of commenters, noting
that NOAA is developing standards based on the NOAA panel report, suggested that the Department postpone development
of guidance until NOAA evaluates the report and issues a proposed rule. Some commenters thought that the Department
should incorporate NOAA's rulemaking record before deciding on guidance. Other commenters urged the Department
to make any proposed guidance available for public review and comment before issuing a final rule.

The Department believes that standards for the use of CV should be included in the type B rule to improve reliability.
The Department does not think it is advisable to incorporate NOAA's rulemaking record because that record covers
a wide range of issues beyond CV. However, the Department did consider the NOAA panel report. Also, numerous commenters
on the Department's July 22, 1993,

 notice submitted copies of comments they had provided to NOAA on its rulemaking. The Department agrees that commenters
should have an adequate opportunity to review and comment on the standards being considered for the use of CV; therefore,
the Department has issued this notice. The Department invites commenters on NOAA's proposed rule to submit comments
to the Department on this proposed rule as well.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters responded to the Department's request for suggestions on the content of possible guidance
on the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. Several commenters suggested that the Department adopt some or all
of the standards contained in the NOAA panel report. Some commenters thought that the Department should include both
the standards in the NOAA panel report and additional standards. Other commenters offered their own standards. The
suggested standards covered six major areas: restrictions on the type of resource for which lost nonuse values could
be assessed; restrictions on the relevant population; protection against the influence of improper motives; standards
for ensuring that respondents consider all relevant factors when estimating their WTP; standards for determining
whether CV results are consistent with basic tenets of rationality; and methods of calibrating CV results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters thought that assessment of lost nonuse values should be limited to cases where there have been long-lasting
injuries to resources with few substitutes. These commenters stated that such a limitation was necessary to prevent
speculative claims. These commenters also agreed with the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that in cases where injuries are of short duration and where the injured resources have many substitutes, nonuse
losses are likely to be minimal. Other commenters objected to such a limitation noting that there is no empirical evidence
that there cannot be a loss of nonuse values in cases where injuries are of short duration or where there are many substitutes
for the injured resources. These commenters also noted that such a restriction is unrelated to reliability. Some
commenters stated that such a limitation might prevent assessment of lost nonuse values where individual animals
had been killed but overall population levels were unaffected. These commenters stated that the public may well experience
nonuse losses for the death of the individual animals since each individual animal is, in some sense, irreplaceable.

A number of commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to limit the relevant population to those persons
with prior knowledge of the release or discharge and the affected resources. These commenters thought that if individuals
did not have prior knowledge of the injury, then they could not have experienced a loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the Department develop standards to protect against the influence of improper
motives. These commenters expressed concern that respondents might provide answers based on the warm glow of supporting
a worthy cause rather than their WTP for injury prevention or resource restoration. These commenters also thought
that the Department should ensure that respondents are not motivated by vengeance against PRPs. In particular, some
commenters suggested that trustee officials be required to demonstrate that the results of a CV study do not change
if respondents are asked their WTP to prevent a naturally occurring injury rather than an injury resulting from human
activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters thought that, given the novelty of the task they are asked to perform, CV respondents are unlikely
to consider all relevant factors on their own. Therefore, these commenters suggested that respondents be reminded
of their budget constraints and the availability of substitutes for the resources being valued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous commenters thought there should be standards for determining whether CV studies produce results consistent
with the basic tenets of rationality. For example, several commenters thought that WTP should increase as the amount
of the commodity being valued increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that the Department should develop guidance on how to calibrate hypothetical WTP with
actual WTP. Some commenters suggested that trustee officials attempt to collect actual funds from CV respondents
and use the results to calibrate stated WTP. Other commenters thought that the Department should develop a formula
for calibrating WTP based on a ratio between lost use values and lost nonuse values.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has carefully reviewed the standards offered by the commenters and the standards included in the NOAA
panel report. The Department does not believe that assessment of lost nonuse values should be restricted only to cases
involving long-lasting injuries to resources with few substitutes. The Department believes that such a restriction
would not address the reliability of CV and, therefore, would be inconsistent with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to restricting the relevant population to persons with prior knowledge of the discharge or release and
the affected resources, the Department has decided to solicit additional comment, as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to improper motive, the Department finds no evidence to suggest that warm glow and vengeance are necessarily
prevalent in CV studies. The Department believes that when CV respondents are asked their WTP in a credible context
they are adequately focused on the commodity of injury prevention or resource restoration rather than some other
commodity such as the warm glow of giving or vengeance toward PRPs. NOAA's proposed rule includes a requirement that
trustee officials use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive compatible. Further, the Department believes
that vengeance is not a prevalent motivation in a CV study in which respondents are asked how much they would be willing
to pay rather than how much a PRP should be required to pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that CV respondents may not always consider every relevant factor on their own. NOAA's proposed
rule would require that the survey instrument place the commodity to be valued in the context of related natural resources.
NOAA's proposed rule would also require respondents to be reminded of their budget constraints prior to being asked
their WTP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also agrees that questions of unreliability arise when studies produce results that are inconsistent
with basic tenets of rationality. NOAA's proposed rule includes a standard to ensure that CV survey responses satisfy
one important tenet of rationality, namely that WTP increases as the severity of the injuries or the level of effectiveness
and timing of the restoration or prevention program increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to calibrating hypothetical WTP to actual WTP, NOAA's proposed rule includes a calibration requirement.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters responded to the Department's request for comment on the proper placement of any guidance developed
for the use of CV. Some commenters thought that any guidance developed by the Department should be placed in the preamble
or in a guidance document. These commenters noted that CV is an evolving methodology and expressed concern that placing
guidance in the rule could lock in standards that might soon be found to be ill-advised. Other commenters thought that
detailed standards should be placed in the rule itself to minimize the risk of unreliable studies being given a rebuttable
presumption. Some commenters thought that the establishment of clear standards in the rule was particularly important
since there are no generally accepted standards among CV practitioners. These commenters noted that any standards
placed in the rule could be updated during biennial reviews.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that poorly designed and administered CV studies can pose reliability problems. Therefore,
the Department believes that standards for the use of CV should be included in the rule itself to improve the reliability
of CV studies that receive a rebuttable presumption. However, the Department recognizes that CV is an evolving methodology.
Therefore, the Department believes that only those standards that are unlikely to change over time should be included
in the rule and that trustee officials should be given some flexibility in determining how to meet these standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as discussed above, the Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a technical
information document on the use of CV. This document will provide additional technical information on possible means
of satisfying any standards contained in the rule as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies.

 A few commenters responded to the Department's request for comments on how to ensure that CV studies are cost-effective
and can be performed at a reasonable cost. Some commenters thought that the real issue was how to reduce the cost of performing
a CV study, rather than how to ensure cost-effectiveness and reasonable cost. These commenters suggested that the
Department fund reference CV studies.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that PRPs should have access to all assessment data collected by trustee officials, including
any data collected in a CV study. Section 11.90 of the Department's existing type B rule provides that at the conclusion
of an assessment, trustee officials must prepare a Report of Assessment that is presented to the PRP. The Report of
Assessment includes all test results. NOAA's proposed rule provides that the report of a CV study must include a discussion
of the relevant factors identified in the standards pertaining to survey instrument design and development, survey
administration, and nature of results, as well as a copy of the survey instrument. If the same standards were added
to the Department's type B rule, the report of the CV study would be included in the Report of Assessment. Also, under
&sect;11.91(c) of the Department's existing type B rule, everything in the administrative record of the assessment,
including all data collected in a CV survey, would be available for review during the judicial discovery process.

 A few commenters noted that WTA, not WTP, is the correct theoretical measure of lost resource values. These commenters
acknowledged that there are practical problems with using CV studies to calculate WTA. However, the commenters stated
that the Department should allow trustee officials to use methods that translate WTP into WTA and provided copies
of articles describing such methods.

The Department maintains that willingness to pay and willingness to accept are both theoretically valid criteria
for estimating damages to nonmarketed natural resources. In addition, the Department continues to maintain that
willingness to accept may be the criterion most germane to natural resource damages, since the public has the property
right to the injured natural resource. However, the Department also agrees with many of the comments that recognize
that the application of the willingness-to-accept criterion can lead to more technical difficulties and uncertainties
than the willingness-to-pay criterion. 51 FR 27721.

 A few commenters thought that if the Department allows assessment of lost nonuse values, it should not allow assessment
of so-called intrinsic values that purport to represent the value of the resource in and of itself rather than the value
of the resource to humans.

 Some commenters stated that if the Department allows assessment of lost nonuse values, it should also require trustee
officials to assess the benefits to society of the activity giving rise to the release or discharge and claim only the
net loss.

 When Congress passed CERCLA and CWA it decided that parties responsible for hazardous substance releases or oil discharges
should compensate the public for the resulting natural resource damages, notwithstanding the possible societal
benefits of the activities giving rise to the release. CERCLA and CWA were designed to ensure full compensation for
natural resource damages resulting from hazardous substance releases or oil discharges. Nothing in the statutes
suggests that trustee officials are required to assess the benefits to society of the activity giving rise to the release
or discharge and claim only the net loss. Further, many of these benefits are already accounted for in current market
activity whereas the costs of the associated release or discharge are not.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters disagreed with the Department's statement that CV is the only method available for estimating lost
nonuse values. These commenters thought that trustee officials should be allowed to estimate lost nonuse values
through analysis of charitable donations, insurance premiums, and conservation expenditures.

 Section 11.83(c)(3) of the March 25, 1994, final rule allows trustee officials to use any valuation methodology,
regardless of whether it is explicitly listed, provided it measures the public's WTP and satisfies the criteria set
forth in &sect;11.83(a)(2). 59 FR 14286. The Department is currently unaware of any methodology available for the
express purpose of estimating economically valued nonuse losses of specific injured resources, other than CV, that
meets these specifications.

 Some commenters thought that if assessment of lost nonuse values is allowed, the Department should restrict such
assessment to present and future values.

 Where little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents'
WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since
the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, as discussed above,
the Department is soliciting comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time
for possible inclusion in a technical information document.

admissibility of evidence. Some commenters cited case law for the proposition that CV studies of lost nonuse values
do not meet judicial standards for admissibility of evidence.

The Department certifies that this rule will not have significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The rule provides technical procedural guidance
for the assessment of damages to natural resources. It does not directly impose any additional cost. As the rule applies
to natural resource trustees, it is not expected to have an effect on a substantial number of small entities.
