SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its Real Estate Title Clearance and Loan Closing regulation.
This action is necessary to make the FmHA loan closing procedure consistent with the private sector for commercial
loans and to make loan closing requirements consistent with local laws and procedures that are typical in the area.
The effect will be to provide the public with easy access to FmHA programs.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FmHA recognizes the need to make Real Estate Title Clearance and Loan Closing procedures more consistent with the
laws and generally accepted loan closing practices of individual States. Some proposed changes in this rule will
allow FmHA State Directors the authority to establish loan closing procedures that are applicable to the laws and
customs of that particular State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The significant proposed changes are listed below in general order of appearance in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several new definitions are added to help clarify certain issues. They include Closing Protection Letter, General
Warranty Deed, Indemnification Agreement, Issuing Agent and Special Warranty Deed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to differences in State laws regarding the use of title insurance and in the standard insurance coverage for errors
and omission insurance and fidelity bond coverage, this proposed rule will allow FmHA State Directors to decide (with
OGC approval) on the loan closing procedures and level of insurance coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that Title Insurance Companies will provide an Indemnification Agreement (Closing Protection
Letter) is added because it will greatly increase the insurance protection provided to the United States Government.
This is a practice that Title Insurance Companies are familiar with and they understand our needs. An Indemnification
Agreement can be provided for approved attorneys so the need for errors and omissions insurance and a fidelity bond
can be eliminated. The agreement will provide loss coverage for the entire amount of the transaction with no deductible.
The Indemnification Agreement will give FmHA protection from losses resulting from negligence or fraud caused by
the closing agent or their employees. Indemnification Agreements give FmHA greater protection against malpractice
and fiduciary risks than the insurance policies required by our current regulations. There is no additional cost
incurred by requiring an Indemnification Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This instruction suggests the use of Title Insurance for all loan closings. Approved attorneys can provide title
insurance coverage as an agent for a Title Insurance Company and therefore not be excluded from being a closing agent.
The advantages of Title Insurance are the Indemnification Agreement can be issued by the Title Insurance Company,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed to FmHA, to protect FmHA against losses caused by the negligence of closing agents or employees. It will
eliminate the need for errors and omissions insurance and a fidelity bond. The Indemnification Agreement will protect
FmHA for 100 percent of the loan transaction, not a limited insured amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An attorney's opinion would provide limited coverage because the statute of limitations on an attorney's liability
runs from 2 years to 8 years, depending on the State, from the date of the opinion. If the attorney's practice is interrupted,
the means for correcting problems or collecting damages may become an issue.

Form of Title Certification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Director will, with OGC approval, issue a state instruction specifying whether title insurance will be
required at loan closing for some or all loans in the state or if, in some or all cases, a title opinion from an approved
attorney will be sufficient. Title insurance is the recommended method for protecting FmHA interests. State Directors
are authorized to require title insurance for all loan closings or some loan closings based on the type of loan and/or
the geographical area of the state. If title insurance is used, State Directors are authorized to require a closing
protection letter issued by an approved title insurance company to cover the closing agent, if such closing protection
letters are customarily provided by title insurance companies in the state. The State Director's determination
to require the use of title insurance will be based on the commercial and residential loan closing practices of the
state and the economic and legal feasibility of obtaining title insurance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney or title company may act as a closing agent and close FmHA real estate loans, provide necessary title clearance,
and perform such other duties as are set forth in this subpart. A closing agent will be responsible for closing FmHA
loans and disbursing both FmHA loan funds and funds provided by the borrower in connection with the FmHA loan. The borrower
will select his or her closing agent. FmHA employees will not recommend the use of any particular closing agent or title
insurance company, although as provided in &sect;927.54(a) the borrower may be required by a state instruction to
provide title clearance with either a title insurance policy or an attorney's opinion. If title clearance is by an
attorney's opinion, the approval official will approve the attorney who will perform the closing on a case-by-case
basis in accordance with &sect;927.54(c) prior to loan closing. In such cases the attorney will be approved after
submitting Form FmHA 1927&hyph;19, ``Certification of Attorney.'' If title certification will be by means of a policy
of title insurance, the title company which will issue the policy must have been approved in accordance with &sect;927.54(d).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approval of attorneys.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any attorney selected by an FmHA applicant, who will be providing title clearance where the certification of title
is based on an attorney's opinion, must submit a completed Form FmHA 1927&hyph;19 certifying to professional liability
insurance coverage and fidelity coverage of the attorney and the attorney's employees. The approval official will
approve on a case-by-case basis any attorney who is duly licensed to practice law in the state where the real estate
security is located and who complies with the bonding and insurance requirements in this section. If the certification
of title will be by means of title insurance, any attorney or closing agent designated as an approved attorney or closing
agent by the approved title insurance company which will issue the policy of title insurance will be acceptable, and
when covered by a closing protection letter, will not be required to obtain professional liability insurance or a
fidelity bond, if the closing protection letter is the ALTA form Closing Protection Letter or provides at least equivalent
protection to FmHA as the professional liability and fidelity insurance required in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of
this section. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved attorneys and closing
agents, addressed to the FmHA State Director, that are covered by its closing protection letters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An attorney issuing an attorney's title opinion must have in full force and effect an acceptable professional
liability insurance policy for errors and omissions. The State Director will determine the appropriate level of
such insurance and what level of deductible is permissible according to what is customary in the area and necessary
for the protection of FmHA. The State Director will issue a State Instruction specifying this coverage. Required
insurance will, as a minimum, cover the amount of the loan to be closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An attorney that is issuing an attorney's title opinion or, if title insurance is being obtained, an attorney or
closing agent that is not covered by a closing protection letter must have in full force and effect a fidelity type bond.
If partners, associates, or members of the staff of the attorney or closing agent have access to the funds in the escrow
account, each such individual must either have a separate fidelity type bond to cover any fraudulent or dishonest
act or such person(s) may be covered by a blanket fidelity bond. While it is recommended that $50,000 of protection
be maintained for each individual person, the State Director will determine the appropriate level of insurance according
to what is customary in the area and necessary for the protection of FmHA. The State Director will approve the form of
the bond although Form FmHA 1927&hyph;18, ``Fidelity Bond for Loan Closing Attorneys,'' is an optional form that
is acceptable to FmHA and may be used.

State Director, and will contain only standard types of exceptions and exclusions approved in advance by the approval
official with the advice of OGC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Title insurance company is licensed to do business in the state (if a license is required) and is not Federally debarred
or suspended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Title insurance company submits copies of audited financial statements, Form 9 financial statements, or other
approved financial statements satisfactory to the State Director, which indicate that the company has financial
ability to cover losses arising out of its activities as a title insurance company and under any closing protection
letters issued by the title insurance company. The financial statements must also demonstrate that the title insurance
company has sufficient resources to reimburse FmHA for any losses caused by fraud or dishonesty by the company and
its authorized agents, or failure of the company or its authorized agents to follow or comply with FmHA's written closing
instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Title insurance company agrees that the title insurance company employee or closing agent who supervises the
closing of the transaction will be authorized to receive funds and give receipts for the company's charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Above listed approval process will be repeated at least every 5 years, or more often if adverse information becomes
available, to insure continued compliance by the title insurance company.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The attorney or closing agent will be notified within 5 business days of the specific reasons for rejection. No

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether there are outstanding Federal or State tax claims (including taxes which under state law may become a lien
superior to a previously attaching mortgage lien),

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether outstanding judgments of record, bankruptcy, insolvency, or probate proceedings involving any part
of the property, whether already owned by the borrower, or to be acquired by assumption or with loan funds, or involving
the borrower or the seller exist, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If a water right is to be included in the security for the loan. The closing agent must attach a full legal description

Use of title insurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When title insurance is to be obtained, the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing
any defects in, and encumbrances against, the title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable, and the curative
or other actions to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a commitment to issue a mortgagee
and owner's title policy in an amount at least equal the amount of the loan. In the case of an assumption without a subsequent
loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company
agrees in writing to extend coverage in full force and effect.

Approval official's responsibilities after receipt of preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon receipt of the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder, the approval official will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Check the opinion or binder carefully. If any required information is omitted, or if the standard form of opinion
or binder is amended, the approval official will return it for completion or correction. If the closing agent is unable
or unwilling to comply, the approval official will send the opinion or binder with a full explanation to OGC through
the State Director for advice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Check the legal description of the land, water rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other security involved,
to determine that the description covers all of the property rights intended to be taken as security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Review all exceptions to title shown in the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder. The approval
official will determine which exceptions must be modified, eliminated or waived, or whether an agreement with prior
lienholders is necessary or advisable to protect FmHA's interests. If prior encumbrance(s) will remain, the approval
official should obtain and review a copy of each to insure that its terms are acceptable to FmHA. If an option or sales
contract which lists acceptable exceptions is involved, the approval official will determine whether the exceptions
in the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder are the same as those in the option or sales contract and
inform the applicant of discrepancies. If the approval official has any doubt as to the acceptability or effect of
any exception, the applicant will be requested to obtain a clarification. The approval official will consult with
the closing agent and/or the State Director when necessary to determine the acceptability of any exception. If the
approval official determines that any defects cannot be corrected, or the effect of certain exceptions on the title,
suitability, security value, or successful operation of the property is not clear, and they cannot be corrected or
eliminated without undue expense, the approval official will forward the preliminary title opinion or title insurance
binder to the State Director together with comments regarding the objectionable features and copies of the exceptions
when needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If, with the advice of OGC, the State Director determines that the exceptions will not adversely affect the title
to the property or its suitability, security value, or successful operation, the State Director will advise the approval
official. The approval official will then arrange for closing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the State Director, with the advice of OGC, finds that these exceptions will adversely affect the title to the
property, its suitability, security value, or successful operation, the State Director may waive them conditionally
and instruct the approval official as to how the conditions may be met, or instruct the approval official that the loan
cannot be closed because of the defect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approval official may arrange a closing when he/she determines that exceptions shown in the preliminary title
opinion or title insurance binder (if any) will not adversely affect the suitability, security value, or successful
operation of the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The approval official will make sure that all requirements of subpart I of part 1940 of this chapter have been met
before the loan is closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In arranging for loan closing, the approval official will send Form FmHA 1927&hyph;15, ``Loan Closing Instructions/Loan
Closing Statement For,'' to the the closing agent. When a title insurance commitment is involved, the ``loan closing
instructions'' will include any corrections required by the commitment. Therefore, the title insurance commitment
must be received before the final closing instructions are transmitted. At the same time, send written notification
of loan closing to the applicant. For single family housing loans Form FmHA 1927&hyph;16, ``Notification of Loan
Closing,'' will be used to notify the applicant.

If the borrowers are married, FmHA prefers, but will not require, that title to the real estate will be held in such a
way that, upon the death of a borrower, it will pass to the surviving spouse by law to prevent the real estate from being
tied up in probate proceedings. Title may be held in any manner that permits obtaining the required mortgage.

Deeds will be prepared as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Conveyances of title to borrowers by parties other than FmHA will be by general warranty deed. If a general warranty
deed cannot be obtained, a special warranty deed, quitclaim deed, or grant deed may be used if the entity providing
title clearance (closing agent) determines that the deed used will vest in the borrower a good and marketable title
of record. All conveyances by FmHA will be by quitclaim deed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The deed to the security property will show the exceptions to which the title is subject and should, where customary,
contain a tie-in description showing that it covers the same land or part of the same land as that designated or described
in another deed or mortgage described specifically by date, parties, and recording data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The closing agent will insure that all mortgages are properly prepared, completed, executed, and filed for record.
Where applicable, the mortgages should recite that it is

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Real estate mortgage forms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FmHA mortgage forms will be used in all cases and other FmHA forms will be used whenever possible. Form FmHA 1927&hyph;1,
``Real Estate Mortgage or Deed of Trust For 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' (state) will be used for all insured and direct loans except where Form FmHA 1927&hyph;7 (State), is used for all
rural housing loans. These forms will be prepared and distributed in accordance with state supplements. When a loan
is made to a homestead entryman or to a contract purchaser of a farm unit from the Bureau of Reclamation, a rider to Form
FmHA 1927&hyph;1 will be used per state supplement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) The original recorded mortgage is to be retained in the borrower's case file unless the original mortgage is retained
by the recorder, and a conformed copy will be provided to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the original is to be retained by the recorder, an original and two conformed copies will be prepared. One
conformed copy will be retained in the borrower's case file and one conformed copy will be provided to the borrower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Extra copies of mortgages may be needed in individual cases in some participation loans, loans on reclamation
projects, when security is taken on trust or restricted property involving loans to Native American, and other similar
situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The closing agent will distribute copies to appropriate parties at loan closing or as soon as possible thereafter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Persons required to execute mortgage.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The mortgage will be executed by the borrower and all other persons having an interest in the real property being mortgaged
whose execution is necessary for FmHA to have the required lien priority, (for example, a spouse's right of dower or
curtesy) so that, in the event of default, the mortgage will be enforceable against all such interests. Persons signing
the promissory note and the mortgage will use exactly the same names which appear on the title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the applicant is a corporation or cooperative, the mortgage will be executed by the authorized officers on
behalf of the corporation or cooperative. Authorization must be granted to the officers by either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A duly adopted resolution of the board of directors authorizing such execution and indicating which officers
are authorized to execute the loan documents on behalf of the corporation/cooperative, unless applicable FmHA instruction
or state law prohibits. The resolution must bear the certification of the corporate/cooperative secretary that
it was duly adopted and not revoked and have the corporate seal affixed, if applicable, to be acceptable. When shareholder
approval is necessary the resolution must recite that shareholder approval has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the applicant is a partnership, the mortgage must be executed by the partners required by the partnership
agreement to execute loan documents on its behalf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When the applicant is a trust, the requirements of the trust agreement and state law shall control as to who is
authorized to execute the loan documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Date of Execution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The mortgage will be dated and executed on the same date as the promissory note. If necessary, the mortgage may be done
on a different date provided it is not executed before the date of the note or after the date of closing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title exceptions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The mortgage will specifically describe all exceptions it will be subject to, if customary under local practice
or required by state law or state supplement. The exceptions will normally be shown as part of or immediately following
the legal description of the land and must be the same as shown on the final title opinion or mortgagee policy of title
insurance. In cases where specific description of each exception to title is not customary or required, these exceptions
may be described by use of a general statement similar to the following (unless inconsistent with applicable State
law): ``Subject, however, to all outstanding covenants, conditions, restrictions, reservations, liens, encumbrances,
easements, rights of way, leases, mineral, oil, gas and geothermal rights (with or without the right of surface entry),
timber rights, water rights, judgements, pending court proceedings, probate proceedings and agreements which
limit the title to the property.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Releasing or retaining existing mortgages in refinancing cases
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. When there is an outstanding FmHA real estate mortgage against the property and the loan secured by the mortgage is
being refinanced with the current loan, the mortgage for the outstanding loan will be superseded and will be released
at the time of loan closing, unless it is necessary under state law to keep the existing mortgage in effect to retain
a valid lien of the same priority for the obligation being refinanced.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Describing notes in mortgages
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In most cases, only the note(s) for the new loan(s) needs to be described when a subsequent loan is made and a subsequent
mortgage is taken. The note(s) for any unpaid loan(s) secured by real estate will not be described in the mortgage unless
the approval official determines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It is necessary to do so to protect the government's interest, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The description of the unpaid prior secured note(s) in the mortgage being taken would not result in a higher title
insurance premium for the new mortgage, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) State law requires that all original notes be presented when filing a security instrument. A State supplement
should reflect this exception when applicable.

the loan is payable to the date of the promissory note: for example, if the note is dated March 30, 1987, and the final
payment is due and payable 20 years from that date, the ``Due Date of Final Installment'' is March 30, 2007.

Alteration of mortgage form.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A mortgage form may be altered pursuant to a state supplement having prior approval of the National Office, or in a special
case, to comply with the terms of loan approval prescribed in accordance with program instructions. No other alterations
in the printed mortgage forms will be made without prior approval of the National Office. Any changes made by deletion,
substitution, or addition (excluding filling in blanks) will be initialed in the margin by all persons signing the
mortgage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the space provided on the mortgage for the description of the real property security, the leasehold estate and
the land covered by the lease must be described. The following language must be used: ``All of borrower's right, title

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The legal description on the mortgage should be taken directly from the title insurance commitment or the title abstract
to insure accuracy of the legal description. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preparation of the promissory note
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The closing agent will make sure that the promissory note (or assumption agreement) is completed in accordance with
the forms manual insert (FMI), and executed. The approval official will determine who is to execute the promissory
note, including cosigners, if necessary, in accordance with program instructions and provide the closing agent
with the names of these individuals. If the applicant is a corporation, partnership, or trust, the approval official
will provide the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) executing the promissory note on behalf of the entity.
Any other signatures on the note (or assumption agreement) needed to insure the required security, as provided in
state supplements, will be obtained. Persons having a disability of minority or mental incompetency, or persons
who have not been legally admitted for residency in the U.S., its territories, or possessions, are not to execute the
promissory note. The date shown on the note will be the date it is executed by the borrower which may not be later than
the date of the mortgage.

. If any liens (other than FmHA liens or tax liens to local governmental authorities) or security agreements (hereafter
called ``liens''), with priority over FmHA's mortgage will remain against the real property securing the loan(s),
the lienholders must execute, in recordable form, agreements containing all of the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The prior lienholder shall agree not to declare the lien in default or accelerate the indebtedness secured by the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Provide that the specified period of time will not commence until the lienholder gives written notice of the borrower's
default and the prior lienholder's intention to accelerate the indebtedness to the FmHA office servicing the loan,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Include the address of the FmHA servicing office,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) Provide that the prior lienholder will not declare the lien in default for any nonmonetary reason if FmHA commences
liquidation proceedings against the property and thereafter acquires the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the prior lien secures future advances, including the lienholder's costs for borrower liquidation or bankruptcy,
which under state law have priority over the mortgage being taken (or a FmHA mortgage already held), the prior lienholder
shall agree not to make advances for purposes other than taxes, insurance or payments on other prior liens without
written consent of the State Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The prior lienholder shall consent to FmHA making (or transferring) the loan and taking (or retaining) the related
mortgage if the prior lien instrument prohibits a loan or mortgage (or transfer) without the prior lienholder's consent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The prior lienholder shall consent to FmHA transferring the property subject to the prior lien after FmHA has
obtained title to the property either by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance if the prior lien instrument prohibits
such transfer without the prior lienholder's consent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of foreclosure agreements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These agreements will be obtained only when required by a state supplement. As a precautionary measure, the state
supplement will require notice agreements when OGC determines that state law permits junior liens of private parties
to be extinguished by foreclosure of a prior lien without the junior lienholder being made parties or being given actual
notice. The state supplement will specify the number of days within which notice of foreclosure is required by the
agreement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Leaseholds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the FmHA security interest is on a leasehold, the approval official must review the lease to make sure that it meets
the security and duration requirements of the program instructions. If not, it will be necessary for the landlord
and tenant to amend the lease to meet these requirements at closing.

Agreement by holder of vendor's interest under land contract. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the buyer's interest in the security property is that of a buyer under a land contract, it will be necessary for the
seller (vendor) to execute, in recordable form, an agreement containing all of the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The vendor shall agree not to sell or voluntarily transfer the vendor's interest under the land contract without
the prior written consent of the FmHA State Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The vendor shall agree not to encumber or cause any liens to be levied against the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The vendor shall agree not to commence or take any action to accelerate, forfeit or foreclose the buyer's interest
in the security property until a specified period of time after notifying the State Director of intent to do so. This
period of time will be ninety (90) days unless a state supplement otherwise provides. The agreement shall give FmHA
the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the buyer's delinquent payments to the vendor, or paying
the vendor in full and having the contract assigned to FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The vendor shall consent to FmHA making the loan and taking a security interest in the borrower's interest under
the land contract as security for the FmHA loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The vendor shall agree not to take any actions to foreclose or forfeit the interest of the buyer under the land contract
because FmHA has acquired the buyer's interest under the land contract by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, or
because FmHA has subsequently sold or assigned the buyer's interest to a third party who will assume the buyer's obligations
under the land contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) When FmHA acquires a buyer's interest under a land contract by voluntary conveyance or foreclosure, FmHA will
not be deemed to have assumed any of the buyer's obligations under the contract, provided that the failure of FmHA to
perform any such obligations while it holds the buyer's interest is a ground to commence an action to terminate the
land contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of agreement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The form of prior lienholder's agreement, forbearance agreement, notice of foreclosure or assignment, and agreement
by holder of vendor's interest under land contract will be prescribed in a state supplement with the concurrence of
OGC. When only forbearance agreements are needed, they will be obtained on Form FmHA 1927&hyph;8, ``Agreement with
Prior Lienholder,'' or, if that form is not legally satisfactory, on a state form having the same title. When only notice
of foreclosure or assignment are required, a separate form for this purpose will be used. When both forbearance agreements
and notices of foreclosure or assignment are required, Form FmHA 1927&hyph;8 may be amended in order to serve both
purposes, a substitute state form may be used for both purposes, or Form FmHA 1927&hyph;8 may be used and the notice
agreement obtained on a separate state form.

Closing the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closing agent will cooperate with the approval official, the borrower and the seller, and other necessary parties
to arrange the time and place of closing. The closing agent will make sure that FmHA obtains a valid mortgage lien on
the property of the priority required by FmHA, subject only to any defects and exceptions approved by the approval
official or State Director. The ``Date of Closing'' will be considered to be the date that the note and mortgage are
signed, and the loan closing process takes place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disbursement of loan funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the closing agent indicates that the conditions necessary to close the loan have been met, loan funds will be forwarded
to the closing agent. Loan funds will not be disbursed prior to filing of the mortgage for record; however, when necessary,
loan funds may be placed in escrow before the mortgage is filed for record and disbursed after it is filed. No development
funds will be kept in escrow by the closing agent after loan closing. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be disbursed
only upon receipt of a discharge, satisfaction, or release (or assignment where necessary to protect the interests
of FmHA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title examination and liens or claims against borrowers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closing agent will examine the title for liens against the property and claims against the borrower from the terminal
date of the preliminary title examination up to and including the time of recording the current mortgage. If there
are no entries of record during the period, except the documents required in connection with title clearance and any
partial release(s) or subordination(s) previously approved by FmHA, the transaction may be closed. If there are
other entries of record during this period, the transaction will not be closed until these entries have been cleared
of record or administratively approved. The closing agent will advise the approval official of the nature of such
intervening instruments and the effect they may have on obtaining a valid mortgage of the priority required or the
title insurance policy to be issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Taxes and assessments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closing agent will determine if all taxes and assessments against the property which are due and payable are paid
at or before the time of loan closing. If the seller and the borrower have agreed to prorate any taxes or assessment which
are not yet due and payable for the year in which the closing of the transaction takes place, the seller's proportionate
share of the taxes and assessments will be deducted from the proceeds to be paid to seller at closing and will be credited
to the amount required to be paid by borrower at closing. Certificates or receipts should be produced from the taxing
authorities to show that taxes or assessments which are due and payable have been paid and, if possible, the certificates
or receipts, or copies, will be kept in the borrower's County Office or District Office case file. Appropriate prorations
as agreed upon between the borrower and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the seller which are applicable to a
period after the closing date, common area maintenance fees, prepaid rentals, insurance (unless the borrower is
to obtain a new policy of insurance) and growing crops.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closing agent will require that a Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5, ``Affidavit Regarding Work of Improvement,'' be completed
and executed (including acknowledgment) when a loan is being made to a borrower who already owns the real estate to
be mortgaged. This affidavit will be executed by the borrower at closing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Execution by seller. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The closing agent will require that Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5 be completed and executed (including acknowledgment)
by the seller when the FmHA is making a loan to a borrower to enable the borrower to acquire the property (including transfers).
This affidavit will be executed by the seller at closing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal insufficiency of affidavit form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5 is not legally sufficient in a particular state, a state form approved by OGC will be used.
A similar form that may be required by a title insurance company may be substituted for Form FmHA 1927&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delay in closing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan will not be closed if, at the loan closing, the seller (in a sale transaction) or the borrower (in a nonpurchase
money loan situation) indicates that construction, repair or remodeling has been commenced or completed on the property,
or related materials or services have been delivered to or performed on the property within the time limit specified
in the affidavit, unless a state supplement otherwise provides. The closing agent will notify the approval official,
who will determine if the work of improvement will result in a lien prior to the FmHA lien. The State Director will, with
the advice and concurrence of OGC, provide in a state supplement the period of time to be used in completing the affidavit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Completion of closing documents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closing agent will determine that deeds, promissory notes, mortgages, releases, and other curative instruments
are completed in accordance with the FMI (sealed and witnessed if required by state law) and, if necessary, acknowledged
and filed for record at the proper time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If Form FmHA 443&hyph;16, ``Assignment of Income from Real Estate Security,'' is required in a particular case, the
approval official will prepare the form and have it available for execution by the borrower when the transaction closes.
The closing agent will see that the form is properly completed, executed (sealed and witnessed if required by state
law), and acknowledged by the borrower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within one day after loan closing, the closing agent will return completed and executed copies of Form FmHA 1927&hyph;15,
the promissory note, all other documents required for loan closing (except the mortgage), and the final title opinion
or policy of title insurance to the approval official. If the recorded mortgage is customarily returned to the borrower
or closing agent after recording, then it must be forwarded to the approval official immediately.

 The attorney will issue a final opinion to FmHA and the borrower on Form FmHA 1927&hyph;10, ``Final Title Opinion.''
If that form is not legally sufficient in a particular state, a state form approved by OGC may be used. Issuance of the
final opinion should not be held up pending the return of recorded instruments. If it is not possible for the final title
opinion to show the book and page of recordation of the FmHA security instrument, the words ``and is recorded'' in paragraph
II B of Form FmHA 1927&hyph;10 may be deleted and the following blank space completed to show the filing office and the
filing instrument number if available. Attached to the final opinion will be required documents then available,
including any which the approval official has furnished to the attorney which were not previously returned. The attorney

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing an amendment to its regulations that would reduce the frequency
of the summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking, which is included in the NRC Regulatory Agenda, from
quarterly to semiannually. The proposed action is necessary because the NRC intends to reduce the publication of
the NRC Regulatory Agenda from quarterly to semiannually as the status of rulemaking actions and petitions for rulemaking
is not subject to frequent change. The proposed rule is intended to reduce the level of NRC staff effort, paperwork,
and distribution costs.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In a letter dated December 30, 1976, Ms. Karen J. Husemeyer submitted a petition for rulemaking with the NRC. The petition
was docketed as PRM&hyph;2&hyph;4, and a notice of receipt was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of February 24, 1977 (42 FR 10911). The petitioner requested that the NRC annually review each petition having a docket
number. The petitioner also requested that the status of proposed rule changes be made part of an administrative report
that would be subject to public review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this petition for rulemaking, the NRC amended its rules of practice governing the receipt and processing
of petitions for rulemaking on October 31, 1977 (42 FR 56950). In the final rule, the NRC stated that it would prepare
a summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking on a quarterly basis and make this report available for public
inspection and copying in the Public Document Room. The provision concerning the preparation and availability of
the summary report on petitions for rulemaking is codified at 10 CFR 2.802(g). This report was published under the
heading ``NRC Petitions for Rulemaking'' until April 29, 1982, when it was incorporated into the NRC Regulatory Agenda
and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(47 FR 18508). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 9, 1979, the Commission also requested that a quarterly summary be prepared for rulemaking efforts not
associated with petitions for rulemaking. The NRC staff prepared a report that indicated the status of proposed rules
and advance notices of proposed rulemaking for the period of January through March 1980. Although this was a one-time
report, the Commission later recommended that the report be updated each quarter. This report was published under
the heading ``Status of Proposed Rules.'' It was subsequently replaced by the NRC Regulatory Agenda, first published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on October 29, 1981 (46 FR 53594).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC Regulatory Agenda is a compilation of all rules on which the NRC has recently completed action, has proposed
action, or is considering action, and all petitions for rulemaking that have been received by the Commission and are
pending disposition. The NRC Regulatory Agenda provides the public with basic information regarding currently
active NRC rulemaking activities and petitions for rulemaking. Since 1982, the NRC Regulatory Agenda has been updated
and issued each quarter as NUREG&hyph;0936.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC also prepares and submits an agenda of its rulemaking activity for inclusion in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations, which is updated semiannually and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602) requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas describing
the regulatory actions they are developing that could have an impact on small entities. Executive Order 12866 establishes
minimum standards for an agency's agenda, including specific types of information for each entry and publication
in a uniform format. The NRC meets these public information requirements through its participation in the Unified
Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations contains the same information concerning
the NRC rulemaking activity that is published in the NRC Regulatory Agenda.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the continued publication of the NRC Regulatory Agenda on a quarterly basis is unnecessary.
The content and the status of the rulemaking actions and petitions for rulemaking do not change frequently enough
to justify a quarterly publication. The NRC believes that a semiannual publication schedule is sufficient to inform
the public of the NRC's rulemaking activity and of the current status of NRC's active rulemakings and petitions for
rulemaking. The NRC Regulatory Agenda would continue to be published in January and July of each year. Section 2.802(g),
which concerns the frequency of the status of petitions for rulemaking, would be revised to reflect this change. The
NRC would continue to publish an updated agenda of its rulemaking actions in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations
each April and October.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To better inform the public of the status of NRC rulemakings, the NRC is exploring alternatives to make the information
in the Regulatory Agenda available through electronic communications, such as via an electronic bulletin board.
The NRC will make its next issuance of the Regulatory Agenda available in an electronic format on an electronic board
that is accessible to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also the NRC has established a computer bulletin board whereby the public can obtain a copy of the proposed rule entitled,
``Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities,'' and submit comments on this proposed rule
via electronic communication. The NRC is exploring mechanisms to make this type of public access to rulemakings available
for additional rulemakings in the future. In addition, the NRC routinely invites the public to submit comments on
proposed rules in an electronic format.

Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that this proposed regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR
51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared
for this proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule contains no information collection requirements and therefore is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

Regulatory Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has not prepared a regulatory impact analysis for this proposed rule because it is an administrative action
that would reduce the frequency of the summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking, as included in the
NRC Regulatory Agenda, from quarterly to semiannually.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that, if promulgated,
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is an administrative
action that would reduce the frequency of the summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking, as included
in the NRC Regulatory Agenda, from quarterly to semiannually. This proposed action would have no economic impact
on any NRC license, including small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and, therefore, that
a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions that
would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a Federal court decision, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is evaluating its approaches for
designation of persons who should be subject to the random drug testing at nuclear power plants, in particular whether
employees without direct safety-related duties (e.g., clerical staff) must be subject to random testing. In the
evaluation, the NRC staff identified several issues that have a significant bearing on whether the current approach
should be revised. Public comments are requested on these issues to aid the NRC staff in completing their evaluation.
If any changes are developed to current regulations as a consequence of this evaluation, these proposed changes will

 966 F.2d 521 (9th Cir. 1992), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the NRC's denial of a request
by the IBEW on behalf of Diablo Canyon's nuclear workers for an exemption from NRC's random drug-testing requirements.
The labor union requested the exemption for bargaining unit members in clerical, maintenance, and warehouse positions.
While declining to upset the exemption denial on the record before the court, the three-judge panel questioned the
NRC's justification for imposing random drug tests on workers (particularly routine clerical workers) with no direct
safety functions and no authorized unescorted access to the vital areas of the plant. (The Diablo Canyon administrative
building is in the protected area, and administrative workers are subject to random drug testing because they have
unescorted access to the protected area. A number of other plants also have administrative buildings inside their
protected areas.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Court of Appeals affirmed the exemption denial, the NRC is under no immediate legal obligation to take
any action. However, the NRC believes that a careful study of the issue raised by the court is in order. Therefore, the
NRC staff conducted an initial study, ``Evaluation of Scope of Persons Subject to Random Drug Testing'' (Enclosure
1 to SECY&hyph;94&hyph;016), which is available in the Public Document Room as specified in the ADDRESSES portion
of this Notice. This study evaluated issues relative to random drug-testing of clerks, secretaries, or other employees
who have unescorted access to a nuclear plant's protected area, but whose own jobs are not directly safety-related
and provide no opportunity for precipitating or escalating a safety-related incident at a nuclear power plant.

Before the effective implementation date of the Fitness-For-Duty (FFD) Rule (January 3, 1990), licensees had various
programs to control substance abuse. However, these programs were not uniform in their procedures, testing methods,
standards, or sanctions for substance abuse. Most of the programs did include (1) preemployment drug testing, (2)
for-cause drug testing, (3) employee assistance programs, (4) behavioral observation, and (5) some type of training
on the problems associated with substance abuse. Not all licensees had random drug testing as an element of their program;
in some cases, random testing was precluded because of union intervention or prohibition by State laws.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the FFD Rule, the scope of random drug testing was one issue that received considerable attention. In
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for the proposed rule published on September 22, 1988 (53 FR 36795), the Commission solicited comments on the
appropriateness of the worker categories identified for testing. At 53 FR 36817, the Commission indicated that it
was proposing that the rule apply to all persons who have been granted unescorted access to protected areas because
(1) current programs are implemented in accordance with the Commission's Policy Statement on Fitness-for-Duty
of Nuclear Power Plant Personnel published on August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27921), which applies to all persons within protected
areas at nuclear power plants; (2) these persons could introduce and sell/distribute drugs in the workplace; and
(3) any person under the influence of these substances could cause a safety hazard, if not to the general public, to
the user and to fellow workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the public comments on the proposed rule addressed the scope of random testing. Most comments supported random
testing for all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas. However, a considerable number of comments
objected to random testing provisions of the rule. A number of the comments asserted that random testing was unnecessary
and that many of the individuals granted unescorted access to protected areas have no potential for precipitating
or escalating a safety-related incident. Some comments recommended that only those workers who may potentially
affect the health and safety of the public be covered. For the final rule, the NRC chose not to reduce the scope of persons
subject to random testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the FFD Rule requires licensees authorized to operate or construct a nuclear power reactor to implement
an FFD program that applies to ``all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas, and to licensee, vendor,
or contractor personnel required to physically report to a licensee's Technical Support Center (TSC) or Emergency
Operations Facility (EOF) in accordance with the licensee's emergency plans and procedures.'' Licensees authorized
to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of nuclear material were recently required to initiate FFD programs
and are not included in this analysis. Persons who come under the FFD program are subject to the drug testing provisions,
which include random drug tests.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Random drug testing involves two distinct functions: (1) Random selection of persons to be tested, and (2) collection
and analysis of test specimens. The random selection process is used to ensure that all persons subject to drug testing
will have an equal probability of selection for testing at any time. Random drug testing is also a very strong deterrent
to substance abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the FFD Rule, the NRC decided to specify random drug testing because of a concern about the threat that
substance-impaired workers posed to the public health and safety. Based upon comments received during rulemaking,
the Commission concluded that all workers with unescorted access to protected areas of operating nuclear power plants
should be included within the scope of the rule. However, some workers have argued that they do not perform safety-related
functions and have now questioned whether random testing is an undue encroachment on individual expectations of
privacy. See

, 966 F. 2d 521 (9th Cir. 1992). Other viewpoints contend that expectations of privacy are diminished when workers
apply for and accept jobs in the nuclear industry because job applicants willingly agree to significant privacy encroachments
including preemployment urinalysis tests, detailed background investigations, security and fingerprint checks
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, credit checks, and psychological assessments. Accordingly, the Commission
is now reassessing the scope of random urinalysis testing as applied to workers without safety-related duties to
ensure a proper balance between safeguarding individual rights and the Commission's responsibility to protect
public health and safety.

At nuclear power reactors, the safety risks from someone using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol arise from the potential
for that person to inadvertently or deliberately take actions that could affect plant safety. The safety risks from
inadvertent acts primarily involve impairment caused by substance abuse and the effect of that impairment on the
person's ability to perform safety-related functions. Although the Commission has no information that would indicate
that a person is more susceptible to coercion or blackmail due to drug abuse than from any other activity, there is a
perception that the safety risks from deliberate acts come from the susceptibility of a substance abuser to be coerced
or influenced into deliberately damaging a nuclear power plant, whether or not that person has safety-related duties.
For example, the person could lose their inhibitions while under the influence or could be blackmailed into some act
against the plant by someone aware of that person's substance abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objective data establishes a relationship between substance abuse, impairment, and inadvertent acts [NUREG/CR&hyph;5227,
``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: A Review of Technical Issues''], but the staff's review of the relevant
literature suggests that insufficient scientific data exist to directly link substance abuse to the performance
of deliberate (or malicious) acts. However, it has been clearly shown that, as human error rates increase, the risks
to plant safety will increase significantly. [See NUREG/CR&hyph;1879, ``Sensitivity of Risk Parameters to Human
Errors in Reactor Safety Studies for a PWR.''] It has also been shown that substance abuse can sufficiently impair
a worker's motor skills and judgment that accidents attributable to neglect and human error become significantly
more probable. [See NUREG/CR&hyph;5227 and Supplement 1 to NUREG/CR&hyph;5227.]

Information reported to the Commission indicates that arrests for sale and distribution of illegal substances inside
nuclear power plant protected areas have decreased markedly since January 1990 when the FFD Rule was implemented.
Prior to the FFD Rule, a number of cases involving the sale and distribution of illegal substances at nuclear power
plants were reported, as described in the staff's report cited previously. The persons arrested for on-site sale
and distribution of drugs included both safety-related and non-safety-related workers. The job categories included
clerks, custodial workers, craftpersons, and engineers. Since implementation of the FFD Rule, however, only one
case of this type has been reported to the Commission by a nuclear power plant licensee. Two of the more significant
deterrents added by the FFD Rule were: (1) The requirement for random drug testing, and (2) the five-year minimum revocation
of unescorted access for persons determined to have been involved in the sale, use, or possession of illegal drugs
within a protected area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The threat of someone either inadvertently or deliberately damaging or manipulating equipment that affects plant
operations or could result in radiological consequences arises from that person having access to the equipment.
Persons whose tasks involve design, operation, or maintenance of that equipment represent a greater potential threat
because of their familiarity and more direct access to that equipment. Safeguard measures that protect against someone
from inside the organization are intended to counter this threat by ensuring that persons who have an opportunity
to operate or manipulate any equipment affecting plant functions are not impaired and are trustworthy and reliable.
To achieve these goals, the Commission believes that although there are substantial unknowns currently associated
with the true detection and deterrence effectiveness of random testing, the use of random drug testing provides an
effective means for both detecting and deterring the use of illegal drugs or abuse of alcohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fundamental approaches for selecting those to be included in a random testing program are to either test everyone
(the ``universal'' approach) or to test only those in ``safety-sensitive'' positions. Proponents of the universal
approach contend that the safety-sensitive approach tends to be discriminatory in that blue-collar workers are
tested but management is not. Proponents of the safety-sensitive approach contend that random testing should be
limited to only workers in positions where a direct link to safety exists. The NRC's current approach is a combination
of these two fundamental approaches. The NRC's approach tests everyone who has unescorted access to a protected area
and, therefore, tests everyone who has an opportunity to operate or manipulate important systems and equipment that
could challenge the safe operation or emergency shutdown capability of a nuclear power plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To satisfy the intended objective of random drug testing, one approach would be to base the decision on who should be
randomly tested on a person's access to equipment that could, if manipulated, cause a safety problem. This is a conservative
approach and does not take into account the abilities and skills of persons who may have access. For someone who has
access and whose tasks do not include safety-related activities, the approach assumes they present some risk of either
inadvertently or deliberately causing safety problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear power plant security requirements provide distinct security boundaries where personnel access is controlled.
The nuclear power plant protected area is one of these boundaries and is defined as an area encompassed by physical
barriers to which access is controlled (10 CFR 73.2). Protected areas contain components and systems that are important
to plant operations and whose failure could result in challenges to more critical plant systems and components. The
NRC staff's evaluation study cites numerous cases where reactors have been tripped and safety systems challenged
as a result of accidents that occurred in protected areas. Since 1987, there have been over two thousand ``events''
that caused reactors to be scrammed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within protected areas are vital areas. Vital areas contain equipment, systems, devices, or material, the failure,
destruction, or release of which could directly or indirectly endanger the public health and safety by exposure to
radiation. Unescorted access from protected areas into vital areas is controlled and limited to persons who require
access to perform their duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An approach based on unescorted access to protected areas results in a large variation among sites in the number of
people subject to random testing. Many power reactor sites have few administrative or technical work stations inside
their protected areas. At these sites, most workers who have unescorted access also have job functions directly related
to plant operations and require access to one or more vital areas. However, a number of power reactor sites have administrative
and technical support buildings located inside protected areas. At these sites, many workers who have unescorted
access only to protected areas (and not to vital areas) do not have tasks directly related to plant operations or maintenance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another approach to designating who would be subject to random testing would be to base the decision on tasks the person
performs. This approach recognizes that people whose tasks directly involve plant safety have the access, the opportunity,
and the knowledge to cause a safety problem. This approach addresses more directly the safety problems that might
be caused by a person who is impaired due to substance abuse. Many positions and tasks are fairly well defined at nuclear
facilities. A core of individuals such as plant operators, maintenance personnel, and quality control inspectors
have tasks that are clearly subject to NRC regulations and directly involve safety-related activities. However,
the relationship of some positions to plant safety is more difficult to establish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One ongoing NRC activity that could affect considerations for changes in regulatory requirements for persons subject
to random testing is a study of security requirements associated with the insider threat. There have been some indications
that access control safeguards could, in some circumstances, make it much harder for reactor operators to maintain
control of a plant. The NRC staff is considering whether reductions are possible in the safeguards that control access
into vital areas from protected areas. Substantial reductions in the access control safeguards for vital areas could
alter the safety impact assessments for optional approaches to random drug testing. These safety assessments are
based to some degree on the use of access controls to segregate persons having access to vital areas from persons whose
access is limited to protected areas (i.e., persons who do not have access to vital areas). Depending on how much importance
is given to concerns about deliberate acts based on influence from illegal drug or alcohol abuse, future relaxation
of the safeguards to control access into vital areas from protected areas could significantly affect any considerations
for narrowing the scope of persons subject to random testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in the ongoing evaluation of the scope of random testing, the Commission seeks comments on the proposed alternative
approaches to the scope of random testing and other related issues. Further information on these alternative approaches
is contained in the NRC staff's report cited previously. This study addressed five options for the scope of random
testing. The first option is maintaining the existing random drug testing scope, which is based on personnel access
to a particular location. Option 2, which would exclude certain groups of workers from the random testing pool, and
Option 3, which would apply random testing to persons who have access only to vital areas, represent relatively simple
variations of the current program. Options 2 and 3 would narrow the pool of individuals subject to random testing.
Option 4 would base the scope of random testing on the tasks the person performs. Option 5 would allow alternative testing
(in lieu of urinalysis) for workers in certain defined positions. For all five options, it is assumed that the other
elements of the FFD program (such as suitable inquiries, preaccess testing, and for-cause testing) will remain applicable
to all workers who are given unescorted access to protected areas. Specifically, comments are requested on the following:

a. Exclude from random drug testing certain groups of workers (e.g., clerical, administrative) who have unescorted
access to protected areas but not to vital areas. (Option 2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Limit random drug testing to only those workers who have unescorted access to vital areas of nuclear power plants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Allow use of alternative testing methods in lieu of urinalysis for certain groups of workers who have unescorted
access to protected areas (but not to vital areas) only because their normal workstations are within a protected area
of the nuclear power plant. These methods could include performance-based testing, even though there are current
technical limitations, primarily varying degrees of detectability, reliability, sensitivity, and accuracy.
(See also question 7, below.) (Option 5)

3. For each of the four approaches above (2.a&hyph;2.d), what are the potential effects on risk to public health and
safety or on vulnerability of nuclear power plants resulting from accidental acts and deliberate acts such as sabotage
or vandalism? Will vulnerability or risk increase or decrease to any significant degree, or will they remain unchanged?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What would be the expected effect on the need for random drug testing under each of the four approaches above (2.a&hyph;2.d)
if vital area access controls are reduced ( e.g., allowing certain vital area doors to normally be unlocked, but be
capable of (i) being remotely locked on demand in the event of a security contingency, and (ii) generating an alarm
if a vital area door is opened without an authorized keycard )? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Does substance abuse increase the probability of a person committing a deliberate act such as sabotage or vandalism?
These acts might be caused by indirect influences of drugs on a person's attitude or susceptibility to being influenced
by others. What data exist to show a relationship between substance abuse and deliberate acts? Is random drug testing
an appropriate means to control the risk of deliberate acts associated with substance abuse and, at the same time,
not encroach unreasonably into individual privacy expectations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Does the Commission's policy in 10 CFR part 26 deter the introduction of illegal substances into protected areas
of nuclear power plants? If so, what aspect(s) of the FFD program creates this deterrent effect? If not, should the
Commission require licensees to implement measures to cause this deterrent effect, and what type of measures should
be required? (Information describing the measures and their effectiveness in sufficient detail to show the cause
and effect relationship between the deterrent measure and the resulting reduction/elimination of illegal substances
being brought into the workplace would be useful.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Should the Commission continue to investigate new testing methods that could be used for all workers who have unescorted
access to protected areas? What are some methods that might be acceptable and effective alternatives to the existing
approach? For proposed methods, please provide data that establishes accuracy (i.e., test's error rate), specificity
(i.e., degree to which the test can measure what it's supposed to measure), reliability (i.e., the precision with
which the test can be repeated and the consistency of test results), and similar supporting parameters. The Commission
is specifically interested in data on the validity of performance testing measures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Truth in Savings Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) requires depository institutions to provide disclosures to consumers about their deposit
accounts, including an APY on interest-bearing accounts. The law also contains rules about advertising deposit
accounts, including accounts at depository institutions offered to consumers by deposit brokers. The act is implemented
by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective June 21, 1993. (See final rule published on September
21, 1992 (57 FR 43337), correction notice published on October 5, 1992 (57 FR 46480), and amendments published on March
19, 1993 (58 FR 15077). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its initial rulemaking, the Board was guided by several general principles, such as establishing simple rules
that minimize the possibility of errors and compliance costs and providing institutions with flexibility to promote
a variety of product choices for consumers. This included designing a simple, easy-to-use formula for calculating
the APY. As deposit brokers and institutions began complying with the new formula, the Board was asked by the Securities
Industry Association (SIA) and others to reconsider how the APY is calculated. Proposed amendments that would provide
for an additional APY formula were published on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64190). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difficulties associated with the current APY formula stem from the formula's assumption that interest paid on
an account remains on deposit until maturity. For some accounts, the formula produces an APY that reflects the time
value of interest received.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For others the APY fails to reflect the time value of interest received. This happens in cases where institutions offer
long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) that are noncompounding but pay interest periodically. In this case, the
formula produces an APY that is less than the contract interest rate.

For example, assume $1,000 is deposited in a one-year CD with a 6% interest rate that compounds quarterly. Consumers
have the option to receive quarterly interest checks instead. In both cases, the APY is 6.14%, even though the consumer
who compounds interest receives $61.40, and the consumer who takes quarterly interest checks receives $60.00.

For example, assume $1,000 is deposited in a two-year noncompounding CD with a 6.00% interest rate. Some institutions
may offer the consumer the choice of receiving all interest ($120) at maturity, or receiving two interest payments
($60) each year. The APY in either case is 5.83%_lower than the 6.00% interest rate_because the formula looks at the
total amount of interest paid, not when it is paid out. The SIA states the maturities of CDs purchased through deposit
brokers range from three months to 10 years but average about two years (based on dollar-weighted maturities).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering whether to propose amendments to the APY formula, the Board focused on two issues: a desire for an APY
that reflects the time value of money, and a concern about the compliance costs and impact on depository institutions
if changes were made. The Board published a proposal that would factor into the APY calculation the specific time intervals
for interest paid on the account_that is, the time value of money (Approach A). However, the Board also requested comment
on a narrower approach that would affect only noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually.
For these accounts, the APY would never be lower than the interest rate (Approach B). The Board also solicited comment
on leaving the regulation unchanged (Approach C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board received about 500 comments on its proposal. Nearly 90% of the comments were from financial institutions.
Considering all comments received, approximately 5% supported Approach A; 15% supported Approach B; and 75% supported
Approach C. The remainder presented other alternatives or expressed no opinion on the specific approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Approach A: Proposal of an Additional Formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the comments received and upon further analysis, the Board is withdrawing the proposed amendments to the
APY formula. Overall, the Board believes that the proposed formula (Approach A) would be complex and costly to implement,
and the costs would outweigh the benefits derived from the proposed changes. (See Docket R&hyph;0836 elsewhere in
today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for proposed amendments which the Board believes might better capture the intent of the act's purposes in a less complex
way.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes the formula proposed in December would correct the APY anomalies produced by the current formula,
and has considered the view of some commenters that the short-term costs of correcting the formula might be worthwhile
over time. However, the Board is more persuaded by the commenters_including both consumer groups and industry associations_that
believed the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits from implementing the proposed APY formula. Commenters reported
that substantial costs recently had been incurred to implement the regulation, and they believed the distinctions
in the APY produced by the complex formula proposed by Approach A did not warrant the substantial costs of implementing
changes to the regulation_perhaps as much as 50% of the initial costs to implement the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board concurs with the commenters that voiced concern about the complexity of the proposed formula. These commenters
noted that the formula was complex for both consumers and institutions. Many commenters stated that although an internal
rate of return formula is a standard mathematical tool in the financial markets, its introduction in APY calculations
would eliminate, as a practical matter, the use of many handheld calculators for preparing disclosures or quoting
APYs to consumers. Commenters also noted due to the complexity of the APY calculation there would be an increased risk
of error and potential civil liability in making this calculation for a wide variety of accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also notes the views of commenters that believed that in adopting Approach A, the Board would merely be trading
one set of assumptions for another set of assumptions. Many commenters concurred with the Board that the current APY
does not always reflect the value of periodic interest distributions, for example. But they also believed that the
proposed APY also would not be factually accurate in all circumstances. For example, commenters remarked that the
proposed APY would fail to reflect the fact that interest payments cannot always be immediately reinvested at the
same rate as the account from which the interest was paid. They also believed it would be inappropriate to assume such
a reinvestment rate for small monthly interest checks, for example, since rates typically rise based on the length
of maturity and amount of principal. They noted that elderly consumers who hold multi-year CDs and who rely on periodic
interest payments for living expenses would be particularly affected by the assumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters noted that returns on deposit accounts traditionally have been based on the rate of interest paid and any
compounding frequency. Higher yields historically have been equated with higher dollar interest payments_not
more frequent interest payments_and commenters believed that consumers expect an APY to reflect those factors.
Many commenters believed that the underlying premise of Approach A_the time value of money_is inappropriate for
deposit account disclosures. Many believed an assumption based on potential earnings outside the account relationship
was misleading for the APY calculation. They believed the purposes of Truth in Savings are not best served by an APY
disclosure based on the timing of interest payments that is higher for consumers who receive less interest overall.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to concerns about costs and questions about the benefits provided, the Board believes this approach would not
be the best solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Approach B: Noncompounding Multi-Year CDs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also is not adopting Approach B, based on the combination of the limited scope of the problem Approach B seeks
to address, the creation of new anomalies, and the cost to the industry of reviewing and implementing new calculation
and disclosure requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the one hand, the Board believes Approach B is a simple, direct approach to correct one anomaly produced by the current
APY formula. The Board also recognizes that the disclosure of an APY that is lower than the interest rate on a noncompounding
multi-year CD that pays interest at least annually may be confusing to some consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board notes, however, that even if Approach B were adopted, institutions would still disclose an APY lower than
the interest rate, such as for a multi-year CD that does not compound and pays interest only at maturity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall, however, the Board is more persuaded by commenters that voiced concern about the accuracy of the APY disclosed
under Approach B. For example, commenters echoed concerns expressed about the proposed formula in Approach A. They
remarked that the APY permitted under Approach B assumed the interest payments received during the term would be reinvested
at the same rate as the account from which the interest was paid. Others believed it would be anomalous to disclose the
same APY is disclosed for two multi-year accounts, one compounding annually and the other not compounding at all.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also notes the commenters' concerns about the cost to the industry of reviewing and implementing new calculation
and disclosure requirements. They noted the costs of implementing Approach B would be less significant, compared
to Approach A. Although the change would affect a single class of accounts, commenters reported that some computer
programming changes would be required and additional disclosures would be appropriate. Commenters stated that
since consumers would see the same APY for compounding and noncompounding CDs, a statement might be necessary in advertisements
and account disclosures to help consumers understand the terms of the account. (For example, assume two institutions
offer a two-year CD with a 6.00% interest rate. One compounds annually, the other offers annual interest payments.
Both could advertise a 6.00% APY, even though a consumer depositing $1,000 receives $120 if interest checks are paid
and $123.60 if interest is compounded.) Finally, the Board notes some commenters remarked that institutions could
easily remedy the current anomaly with a simple change to their product. They noted institutions could advertise
and disclose an APY equal to the contract interest rate under the current formula by offering CDs that have annual compounding,
regardless of any payment options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the limited problem Approach B seeks to address, the limited resolution of anomalies produced by the current
APY formula, and the costs associated with adopting the approach, the Board has determined not to adopt Approach B.

(3) Regulatory flexibility analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board solicited comment on the potential cost of implementing the proposed APY formula, such as the proportion
of existing accounts would require the new formula for computing APYs, the changes institutions would have to make
to implement the new formula, the cost to make these changes, and the likelihood of changes in the number of different
account terms and types of accounts offered would result if the new formula were adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions were reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the
Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of comments received during the public comment period.
The Board's Office of the Secretary has prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed revisions to Regulation
DD, a copy of which may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington,
DC 20551, at (202) 452&hyph;3245.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Regulation DD (Truth in Savings) which clarify that once
interest is credited to an account, it becomes part of the principal. By defining terms such as ``crediting,'' and
``compounding,'' the amendments will provide certainty to institutions, better fulfill the purposes of the act,
and eliminate anomalies that currently occur in the APY calculation. The amendments provide that for institutions
that pay interest (that is, credit interest) to the consumer by check or transfer or permit interest to remain in the
account, an institution must pay interest on funds that remain in the account at the same frequency as the institution
credits interest by check or transfer. Accounts that credit interest solely by posting to the account would not be
required to send out interest checks or to transfer the interest to other accounts. Similarly, institutions offering
accounts that ``credit'' interest solely by paying it out to the consumer by check or transfer would not be required
to permit credited interest to remain in the account for compounding.

) requires depository institutions to provide disclosures to consumers about their deposit accounts, including
an annual percentage yield (APY) on interest-bearing accounts. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation
DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective June 21, 1993 (See 57 FR 43337 and 58 FR 15077). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the current formula for calculating the APY assumes that interest remains on deposit until maturity, the
resulting APY may_but does not always_reflect the time value of money. On December 6, 1993, the Board published a proposal
that would have factored into the APY calculation the specific time intervals for interest paid on the account_that
is, the time value of money (58 FR 64190). It called for adding an additional APY formula. Based on the comments received
and upon further analysis, the Board has withdrawn the proposed amendments. (See Docket R&hyph;0812 elsewhere in

.) Compounding and crediting issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of deliberations about the APY proposal, the Board has considered two related issues regarding depository
institutions' compounding and crediting practices. This relationship between crediting and compounding has not
previously been addressed in the regulation or in supplementary information. (The resolution of these issues, as
discussed below, could provide an alternative basis for eliminating the anomaly produced by the current formula
while requiring few changes to the current APY formula.)

that this requirement shall not be construed as prohibiting or requiring the use of any particular method of compounding
or crediting interest. Regulation DD states that the requirement to pay interest on the full amount of principal does
not require institutions to compound or credit interest at any particular frequency. Neither the act nor the regulation
defines ``compounding,'' ``crediting,'' or ``principal.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue that has arisen is whether interest can be posted to a consumer's account and not be treated as part of the principal.
Another is whether institutions that offer to credit interest to the consumer by check or transfer and permit interest
to remain in the account must credit and compound interest on the same or a more frequent basis for those consumers that
leave interest in the account. For example, if an institution offers a two-year certificate of deposit (CD) and permits
consumers to receive accrued interest in monthly interest checks, does the institution that also permits interest
to remain in the account have to credit and compound interest in the account on the same or more frequent basis (monthly
or more often). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes that institutions may have read the act and regulation as permitting practices which compound
and credit at different intervals. The Board is proposing to amend the regulation to clarify that interest cannot
be credited to a consumer's account without becoming part of the principal. For example, assume a consumer earns $5
in interest on a $1,000 balance for the month of January. If an institution chooses to credit interest to the account
monthly, then the institution must accrue interest on that sum. For example, if $5 is credited in January to an account
with a balance of $1,000, the institution must accrue interest on $1,005 for the month of February. Simply put, if consumers
are given access to earned interest in an account, the Board believes the act requires that consumers earn interest
on those funds at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also proposes an amendment clarifying that although institutions may choose any compounding or crediting
frequency for an account, institutions that provide for crediting interest either by check (or transfer of accrued
interest to another account) or by posting interest to the account must do so on the same periodic basis. That is, if
interest can be ``credited'' by check or transfer, an institution must credit interest to all such accounts at least
as often a frequency. For example, an institution offering a one-year CD with the option to receive monthly or quarterly
interest checks would have to credit interest to the account for compounding on at least a monthly frequency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, an institution need not permit consumers to receive interest payments by check or transfer. Similarly,
the Board believes that if an institution requires consumers to receive interest solely by check (or transfer to another
account), the institution need not also permit consumers to leave interest in the account for compounding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that this proposed interpretation could require a change in the compounding and crediting practices
of some depository institutions, since institutions that do not currently compound on the same basis as they offer
interest payments would have to change compounding frequencies or reduce payment options. The impact of the proposed
amendments may be greater for those institutions offering consumers many options in crediting frequencies. For
example, an institution permitting quarterly interest payments must also credit and compound at least quarterly
for those consumers who choose to leave interest in the account. If an institution allows consumers to receive monthly
interest checks (and can leave interest in the account), the institution could not offer this option without offering
monthly crediting and compounding to other holders of the same account as well. The Board requests comment on these
matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also solicits comments on whether consumers who use APYs to comparison shop may be confused by an APY that
reflects monthly compounding but pays less interest than if interest had compounded in the account. For example,
assume two institutions offer a one-year CD with a 6.00% interest rate. One mandates monthly interest checks, the
other permits monthly interest checks or monthly compounding. Both could advertise a 6.17% APY, even though a consumer
depositing $1,000 receives $60 if interest checks are paid and $61.70 if money is left in the account.

(2) Proposed Regulatory Revisions: Section-by-Section Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A section-by-section description of proposed amendments follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->

Paragraph (c)_Annual Percentage Yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act and regulation define the APY as the total amount of interest that would be received based on the interest rate
and the frequency of compounding for a 365-day year. The proposed amendment broadens the definition to treat crediting
to the consumer's account_which includes the distribution of interest through interest checks or transfer_as the
equivalent of compounding. For example, if an institution pays a 6.00% interest rate on an account, the same APY would
result whether an institution compounds monthly or solely sends out monthly interest payments and does not permit
interest to remain in the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board solicits comments on whether an exception should be made to the definition of APY, and whether the purpose
of the regulation_enabling consumers to make informed decisions about deposit accounts_is better met if the APY
captures the time value of interest received as an interest payment during the term of the account, as well as by compounding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h)_Compounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act and regulation require institutions to disclose compounding policies for interest-bearing accounts. The
Board proposes to define the term ``compounding'' as the frequency that earned interest is added to the principal
in the consumer's account, on which interest then accrues. To illustrate, a CD offering monthly compounding adds
interest to principal each month, and interest then accrues on the new month's principal_including the prior month's
accrued interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (j)_Crediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act and regulation also require institutions to disclose crediting policies for interest-bearing accounts.
The Board proposes to define the term ``crediting'' to include the frequency that earned interest is paid to the account,
or provided to the consumer by check or transfer to another account. Thus, for example, an institution that sends a
consumer a monthly check of accrued interest would be crediting interest monthly, even if interest were not permitted
to remain in the account to earn additional interest.

Paragraph (b)(6)(iii)_Withdrawal of Interest Prior to Maturity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation requires a disclosure for institutions offering time accounts that compound interest and permit
a consumer to withdraw accrued interest during the account term. The disclosure states that the APY assumes interest
remains on deposit until maturity and that a withdrawal will reduce earnings. The Board requests comment on whether
the disclosure would continue to be helpful to consumers in the current form if the proposed amendments are adopted.

Payment of Interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)_Compounding and Crediting Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act requires institutions to pay interest on the full amount of the principal in the account each day, and provides
that this requirement shall not be construed as prohibiting or requiring the use of any particular method of compounding
or crediting interest. Regulation DD states that the requirement to pay interest on the full amount of principal does
not require institutions to compound or credit interest at any particular frequency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the Board believes institutions may choose any compounding or crediting frequency. However,
once interest is credited to an account it becomes part of the principal, and if interest remains in the account, interest
must be paid on those funds. The Board believes institutions may choose to offer accounts that credit interest solely
by posting interest to the account, or by sending interest checks or transferring the interest to another account.
But the Board also believes institutions offering accounts that provide consumers with the option to have interest
credited by check (or transfer to another account) or by posting interest to the account provide at least as frequent
a crediting frequency to all holders of the same account. That is, institutions must compound interest on funds remaining
in the account at a frequency no less often than interest is offered to be credited_by check or transfer_to other consumers
holding such accounts. For example, institutions may offer a one-year CD with monthly compounding and the option
to receive monthly or quarterly interest checks, but they may not combine quarterly compounding with the option to
receive monthly interest checks. The Board requests comment on the proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to Appendix A only affect institutions that credit interest solely by check or transfer to
another account (and that do not permit the consumer to leave interest in the account). The Board proposes two amendments
to Appendix A to address the calculation of the APY for these accounts. First, the Board proposes to delete footnote
3 as unnecessary. Second, the definition of ``Interest'' in the APY formula would be amended to provide that for such
accounts, institutions would factor in the timing of interest payments as if interest were being compounded. For
example, if an institution offers a two-year CD with a 6.00% interest rate and credits interest semi-annually to the
consumer by check or transfer to another account, the ``Interest'' figure used in the APY formula would be $125.51
on a $1,000 deposit. This would be the dollar amount of interest earned for a two-year CD with a 6.00% interest rate that
compounds semi-annually. The APY would be 6.09%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Board also provides guidance on two assumptions for calculating the APY that provide greater flexibility
and ease compliance with the APY formula. First, institutions could calculate the APY by assuming an initial deposit
amount of $1,000. Second, if interest is paid out monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually, institutions could base
the number of days either on the actual number of days for those intervals or on an assumed number of days (30 days for
monthly distributions, 91 days for quarterly distributions, and 182 days for semiannual distributions).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board solicits comment on whether consumers who are comparison shopping would be better served if the specific
manner in which interest is credited (such as, ``An annual percentage yield of 6.17% with monthly interest checks'')
should be stated along with the APY. (See &sect;&sect;230.3(e), 4(a)(ii), 4(b)(1)(i), 5(b), 8(b).)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, assume a one-year CD that pays an interest rate of 6.00%. Consumers would receive an APY of 6.17% if the
institution requires monthly interest payments. Or, if the institution permits interest to be withdrawn monthly
instead, the proposed amendments would also require institutions to permit interest to remain in the account for
monthly compounding. Consumers holding this account would also receive an APY of 6.17% whether the consumer chooses
to take monthly interest checks or to have interest remain in the account. However, based on a $1,000 deposit consumers
who receive interest checks will earn $60.00, while those who compound interest will earn $61.70.

Compounding and crediting frequencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulation requires institutions to disclose the frequency with which interest is compounded and credited.
This standard would require institutions also to specify the crediting frequency for interest payments sent directly
to the consumer or to another account, whether by check or other means, as well as when interest is credited to the account.
The Board solicits comment on the proposed disclosure and on whether stating the frequency of crediting by interest
payments or transfers to other accounts is likely to help consumers compare and understand differences in account
terms. (See &sect;230.4(b)(2).)

(6) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's Office of the Secretary has prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed revisions to Regulation
DD. The analysis expresses concern about the desirability of amending the regulation regarding the linkage of compounding
and crediting frequencies at this time. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, at (202) 452&hyph;3245. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board solicits information regarding the likely costs for complying with the proposed changes to the regulation.
In particular, the Board solicits comments on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What proportion of existing accounts would be affected by the proposed new rule requiring institutions to
offer compounding on the same frequency as they permit interest payouts? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What changes would institutions have to make to implement the proposed new compounding and crediting rule,
and what would it cost institutions to make these changes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What changes in the number of different account terms and types of accounts offered would result if the proposal
were adopted? For example, would institutions reduce the number of products offered? What effect would the amendments
have on ``private banking'' relationships? Would institutions change from compounding to distributing the interest
paid on accounts without compounding? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to
the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of comments received during the public comment

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require modification of the power supply for the communications system. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal is prompted by reports of loss of power to the communications system due to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical fault in the ground crew jack box or the handset of the public address (PA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the inability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flight crew to communicate with passengers via the PA system and with air traffic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control due to loss of power to the communication system, which may lead to unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of power to both essential and emergency power supplies for the communications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems due to a ground fault in the communications jack box of the ground crew-to-flight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crew communications system in the bay of the nose landing gear or the handset of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public address (PA) system. This condition, if not corrected, could result in the inability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the flight crew to communicate with passengers via the PA system and with air traffic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, which may lead to unsafe operation of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A, Revision 2, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 15, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the power supply for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communications system. This modification (Modification 35288A) entails installing two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diodes on the terminal block and the associated wiring to ensure that, in the event of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical fault in the jack box for the ground crew-to-flight crew communications system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the handset of the PA system, the communications circuits will continue to operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require modification of the power supply for the communications system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts would be provided at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $16,500, or $1,650 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with
Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would require replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units. This proposal is prompted by several incidents in which the flight crew did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depress both halves of the autopilot disconnect switch during the LAND 2 or LAND 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach and, as a result, one autopilot remained engaged. This condition resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unanticipated movements of the stabilizer trim and higher than anticipated control forces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the flight controls. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flight crew from inadvertently disconnecting only one autopilot when both autopilots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are engaged, which could result in unanticipated control surface movements.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Netherlands, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that operators have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported several incidents in which the flight crew did not depress both halves of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
autopilot disconnect switch during the LAND 2 or LAND 3 approach and, as a result, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
autopilot remained engaged. Although certain aural warnings sounded and visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators illuminated in these situations, the flight crew still believed that both autopilots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been disconnected. Consequently, unanticipated movements of the stabilizer trim and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than anticipated control forces of the flight controls occurred. Inadvertent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disconnection of only one autopilot when both autopilots are engaged could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unanticipated control surface movements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;22&hyph;020, dated September 25, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that describes procedures for replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified units. Installation of the modified units will ensure that if one-half of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
autopilot disconnect switch is depressed, both autopilots will disengage; in addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system will remain separated. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive 90&hyph;112(A), dated October 15, 1990, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts would cost approximately $2,500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,860, or $2,940 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action proposes to establish Class D and Class E airspace at Bullhead City, AZ. An airport control tower has been
commissioned at Laughlin/Bullhead Municipal Airport. This proposal would provide adequate Class D airspace for
instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and require two-way communications at Laughlin/Bullhead Municipal Airport,
and would establish Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures in areas outside the Class D surface area.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
D airspace with Class E arrival extensions at Bullhead City, AZ. An airport traffic control tower was commissioned
at Laughlin/Bullhead Municipal Airport. This proposal would provide adequate Class D and E airspace for IFR operations
and require two-way radio communications at Laughlin/Bullhead Municipal Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as extensions to Class D surface areas are published in Paragraph
6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would
be published subsequently in this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, the Commission is proposing a rule to require child-resistant
packaging for mouthwashes with 3 grams or more of absolute ethanol per package. The Commission has preliminarily
determined that child-resistant packaging is necessary to protect children under 5 years of age from serious personal
injury and serious illness resulting from ingesting mouthwash.

1. Relevant Statutes and Regulations

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the ``PPPA''), 15 U.S.C. 1471&hyph;1476, authorizes the Commission
to establish standards for the ``special packaging'' of any household substance if (1) the degree or nature of the
hazard to children in the availability of such substance, by reason of its packaging, is such that special packaging
is required to protect children from serious personal injury or serious illness resulting from handling, using,
or ingesting such substance and (2) the special packaging is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate
for such substance. Special packaging, also referred to as ``child-resistant packaging,'' is defined as packaging
that is (1) designed or constructed to be significantly difficult for children under 5 years of age to open or obtain
a toxic or harmful amount of the substance contained therein within a reasonable time and (2) not difficult for normal
adults to use properly. (It does not mean, however, packaging which all such children cannot open, or obtain a toxic
or harmful amount from, within a reasonable time.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the PPPA, effectiveness standards have been established for special packaging (16 CFR 1700.15), as has a procedure
for evaluating the effectiveness (16 CFR 1700.20). Regulations have been issued requiring special packaging for
a number of household products (16 CFR 1700.14). The findings that the Commission must make in order to issue a standard
requiring child-resistant (``CR'') packaging for a product are discussed below in Section D of this notice. For the
purposes of the PPPA, the amount of a substance ``in a single package'' that triggers the requirement to place the product
in CR packaging refers to the total amount in a single retail unit of the substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PPPA allows the Commission to require CR packaging for household substances, which include foods, drugs, or cosmetics
as these terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321). 15 U.S.C. 1471(2)(B). Mouthwashes
are either drugs, if they make medical claims, or cosmetics.

Section 4(a) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1473(a), allows the manufacturer or packer to package a nonprescription product
subject to special packaging standards in one size of non-CR packaging only if (1) the manufacturer (or packer) also
supplies the substance in CR packages and (2) the non-CR packages bear conspicuous labeling stating: ``This package
for households without young children.'' 15 U.S.C. 1473(a). If the package is too small to accommodate this label
statement, the package may bear a label stating: ``Package not child-resistant.'' 16 CFR 1700.5(b). The right of
the manufacturer or packer to market a single size of the product in noncomplying packaging under these conditions
is termed the ``single-size exemption.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission may restrict the right to market a single size in noncomplying packaging if the Commission finds that
the substance is not also being supplied in popular size packages that comply with the standard. 15 U.S.C. 1473(c).
In this case, the Commission may, after giving the manufacturer or packer an opportunity to comply with the purposes
of the PPPA and an opportunity for a hearing, order that the substance be packaged exclusively in CR packaging. To issue
such an order, the Commission must find that the exclusive use of special packaging is necessary to accomplish the
purposes of the PPPA.

2. The Mouthwash Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 2, 1993, the Commission was petitioned to require child resistant packaging for mouthwashes containing
more than 5 percent ethanol. The term ``mouthwash'' includes liquid products that are variously called mouthwashes,
mouthrinses, antiseptics, gargles, fluoride rinses, anti-plaque rinses, and breath fresheners. It does not include
throat sprays or aerosol breath fresheners. The petition was submitted by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the
American Association of Poison Control Centers, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and 28 states, Guam,
and the Northern Mariana Islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners stated several reasons for their request: (1) Many mouthwashes contain high percentages of ethanol,
an extremely toxic substance, in a package large enough to cause children serious injury or death; (2) these mouthwashes
are accessible to children because they are generally considered innocuous and do not have CR packages; (3) they are
attractive to children because of their appealing taste, color, and smell; and (4) data show that children have been
seriously injured or died from accidental ingestion of ethanol-containing mouthwashes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 17, 1993, the Commission granted the petition. Although the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association
(``NDMA'') and the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association (``CTFA'') had announced plans to implement a
voluntary program to place mouthwashes with more than 5 percent ethanol in CR containers, the Commission found that
mandatory action still may be necessary. In April 1994, the NDMA and CTFA notified the Commission that the products
subject to their voluntary program had been changed from mouthwashes with more than 5 percent ethanol to mouthwashes
with 3 grams or more in a single container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission's toxicity review indicates that mouthwashes with ethanol can present a serious ingestion hazard
to children. Most of the popular adult mouthwashes contain between 14 percent and 27 percent ethanol. By comparison,
beer contains between 5 percent and 7 percent ethanol and wine contains 12 to 14 percent ethanol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethanol depresses the central nervous system. Symptoms of acute ethanol poisoning in children include irritability,
lethargy, and unconsciousness which can lead to coma and death at high doses. Lethal blood levels of ethanol in children
are reported to range between 250 and 500 mg/dl, and the lethal dose of ethanol is 3 g/kg. Deaths or serious injury could
occur at lower doses due to other ethanol-induced effects. Ethanol poisoning in children can produce certain metabolic
complications such as hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypokalemia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the relevant literature shows that three deaths of children under 5 years of age have been reported. The
most recent death reported occurred in 1992 and involved a 3-year-old girl who ingested an unknown amount of mouthwash
that contained 18 percent ethanol. Several other cases of ethanol-induced hypoglycemia or toxicity following mouthwash
ingestion are reported in the literature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (``NEISS'') reported 36 cases of ethanol-containing mouthwash
from January 1987 through November 1993. Based on these ingestions, it was estimated that a total of 1,670 mouthwash
poisoning cases were treated in hospital emergency rooms in the United States during that time. An estimated 81 percent
of these children were 1 or 2 years old, and about 5 percent of the children were hospitalized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition to these sources, the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Data Collection System
(``AAPCC'') includes cases reported by participating poison control centers. The AAPCC received 10,193 reports
of ingestions of ethanol-containing mouthwash by children under 6 years of age during the 5-year period from 1987
through 1991. The AAPCC reported 1,847 ingestions of mouthwash with ethanol by children under 5 years old in 1991.
Of these ingestions, 181 resulted in minor or moderate outcomes (symptoms were not life-threatening) and 1 resulted
in a major, or life-threatening, outcome. Most cases reported to poison control centers are managed in a non-health-care
facility, usually the patient's home.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Proposed Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The mouthwash petition requested that the Commission require CR packaging for mouthwash that contains more than
5 percent ethanol. The Commission decided to propose that mouthwash products with 3 grams (g) or more of absolute ethanol
per package or retail-sale unit should be subject to the regulation. This level is obtained by dividing the lethal
dose of ethanol (3 g/kg of body weight) for a 10-kg child (30 g) by a safety factor of 10. This safety factor is needed because
less than the ``lethal'' dose can produce serious toxic effects, or even death from hypoglycemia or other secondary
effects. Three grams of absolute ethanol are present in approximately 2.6 ounces of mouthwash with 5 percent ethanol.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulating at the level requested by the petitioners (more than 5 percent ethanol) may not sufficiently protect children.
This is because relatively small amounts of mouthwash at a level of 5 percent or somewhat below would exceed the 3 g limit
that the Commission has preliminarily determined is needed to protect children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
D. Statutory Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Hazard to Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As noted above, the toxicity data concerning children's ingestion of ethanol-containing mouthwash demonstrate
that the amount of ethanol in available mouthwash preparations is sufficient to cause serious illness and injury
to children. These mouthwash preparations are readily available to children. Even if the manufacturers of these
mouthwashes that are members of the NDMA and CFTA will voluntarily use CR packaging for their products, the Commission
concludes that a regulation is needed to ensure that products subject to the regulation will be placed in CR packaging
by all mouthwash packagers. In addition, the regulation will enable the Commission to enforce the CR packaging requirement
and ensure that effective CR packaging is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 3(a) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1472(a), the Commission finds preliminarily that the degree and nature
of the hazard to children from ingesting ethanol-containing mouthwashes is such that special packaging is required
to protect children from serious illness. The Commission bases this preliminary finding on the toxic nature of such
mouthwashes, described above, and the accessibility of such preparations to children in the home. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
2. Technical Feasibility, Practicability, and Appropriateness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In issuing a standard for special packaging under the PPPA, the Commission is required by section 3(a)(2) of the PPPA,
15 U.S.C. 1472(a)(2), to find that the special packaging is ``technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate.''
Technical feasibility exists when technology exists or readily can be developed and implemented by the effective
date to produce packaging that conforms to the standards. Practicability means that special packaging complying
with the standards can utilize modern mass production and assembly line techniques. Appropriateness exists when
packaging complying with the standards will adequately protect the integrity of the substance and not interfere
with the intended storage or use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CR packages are mass produced for products that contain ethanol and have similar properties to mouthwashes. Two industry
groups have indicated that their members can have CR packages for one size of their mouthwashes by August 31, 1994,
with their entire lines converted by May 1, 1995. In addition, one major manufacturer of mouthwash has introduced
a popular size of its product in packaging that is not only child resistant, but is easier for adult consumers (and especially
older adults) to open. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily concludes that CR packaging for mouthwashes is technically
feasible, practicable, and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
3. Other Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In establishing a special packaging standard, section 3(b) of the PPPA, 15 U.S.C. 1472(b), requires the Commission
to consider the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The reasonableness of the standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Available scientific, medical, and engineering data concerning special packaging and concerning childhood
accidental ingestions, illness, and injury caused by household substances; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The manufacturing practices of industries affected by the PPPA; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
d. The nature and use of the household substance. 15 U.S.C. 1472(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These items have been considered with respect to the various determinations made in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
E. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The PPPA provides that no regulation shall take effect sooner than 180 days or later than one year from the date such
regulation is issued, except that, for good cause, the Commission may establish an earlier effective date if it determines
an earlier date to be in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. 1471n. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of their voluntary program, members of the NDMA and the CFTA are already implementing assembly line and mass
production techniques to package ethanol-containing mouthwashes with CR packages. These groups have indicated
that their program will be fully implemented by May 1, 1995, and will involve at least 95 percent of the industry's sales.
Furthermore, these groups have indicated that each of their members will have at least one size of product in CR packaging
by August 31, 1994. Thus, it appears that the manufacturers will be phasing in CR packaging over various product sizes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it appears that as the end of the industry's phase-in period approaches, there will be a relatively small
portion of production that would not be in CR packaging. At least one major manufacturer has already started using
CR packaging on what reportedly is a major portion of its production. The Commission concludes that even the few packagers
of mouthwash products containing 3 grams or more of ethanol that are not participating in the voluntary program should
be able to implement CR packaging for their products by 6 months after the issuance of a final rule, or by May 1, 1995,
whichever is sooner, without serious adverse economic effects. Any packagers that did not have their assembly lines
for CR packaging fully operational by that time could obtain appropriate packaging on an interim basis from contract
packers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final rule is proposed to become effective 180 days after issuance of a final rule, or May 1, 1995,
whichever is sooner, as to all products subject to the rule that are packaged on or after that date. It is possible, therefore,
that the effective date will be less than 180 days after issuance of the final rule. The Commission finds that there
is good cause for preliminarily determining that an effective date of less than 180 days is in the public interest.
This determination is based on (1) the desirability of having CR packaging for this product on the market as soon as
practicable in order to reduce the risk of ethanol poisonings to children from a widely distributed product and (2)
the fact that, under the industry's voluntary program, at least 95 percent of the industry will be in compliance by
May 1, 1995.

F. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
When an agency undertakes a rulemaking proceeding, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., generally
requires the agency to prepare proposed and final regulatory flexibility analyses describing the impact of the rule
on small businesses and other small entities. The purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as stated in section
2(b) (5 U.S.C. 602 note), is to require agencies, consistent with their objectives, to fit the requirements of regulations
to the scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to the regulations. Section
605 of the Act provides that an agency is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis if the head of an
agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's Directorate for Economics has prepared a preliminary economic assessment of a rule to require special
packaging for mouthwash preparations with 3 g or more of ethanol in a single package. Based on this assessment, the
Commission concludes that such a requirement would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
businesses or other small entities because of the widespread acceptance of the voluntary CR packaging program. CR
packaging for mouthwash preparations is readily available at an incremental cost of one-half to two cents per closure,
and the PPPA permits manufacturers to market preparations in one non-CR size. The relatively low costs of CR packages
should not be a burden to current small business manufacturers or an entry burden for future marketers. Manufacturers
would be given enough time to use up existing supplies of non-CR packages and to obtain suitable CR packaging and incorporate
its use into their packaging lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, for the reasons given above, the Commission preliminarily concludes that the rule to require special
packaging for mouthwashes containing 3 g or more of ethanol would not have any significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
G. Environmental Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
and CPSC procedures for environmental review, the Commission has assessed the possible environmental effects associated
with the proposed Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) packaging requirements for ethanol-containing products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1021.5(c)(3) state that rules requiring special packaging for consumer products
normally have little or no potential for affecting the human environment. Preliminary analysis of the potential
impact of this proposed rule indicates that CR packages for certain mouthwash preparations would have no significant
effects on the environment. This is because the rule will not significantly increase the number of CR packages in use
and, in any event, the manufacture, use, and potential disposal of the CR packages present the same potential environmental
effects as do the currently used packages.

In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Title 5 U.S.C. App. I), section 3 of the Negotiated Rulemaking
Act of 1990, Title 5 U.S.C. 561 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and after consultation with the General Services Administration (GSA), the Secretary of Labor has determined that
the establishment of the Steel Erection Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee is in the public interest in connection
with the performance of duties imposed on the Department by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 651 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee will function as an integral part of the Department's rulemaking on revising safety standards for steel
erection. It will attempt, via face-to-face negotiations, to reach consensus on the coverage and the substance of
these rules, which can be used as the basis of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The Committee is responsible for identifying
the key issues, gauging their importance, analyzing the information necessary to resolve the issues, arriving at
a consensus, and submitting to the Secretary of Labor the proposed regulatory text and supporting rationale and documentation
for an occupational safety standard governing worker safety during steel erection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings shall be held, as necessary, at the discretion of the Chairperson, however, no fewer than six meetings shall
be held. The Committee will terminate two years from the date of this Charter or until the promulgation of the final
standard, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee is composed of no more than 25 members including a facilitator, appointed by the Secretary of Labor,
unless the Secretary of Labor determines that a greater number of members is necessary for the functioning of the Committee
or to achieve balanced membership. Members may represent the following interests in appropriate balance: Architectural,
design, and engineering firms; developers, property owners and general contractors; erection contractors using
steel; fabricators of structural steel products; insurance organizations and public interest groups; labor organizations
representing employees who perform erection work; manufacturers and suppliers of fall protection safety equipment;
manufacturers and suppliers of structural members and pre-engineered components; and government entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee will report to the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health. It will function solely
as an advisory body and in compliance with the provisions of the FACA and the NRA. Its Charter will be filed under the
FACA fifteen (15) days from the date of this publication.

 This proposed amendment to the cargo preference regulations of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) states that
the requirement for the carriage of preference cargoes on privately-owned ``available'' U.S.-flag commercial
vessels would be satisfied, during a one-season trial period, by U.S.-flag commercial vessels calling at a Canadian
transshipment terminal outside the St. Lawrence Seaway, to load bulk agricultural commodity cargoes subject to
the cargo preference laws that are transshipped from U.S. ports on the Great Lakes by U.S.-flag or foreign-flag vessels;
and determinations of ``fair and reasonable rates for United States commercial vessels'' would include through
bills of lading for such available U.S.-flag commercial vessels. This amendment would allow Great Lakes ports to
compete for agricultural commodity preference cargoes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 United States law requires that at least 50 percent of cargo ``impelled'' by Federal programs (preference cargoes),
and transported by sea, be carried on privately-owned United States-flag commercial vessels, to the extent that
such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates. See sections 901(b) (the ``Cargo Preference Act'') and 901b,
Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (``the Act''), 46 App. U.S.C. 1241(b) and 1241f. The Secretary of Transportation
is desirous of administering that program so that all ports and port ranges may participate. As discussed below, to
achieve these objectives, MARAD is proposing to amend its cargo preference regulations to allow Great Lakes ports
to compete for agricultural commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preference cargoes for a one-season trial period, corresponding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Great Lakes shipping season when the St. Lawrence Seaway system is in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a number of reasons, United States-flag commercial vessels in foreign commerce do not serve the Great Lakes. Consequently,
cargoes subject to cargo preference are not loaded at Great Lakes ports, resulting in significantly less cargo for
these ports in comparison with ports on other United States coasts. MARAD proposes to permit cargoes to be counted
toward the preference requirements if they are loaded at Great Lakes ports for the trip along the St. Lawrence Seaway
and then transferred to United States-flag vessels for the ocean portion of their carriage. The registry (``flag'')
of the vessel loading the cargo on the Great Lakes and carrying it through the Seaway would not be relevant. This rule
would be in effect during a trial period corresponding to the current Great Lakes shipping season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MARAD has issued a regulation governing compliance with cargo preference requirements by shipper agencies, which
is published at 46 CFR 381.8. This proposed rule would add a new section 381.9 to MARAD's cargo preference regulations.
It would state that: (1) For a one-season trial period, the requirement for ``available'' U.S.-flag commercial vessels
under the Act would be satisfied by U.S.-flag commercial vessels calling at a Canadian transshipment terminal outside
the St. Lawrence Seaway to carry bulk agricultural commodity cargoes subject to the cargo preference laws, transshipped
from U.S. ports on the Great Lakes by U.S.-flag or foreign-flag vessels; and (2) determinations of ``fair and reasonable
rates for United States commercial vessels'' under section 901(b) would include through bills of lading for such
available U.S.-flag vessels. Such combination foreign/U.S.-flag voyages would not be allowed if, in the future,
all-U.S.-flag carriage, at fair and reasonable rates for U.S.-flag commercial vessel service, becomes available
to load bulk agricultural commodities at U.S. Great Lakes ports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on experience during the trial period, and after reviewing comments on this rulemaking, MARAD will consider
whether to make this rule permanent, or extend it for a period of time longer than the one-season trial period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for this rulemaking arises due to changing shipping conditions affecting U.S.-flag vessels operating in
the Great Lakes, resulting in the absence of all-U.S.-flag vessel availability for the carriage of cargo between
U.S. Great Lakes ports and foreign countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that this proposal is precluded by any rulings of the Comptroller General. Specifically, in 1960,
the Comptroller General examined a practice involving shipment of preference cargoes from U.S. Great Lakes ports
to Canadian St. Lawrence River ports on foreign-flag vessels for ``topping off'' U.S.-flag ocean-going vessels
which had partially loaded at U.S. Great Lakes ports. No. B&hyph;140872, 39 Comp. Gen. 758 (1960). The Comptroller
General's opinion found no basis to criticize a regulation of the Department of Agriculture holding that 50 percent
of the cargo

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 moving between the U.S. Great Lakes ports and Canadian St. Lawrence River ports must move on U.S.-flag vessels. It
should be noted that at that time there was some all-U.S.-flag service to U.S. Great Lakes ports.

The Comptroller General's 1960 decision predated the 75 percent requirement instituted by the Food Security Act
of 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dramatic changes in shipping conditions have occurred since 1960, including the disappearance of any all-U.S.-flag
commercial ocean-going service to foreign countries from U.S. Great Lakes ports. The static configuration of the
St. Lawrence Seaway system and the evolving greater size of commercial vessels is one significant shipping change.
In 1960, the average U.S.-flag general cargo vessel had a deadweight tonnage of 10,976; while in 1993, the average
U.S.-flag general cargo vessel had a deadweight tonnage of 17,464.

increased greatly during the past ten years.

270,359 metric tons, or 27 percent. However, little preference cargo has moved on U.S.-flag vessels out of the Great
Lakes since 1989, with the exception of the MORMACSKY trial in 1993, discussed below. At present, the Great Lakes simply
do not have any all-U.S.-flag ocean freight capability for carriage of bulk preference cargo. In contrast, the total
non-liner export nationwide of USDA and AID agricultural assistance program cargo subject to cargo preference in
the 1992&hyph;3 cargo preference year (the latest program year for which figures are available) amounted to 6,297,015
metric tons, of which 4,923,244 mt. or 78.2 percent was transported on U.S.-flag vessels. (Source: Maritime Administration
data base.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disappearance of government-impelled cargo flowing from the Great Lakes coincides with the expiration of the
Great Lakes ``set aside.'' Under the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, codified at 46 App. U.S.C.
1241f(c)(2), a certain minimum amount of government-impelled cargo was required to be allocated to Great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lakes ports during calendar years 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989. That ``set-aside'' expired in 1989, and was not renewed
by the Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 results reflect a unique movement out of the Great Lakes involving a U.S.-flag mother ship and two U.S.-flag
feeder vessels. Two U.S.-flag lake bulk carriers, the J. L. MAUTHE and the AMERICAN MARINER, served as feeders bringing
wheat from a U.S. Great Lakes port to a Canadian transshipment point where the MORMACSKY, a U.S.-flag ocean going vessel,
loaded the cargo destined to Russia. All the vessels were under the control of U.S.-flag carriers. Reportedly, the
demonstration was possible as a result of commodity prices in the Midwest which favored the Great Lakes over other
U.S. ports. However, the MORMACSKY experiment has not been duplicated. The high cost of U.S.-flag feeder carriage
involved in such transshipment would normally allow future transshipment only if foreign-flag vessels brought
the cargo to the Canadian transshipment point and resulted in the lowest landed cost.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This rule would not establish a preference or set aside for the Great Lakes. Availability of U.S.-flag service would
continue to be determined on a national basis. The amount of cargo reserved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for U.S.-flag vessels overall would not decrease because the cargo to be moved on foreign-flag feeder vessels to Canadian
transshipment points would not be ``subtracted out'' from the 75 percent of cargoes reserved for U.S.-flag carriage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule recognizes the operational limitations of the St. Lawrence Seaway and makes it possible for U.S.
ports situated on the Great Lakes to compete with ports located on the other coastal ranges of the United States for
the shipment of bulk agricultural product cargoes. It would not guarantee that cargoes will move through Great Lakes
ports, but would only allow the Great Lakes ports an opportunity to compete for such cargoes. Movements out of the Great
Lakes would still be required to be cost competitive with U.S.-flag service from the other coastal ranges in order
to attract cargoes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would not interfere with the concept of ``lowest landed cost'' contained in the regulations of
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a unit of the Department of Agriculture responsible for obtaining agricultural
products for shipment under various foreign aid programs. The CCC regulations, at 7 CFR 1496.5, provide that the lowest
combined total cost of the commodity, plus transportation charges to the port of destination calculated on the basis
of U.S.-flag rates and availability, will prevail with regard to awarding contracts. The proposed combined transportation
originating at Great Lakes ports would compete on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of lowest landed cost with U.S.-flag vessel availability from the other port ranges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for determining a ``fair and reasonable'' rate for this mixed carriage, the U.S.-flag component would be considered
under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulations at 46 CFR part 382 or part 383, as appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the cost for the foreign-flag component incorporated into the U.S.-flag component in the same way as the cost
of foreign-flag vessels used in lightening operations in the recipient country's territorial waters.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). It is not considered to be an economically significant regulatory
action under section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, since it has been determined that it is not likely to result in a rule that may
have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities. Since this rule would affect other Federal agencies, is of great interest to the maritime
industry, and has been determined to be a significant rule under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures,
it is considered to be a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. The abbreviated time for comment on the one-season
trial period is necessitated by the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway System on April 5, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MARAD projects that this rule would allow the movement of up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250,000 to 300,000 metric tons of agricultural commodities from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great Lakes ports, with a reduction in the shipping cost to the sponsoring Federal agencies of up to $2 to $3 per metric
ton ($500,000 to $900,000).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of shipping bulk agricultural commodities from U.S. Great Lakes ports during the 1994 shipping season,
if direct U.S.-flag service, at fair and reasonable rates, is not available at U.S. ports in the Great Lakes, a joint
service involving a foreign-flag vessel(s) carrying cargo no farther than a Canadian port(s) on the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
with transshipment via a U.S.-flag privately owned commercial vessel to the ultimate destination, will be deemed
to comply with the requirement of ``available'' commercial U.S.-flag service under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954.
Shipper agencies considering bids resulting in the lowest landed cost of transportation based on U.S.-flag rates
and service shall include within the comparison of U.S.-flag rates and service, for shipments originating in U.S.
Great Lakes ports, through rates incorporating a foreign-flag leg from U.S. Great Lakes ports to a Canadian port on
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and a U.S.-flag leg for the remainder of the voyage. The ``fair and reasonable'' rate for this
mixed service will be determined by considering the U.S.-flag component under the existing regula- tions at 46 CFR
part 382 or 383, as appropriate, and incorporating the cost for the foreign-flag component into the U.S.-flag ``fair
and reasonable'' rate in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag vessels used to lighten U.S.-flag vessels in the recipient
country's territorial waters.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) proposes to amend the regulations for the Child Care and Development
Block Grant (CCDBG), child care serving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) families, the Transitional
Child Care program (TCC), and At-Risk Child Care program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposal is to support States, Territories and Tribes in their efforts to increase the availability
and quality of federally-subsidized child care, develop more coordinated delivery systems, and improve child care
opportunities for families, providers and communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is presented in a single package because of our intent to remove regulatory barriers to program coordination,
to increase flexibility across the four programs, and to promote common goals. The proposed rule addresses certain
key areas of mutual concern for operation of these programs: Accessibility to higher quality care through amended
payment rates; adaptation of payment policies for children with special needs as a result of the Americans with Disabilities
Act; impact of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other Federal and State statutes on in-home care; and deletion of provisions,
known as the effects test, which may be construed as minimizing regulatory protection for children in care concerning
State implementation of health and safety standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to the CCDBG regulations additionally include technical amendments required by the Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992 and the Older Americans Act Technical Amendments. Other proposals
respond to general concerns about payment differentials for quality care, children's immunizations, eligibility
of children in foster care, availability of certificates as a payment mechanism, and cost limitations for administration
and certain other activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to the regulations for child care for AFDC families, TCC, and At-Risk Child Care promote coordination
among these programs and also with CCDBG to: provide State flexibility in determining a child's physical or mental
incapacity; modify and codify policy regarding child care during gaps in employment; require States to define how
child care is reasonably related to the parent's work or other activity; and allow States flexibility to conform family
fee requirements. Additionally, proposed amendments to TCC would give States the option to provide TCC to families
who voluntarily terminate their AFDC benefit, and address the process of requesting TCC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) administers a number of programs that address the child care needs
of low-income families. In recent years, the scope of ACF-administered child care programs was broadened to address
the child care needs of increasingly larger segments of the population. ACF's child care programs reflect a growing
awareness of the needs of the family for safe child care that also attends to the developmental needs of children. They
offer the Nation's low income families an important support in their efforts to achieve and maintain economic independence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Child care needs for working families who receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits were first
addressed through the dependent care disregard. The family's child care expense (up to $200 a month for a child under
age 2 and up to $175 for a child who is at least age 2) is deducted from the family's earnings when determining the amount
of the family's countable income for the purpose of the family's eligibility for and amount of AFDC assistance. The
dependent care disregard is used by most States as one method for providing child care to working AFDC families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Social Services Block Grant (title XX of the Social Security Act) enables States to provide social services which
are best suited to the needs of its residents. These services can include child care, and most States have used title
XX funds to provide child care through contracts with providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory changes proposed in this rule concern four child care programs created through two statutes: the Family
Support Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;485) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90). A brief description
of each program and of the overall goals of this proposed rule follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Family Support Act of 1988 amended title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act at section 402(g), providing a very
significant extension of ACF's ability to fund child care services. The amendment created two new child care programs.
First, it guaranteed necessary child care for working AFDC recipients, and for AFDC recipients in approved education
or training activities (including the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) Program). This program
is often called AFDC child care. The regulations for AFDC child care are located at 45 CFR part 255. An amendment concerning
applicable child care standards under 45 CFR 255.4 (Allowable Costs and Matching Rates) became effective on August
4, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Family Support Act addressed the need for Transitional Child Care (TCC) during the 12 months after a family
becomes ineligible for AFDC due to work. The regulations specific to TCC are located at 45 CFR part 256. However, many
of the regulations for AFDC child care (part 255) also apply to TCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With OBRA 90, Congress established two additional child care programs that further extended child care services
to the Nation's low-income families: an optional At-Risk Child Care program (child care for low-income working families
in need of such care and otherwise at risk of becoming eligible for AFDC) and the Child Care and Development Block Grant
(CCDBG). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 49 States and the District of Columbia have approval to operate the At-Risk program. That program, like
the other title IV&hyph;A child care programs, requires the State to match Federal funds, but, unlike the other programs,
it is capped and the funds are distributed according to a formula. The At-Risk Child Care program is located at section
402(i) of title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act. The At-Risk regulations are located at 45 CFR part 257. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this preamble, we refer to AFDC child care, TCC, and At-Risk Child Care as the title IV&hyph;A programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CCDBG is intended to provide child care services for low-income families and to increase the availability, affordability,
and quality of child care and development services. That program does not require a State match. Regulations for the
CCDBG program are located at 45 CFR parts 98 and 99. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;586, made various technical
changes to the CCDBG. For example, section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the amendments made changes to section 658J(c) of the
Block Grant Act by replacing ``obligation period'' with ``expenditure period.'' Other minor technical corrections
to the Block Grant Act are included in the Older Americans Act Technical Amendments, Public Law 103&hyph;171.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule incorporates lessons ACF has learned from our initial experience with the title IV-A and CCDBG
programs. Our purpose is to remove barriers, promote coordination, foster higher quality care, and champion the
health of our neediest children. We have evaluated State and Tribal child care program plans, conducted many child
care program field reviews, sponsored two national child care conferences, held symposia for States and Tribes,
and participated in many other conferences and meetings. We have listened as State representatives and others voiced
desire for remedies of regulatory barriers to the operation of seamless child care delivery systems and for the ability
to deliver higher quality care. This section of the preamble gives an overview of our findings and considerations.
These ideas for change are developed in greater detail later in the preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are four main purposes of this proposed rule. First, it is a vehicle for responding to changes needed to existing
regulations to achieve consistency with recently enacted law. We thus propose changes to the CCDBG regulations required
by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992 and the Older Americans Act Technical Amendments.
We also propose amendments and provide guidance in the preamble on how payments for special needs children can be made
under both title IV-A child care and CCDBG in light of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Public Law 101&hyph;336,
enacted on July 26, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, these proposals reflect ACF's desire to help States facilitate operation of the title IV-A and CCDBG programs
based on the experiences of both States and families with existing program policy. The changes will give States some
immediate relief to certain regulatory barriers. Many of these proposals will permit States to coordinate the four
programs better, making services more seamless for child care providers and families. Allowing for greater conformity
among the sliding fee scales for title IV-A child care and CCDBG is an example of this kind of effort. Allowing States
to determine physical or mental incapacity of children to be served under title IV-A consistent with CCDBG rules is
another example. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, our objective in proposing these changes is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthen States' capacity to ensure the quality of federally-subsidized child care services by removing regulatory
barriers. We believe the quality of federally-subsidized child care is important and want to promote safe and healthy
environments for children that foster their development and overall well-being. We wish to further foster quality
in partnership with the States. Our proposals to foster quality include eliminating the regulation in the CCDBG that
limits payment differentials within categories of care to no more than 10 percent. We also propose to allow States
to pay the actual charge for higher quality child care for children in title IV-A programs, without regard to the 75th
percentile of the local cost of care, for child care that meets State-designated objective standards of quality that
exceed the normal licensing or certification requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the health of children plays an overwhelmingly important role in their well-being and their ability to grow
and develop into productive citizens. We therefore propose to amend the CCDBG health and safety standards to require
that children receiving CCDBG services receive immunizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, this proposed rule goes beyond adoption of technical refinements to ACF-administered child care programs.
It represents ACF's efforts to think more broadly about helping States better serve low-income families through
subsidized child care.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations for the title IV-A child care programs are published under the general authority of 1102 of the Social
Security Act which requires the Secretary to publish regulations that may be necessary for the efficient administration
of the functions for which she is responsible under the Act. Section 658E of the Child Care and Development Block Grant
Act requires that the Secretary shall by rule establish the information needed in the Block Grant plan.

Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was difficult for us to determine the actual cost implications of the regulation because most of the changes are
optional with States. We did not know how many States would adopt these options, or whether States would make other
programmatic changes which would counteract any potential increases in costs. Therefore, we are explicitly seeking
comments on the cost implications of the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing a new requirement that children be immunized in order to receive services under the Child Care and
Development Block Grant. The CCDBG health and safety regulations currently require States and Tribes to include
provisions about immunizations in their CCDBG plans and to provide assurances that requirements with respect to
immunizations are in place. In addition, most States already include immunizations in their child care standards.
We do not anticipate that our proposal will have a significant negative impact on either grantees or families, since
grantees will not be required to provide immunizations directly and families who receive subsidized child care are
by law eligible for free immunizations under such federally supported programs as Medicaid, the Early Periodic Screening
Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) Program, and the new Vaccines for Children program. The immunization provision
was considered the most cost-effective and least burdensome approach because: (1) It helps ensure that vulnerable
young children are immunized; (2) immunization of such children is highly cost-effective; and (3) it provides flexibility
to grantees in determining how to implement the provision.

Furthermore, it directly supports the President's national immunization initiative, Vaccines for Children, which
calls for greater mobilization and expansion of immunization resources to protect the health of our youngest and
most vulnerable children.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small businesses and other small entities. The primary impact of these
final rules is on State, Tribal and Territorial governments. To a lesser extent the regulation could affect individuals
and small businesses. However, the number of small businesses affected should be limited, and the expected economic
impact on these businesses would not be so significant that a full regulatory flexibility analysis is indicated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;First, the regulations retain many provisions designed to ensure broad participation by small businesses
in the program. For example, the IV&hyph;A entitlement programs provide that individuals must be able to choose among
available providers, including family day care providers. The At-Risk program regulations still require that any
registration requirements States impose on unlicensed and unregulated providers be simple and timely, and facilitate
prompt payment. In the CCDBG program, the regulations still require that parents have a choice among a variety of providers
including family day care providers. These and other provisions in the current rules will help ensure that States
exercise restraint in imposing any additional requirements on small entities providing child care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The proposed rule contains a number of provisions which could result in some decreases in the regulatory and
economic burdens on providers who are small businesses. Most importantly, because States will be able to operate
their programs under a more consistent set of program rules, participating providers should face a simpler and more
streamlined set of regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Many of the providers who would potentially be affected are in-home providers. These providers are generally
not operating as small businesses, but as domestic employees; thus, any impact on them need not be specifically addressed
under this Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulation could ultimately result in some additional regulatory requirements or health and safety standards
for other providers, such as family day care providers, who are small businesses. However, the impacts on small businesses,
if any, would not be directly attributable to this regulation. With the possible exception of the immunization provision,
the regulation does not directly propose any expansion of regulatory requirements or health and safety standards
on providers; thus, any impacts on providers should only arise as the result of independent State and/or local decisions
to impose additional requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects tests may have discouraged States from imposing additional requirements_beyond those which were generally
applicable_on providers who specifically wanted to participate in these federally supported child care programs.
However, we do not believe States have much interest in imposing additional requirements on these providers. First,
States and localities know that parents often have difficulty locating child care providers which meet their needs,
and that low-income parents frequently have more serious access problems. They do not want to make it appreciably
more difficult for providers to participate in the programs which serve low-income families. Secondly, States have
limited resources for enforcing and monitoring child care regulations; thus, they are motivated to be selective
about imposing requirements. Thirdly, States have an interest in establishing a consistent set of requirements
for providers, regardless of their payment sources; differential rules make it more difficult to ensure regulatory
compliance and provide a seamless system of services which help families make the transition from welfare to self-sufficiency.
Finally, under current rules, State and local governments have full flexibility to set general regulatory requirements
and health and safety standards for child care providers. If States (or other grantees) have felt that there was a substantial
need for additional requirements (presumably to protect the well-being of children in care), we would have expected
them to act under this general authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While States generally have immunization requirements for children in child care, the proposed immunization provision
might result in some additional children being subject to immunization requirements or stronger requirements for
some children. However, States have flexibility in deciding how immunization requirements are to be implemented.
Requirements would not necessarily be imposed on providers; rather, States can choose to impose them on eligible
families. Thus, the immunization provision in this proposed rule does not directly affect small businesses. Further,
where States do choose to impose additional requirements on providers related to the immunization provision, such
requirements would be basically administrative in nature (e.g., documentation); we expect the costs of immunization
to be covered through other funding sources. Thus, this provision would not have a significant economic impact on
affected providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the number of entities affected, and the net economic impact on them, should not be significant.

Specifically, State plans would be required to include: (1) Policies on ``reasonably related'' (see &sect;255.1(e)(4)
and &sect;257.21(a)(6)); (2) definitions of ``mentally or physically incapable'' (see &sect;&sect;255.1(m)
and 256.1(a)(5)); and (3) decisions on whether States have opted to provide TCC without formal requests, during gaps,
and in voluntary closure situations (&sect;256.1(a)(6)). If States take advantage of the other new options available
to them, they would also have to report on their criteria for determining ``higher quality'' care (&sect;255.1(i)(2))
and conditions and limitations for in-home care (&sect;255.1(n) and &sect;257.21(o)). The proposed rule would
reduce reporting burden at &sect;255.1(i) through its elimination of the requirement for surveys of special needs
rates.

These amendments to the IV&hyph;A State plans are being submitted to OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the proposed revisions for the CCDBG program will produce minor changes and additions in the CCDBG plan.
Grantee plans will have to include additional information about immunization policies pursuant to the amendments
at &sect;98.41(a)(1) (see &sect;98.16(a)(10)). Depending on their response to the proposed amendments and clarifications,
Grantees may also be revising plan sections on in-home policies (&sect;98.16(a)(7)(ii)), the definition of protective
services (&sect;98.16(a)(6)(vii)), and payment rate differentials (&sect;&sect;98.16(a)(12) and 98.43(e)).

The preamble begins with a discussion of four areas where the proposed regulations for the title IV&hyph;A child care
programs and CCDBG address similar issues_payments for higher quality child care, payments for children with special
needs, providing in-home care, and the effects test. We first discuss these four issues from a common perspective.
But, where needed because the respective statutes for the programs differ, the general discussion on these topics
is followed by a discussion of the proposed regulatory change in the context of the specific program, either the Block
Grant or the applicable title IV&hyph;A program(s). It is our intent that where these proposals address a common issue,
the proposed changes result in policies that better enable States to coordinate these programs into a more cohesive
child care system. Comments which identify the potential for conflicting policy between programs as a result of these
proposals are especially encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the discussion of these four issues, we discuss additional changes specific to the CCDBG (part 98) followed
by proposed changes specific to the title IV&hyph;A child care programs (parts 255, 256, and 257). The proposed regulations
follow the order of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and are presented after the preamble, beginning with the
CCDBG followed by the title IV&hyph;A child care programs.

Payments for Higher Quality Child Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Both the Federal government and the States have an interest in assuring that the increasing number of the Nation's
children who receive child care services benefit from high quality care. This interest applies to all children, whether
or not in subsidized care. High quality care provides parents a necessary support service to enable them to participate
in work, education, or training. High quality care also provides sound developmental support for the children who
comprise our future work force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Balancing the Federal government's interest in an adequate supply of child care to meet the needs of family self-sufficiency
programs with the States' responsibility for regulating the quality of that care is a delicate exercise. We have learned
from administering the title IV&hyph;A and CCDBG programs that States wish to have more opportunities to recognize
higher quality care by compensating providers appropriately. As a result, ACF proposes to amend the payment regulations
for both title IV&hyph;A and CCDBG child care programs. Along with other amendments described in this proposed rule,
these payment amendments will enable States to provide recipients of child care under these programs greater access
to higher quality care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described more fully below, we propose to eliminate the regulation for the CCDBG that limits payment differentials
within categories of care to no more than 10 percent. We also propose to amend the title IV&hyph;A child care regulations
to allow States to pay the actual cost of care, subject only to the statewide limit, for care that meets the State's definition
of higher quality care.

Payments Under CCDBG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We propose to revise &sect;&sect;98.16(a)(12)(ii) and 98.43(e) to remove the 10 percent cap on payment differentials
within a category of care. In addition, we propose to revise &sect;98.43(b) (1) and (2) to clarify that the cost of subsidized
child care services must be no more than the actual amount billed or charged for non-subsidized care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Block Grant Act requires that payment rates take into account the variations in cost of providing child care in
different categories, as defined in &sect;98.2(h), and to children of different age groups, as well as the additional
costs of providing child care for children with special needs. Grantees have been required to differentiate among
center-based, group home, family, and in-home child care providers. The existing regulations permit grantees to
differentiate payment rates within categories of care, if certain conditions are met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As noted in the preamble to the existing regulations, the limit on payment rate differentials within a category of
care was one of the more controversial issues of the regulation. That controversy continues today. In writing the
existing regulations, we were persuaded by grantees and child care advocates that grantees should be permitted to
differentiate within categories of care to account for licensing status and considerations of quality, as well as
coordination with other child care programs. As a consequence, grantees were permitted to set differential payment
rates, with a 10 percent cap, within categories of care. However, in the preamble, we indicated that we would consider
amending the regulation if it became apparent that the 10 percent limit was inappropriate or served no useful purpose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the existing regulations, we have conducted program reviews in States and non-exempt Tribes,
held a number of meetings attended by States, Territories and Tribes, consulted with many child care advocacy groups
and received numerous letters from the Congress and other interested parties. In these contacts, we were told that
child care providers meet varying licensing requirements and provide care at varying levels of quality. Grantees
have asked for the additional flexibility to set payment rates which provide incentives for becoming licensed and
which reflect differences in program quality. A number of grantees have stated that, in setting payment differentials
within categories of care, they want to recognize and compensate those child care facilities which have obtained
nationally recognized accreditation along with those child care providers who have earned Child Development Associates
(CDA) credentials. Additionally, grantees want to take into consideration the differing costs of providing care
in licensed, unlicensed, and license-exempt (e.g., relative) settings, and of providing care during non-traditional
hours (e.g., evenings and nights). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has also been pointed out that other child care subsidy programs allow grantees to differentiate within categories
of care without imposing any limitation on the amount of the payment differential. As a consequence, some grantees
have experienced difficulty in creating a seamless child care system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminating the 10 percent limitation will give grantees the flexibility to address these areas of concern. As a consequence,
we propose to remove the reference to limits on payment differentials in &sect;&sect;98.16(a)(12) and 98.43(e).
We propose to revise &sect;98.43(e) and add &sect;98.16(a)(12)(iii) to require grantees that provide for variations
in the payment rate within a category to include a description of how the differential rates within categories of care
are determined and to identify the distinctions within categories. Grantees would still be required to ensure that
payment rates are sufficient to provide access to child care services comparable to those in the non-subsidized sector.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are clarifying the regulations at &sect;98.43(b) (1) and (2) to read ``amount charged'' instead of costs. We believe
this terminology more clearly reflects Federal policy which prohibit the use of Federal dollars to pay more for a service
than the provider would charge a non-subsidized family. Oftentimes, the provider may not bill the actual costs, believing
that the parent(s) could not afford them. However, providers may well provide those ``costs'' when responding to
market surveys or other ``payment rate'' questions concerning costs, resulting in receipt of payments which exceed
those actually charged. We believe that this revision will eliminate such occurrences. This clarification does
not represent a change in policy.

Payments for Higher Quality Care Under Title IV&hyph;A Child Care Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Currently, Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for title IV&hyph;A child care is available for the lowest of the
actual charge for care, the local market rate for that category of care or the applicable statewide limit. The local
market rate is based on the 75th percentile cost of care in the local area. We continue to believe that the 75th percentile
is a reasonable definition of local market rate. This level represents a balance between concerns about fiscal accountability
and accessibility to most services. In addition, we believe that requiring local market rates to be set at the 75th
percentile has raised the general level of reimbursement to providers. We recognize, however, that the 75th percentile
may not be sufficient to purchase some higher quality care. Therefore, to permit States to recognize and reward higher
quality care, we propose amending &sect;255.4(a) to define the actual charge for care that meets the State's objective
criteria for higher quality care as the local market rate for such care. We will provide FFP for the actual charge for
such care, subject to the statewide limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we recognize that State licensing or regulatory certification contributes to high quality care, we do not believe
that licensing or regulation is the sole criterion or indicator of a higher quality of care. The proposed amendment
to &sect;255.4(a) requires that the State-defined higher quality criteria will be in addition to existing State
licensing or regulatory requirements. For example, the State's objective criteria for higher quality care might
be that providers have a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential coupled with lower than regulatory staff/child
ratios, or the State could choose the Head Start Program Performance Standards or other nationally or State-recognized
criteria as its criteria for higher quality. We do not propose a national standard or definition for higher quality
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, it is not the intention that this regulation be used to circumvent the regulation at &sect;255.4(a)(2)(iii)
which establishes local market rates at the 75th percentile based on a survey of providers in an area. We expect that,
because the State's criteria for higher quality care will be above the licensing and regulatory standards generally
in effect, the State will make payments at the actual cost (subject only to the statewide limit) under this provision
less frequently than payments are made at the 75th percentile. Payments for higher quality care would apply, then,
to only a few providers in an area, not the majority of providers. These providers still would be included in local market
rate surveys. We are also proposing to amend &sect;255.1(i) to require States to specify in the Supportive Services
Plan their objective criteria for higher quality care.

To be consistent in our terminology, we propose to amend &sect;255.4(a)(2)(iii) to replace ``type'' with ``category''

Payments for Child Care for Children With Special Needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For the purposes of this section only, in discussing payments for child care, we use the term ``special needs'' to mean
children with mental or physical impairments that substantially limit one or more of the major life activities, i.e.,
``disabilities'' as the term is used in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Special needs in this preamble
discussion does not mean foster care, protective services, bilingual/cultural needs or other broader considerations
sometimes attached to the term, for example, for the purpose of targeting as required by the CCDBG regulations at &sect;98.44(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Americans With Disabilities Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Americans with Disabilities Act, enacted on July 26, 1990, provides comprehensive civil rights protections
to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government
services, and telecommunications. The ADA is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). However, most
States have established a central contact, usually in the office of the Governor or Attorney General, and questions
about the ADA should be referred to that contact first. In addition, DOJ has established a technical assistance Information
Line for public inquiries. The Information Line is available 24 hours daily at (202) 514&hyph;0301 (voice) or (202)
514&hyph;0381 (TDD). (This number will be replaced with a toll free 800 number in the future.) Lastly, written inquiries
about the ADA may be directed to: U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Public Access Section, P.O. Box
66738, Washington, DC 20035&hyph;6738. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of particular consequence in the context of paying for child care is title III of the ADA which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of disability by private entities in places of public accommodation. The ADA defined public accommodations
as facilities whose operations affect commerce and fall within twelve specified categories, including social service
center establishments. The implementing regulations for the ADA, issued on July 26, 1991, specifically include
``day care centers'' as public accommodations and clarified that places of public accommodation located in a private
residence are covered by the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ADA uses the term ``day care center'' as a generic term for all categories of out-of-home child care providers.
In contrast to many other Federal non-discrimination laws, a public accommodation does not have to receive Federal
funding to be covered by the requirements of the ADA. Thus, with a few very limited exceptions specified in the ADA,
all child care providers who provide services to the public are covered by the ADA. While most provisions of the ADA
have been well understood, there has been considerable confusion about its impact on payments for child care, particularly
when such payment is subsidized. In light of the ADA, we believe it is important to discuss the payments for child care
for children with special needs under ACF-administered child care programs. We are therefore proposing clarifications
to the regulations which address payments for child care for children with special needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ADA regulation at 28 CFR 36.301(c) states: ``A public accommodation may not impose a surcharge on a particular
individual with a disability *&blank;*&blank;* to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary
aids, barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable modification in policies, practices or
procedures, that are required to provide that individual *&blank;*&blank;* with the non-discriminatory treatment
required by the Act *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to ``whether day care centers may charge for extra services provided to individuals with disabilities,''
the preamble noted that &sect;36.301(c) ``is intended only to prohibit charges for measures necessary to achieve
compliance with the ADA.'' (56 FR 35564, July 26, 1991.) Thus, the ADA and its implementing regulations do allow caregivers
to charge higher rates for special needs, provided those higher charges are for services beyond those required by
the ADA and are not for the purpose of recouping the cost of measures required by the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States need the flexibility to determine on an individual basis how best to meet the needs of children with special
needs. It is our intent that such children receive quality child care in developmentally appropriate settings so
that they may reach their maximum potential and grow into responsive and responsible adults. Providers should be
compensated, within the ADA regulations, for those developmentally appropriate child care services provided to
children with special needs in order to ensure that these children do not go unserved and the quality of care is not affected.
(At the same time, such compensation must be consistent with the cost principles applicable to expenditures under
the program.)

Payments for Child Care for Children With Special Needs Under CCDBG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The CCDBG program uses the term ``special needs'' in two different contexts. But as stated earlier for the purpose
of payment rate discussion, the term ``children with special needs'' will be used to refer to children with mental
or physical impairments that substantially limit one or more of the major life activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the ADA stresses the need for making decisions on accommodations on an individual basis, it is inconsistent
to require grantees to set a single or overall payment rate for children with special needs. We believe that grantees
must have the flexibility to set payment amounts on a case-by-case basis. As a consequence, we propose to revise &sect;98.16(a)(12)(ii)
by removing the requirement that grantees justify a decision not to have different rates based on the additional amount
charged for child care services provided to a child with special needs. We also propose revising &sect;98.43(b)(2)
to reflect that additional charges for providing child care for a child with special needs must be for services not
required as an accommodation under the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Payments for Child Care for Children With Special Needs Under Title IV&hyph;A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing regulations governing payments for title IV&hyph;A child care require States to conduct local market
surveys to establish rates for such care, including care for children with special needs, where applicable. Further,
although the regulations for the CCDBG do not require that grantees conduct such market surveys, many grantees have
adopted the title IV&hyph;A local market rates established by these surveys. The ADA does not explicitly prevent
States and grantees from continuing to conduct and use such surveys as a method of establishing rates for payment of
special needs child care. However, given the emphasis of the ADA on accommodating persons with disabilities on an
individualized basis, ACF strongly believes that local market surveys, for the purpose of establishing rates for
special needs care, are no longer useful or accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the ADA stresses that decisions on accommodations for a person's disability must be made on an individual,
case-by-case basis, we propose at &sect;255.4(a)(2) that in lieu of a local market survey to establish rates for special
needs care, States must use the following method for determining payments to providers of care to special needs children:
when a provider charges a special needs child, on an individual basis, a rate that exceeds the local market rate for
a child of the same age and category of care, that charge would be the local market rate for that special needs child.
The State would pay that charge, subject to the statewide limit and applicable cost principles, if it is for services
which are not required as an accommodation under the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other than the statewide limit, our regulations do not provide for or authorize additional limitations on charges
for children whose needs go beyond those accommodated under ADA. We had concerns that such limitations could violate
the ADA principle of individual accommodation, and we did not want to entangle welfare agencies in decisions about
what are appropriate accommodations under ADA. Further, it is our belief that the general cost principles applicable
in these programs protect both Federal and State governments against provider charges that are unreasonable. Nevertheless,
we are interested in comments in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that States may continue to establish higher statewide limits for children with special needs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, we believe that States cannot establish valid local market rates for children with special needs
because, under the ADA, any higher charges must be based on the individual child's and provider's circumstances;
these would not be known or taken into account by a survey. Accordingly, we also propose to remove the reference to differentiating
local market rates for children with special needs from &sect;255.4(a)(3)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
In-Home Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The CCDBG and title IV&hyph;A child care regulations currently mandate that States and other grantees offer in-home
care as an option to parents whose child care is subsidized by these programs. However, the provisions for in-home
care in the two sets of regulations lack compatibility and impede seamless program administration. CCDBG grantees
are allowed to limit the availability of in-home care to those situations in which the payment is reasonably similar
to payments for other categories of care. The title IV&hyph;A regulations contain no such provision for limiting
the availability of in-home care and, unlike the CCDBG, require that States establish local market rates for this
category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To increase the compatibility between CCDBG and IV&hyph;A regulations we are proposing to: (1) Allow States and other
grantees the same degree of flexibility under both programs; (2) give both programs greater latitude in setting the
terms and conditions under which in-home care will be offered; and (3) allow States to establish the minimum wage as
the in-home payment rate for care subsidized under title IV&hyph;A without conducting a market survey. We believe
that these proposals will give States and other grantees greater control and flexibility over the use of in-home care
while protecting parental choice and ensuring that specific family needs can be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this category of care occurs in the child's own home, it has unique characteristics. First, it is affected
by the interaction with other laws and regulations. For example, in-home providers are classified as domestic service
workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. 206(a)) and are therefore covered under minimum wage
and tax requirements. Second, child care administrators have faced greater challenges in monitoring the quality
of care and the appropriateness of payments to in-home providers. These unique characteristics and the experience
of States, Territories and Tribes over the past several years indicate a need for greater flexibility as well as consistent
policies across funding streams.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The mandatory inclusion of in-home care in current CCDBG and IV&hyph;A regulations is intended to ensure a full range
of options to meet families' needs and to accurately reflect the child care market. However, because in-home care
is not required by statute and because States and other grantees have requested greater flexibility and consistency
across policies, we considered proposing that in-home care be made optional in both programs. However, we were concerned
that, because in-home care presents a number of administrative challenges, some States would unduly restrict the
availability of care for families who particularly need this type of setting or who lack other options. We therefore
decided not to make in-home care optional but to give States and other grantees greater flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are mindful that in-home care plays a valid and important role in the child care market place and that many participants
in subsidized care programs rely on care in their own homes to meet their family needs. Access to care which meets the
needs of individual families is critically important to parents and children, to schools and the workplace, and to
other community institutions which interface with the family. While in-home care represents only a small proportion
of all available care in most communities, it may be the best or only option for some families and may prove valuable,
necessary and cost-effective when compared to other options. Despite the challenges cited above, in-home care is
being successfully offered and has proven to be an important resource. For these reasons, we expect States and Tribes
to consider family and community circumstances carefully in establishing any conditions which will limit the availability
of in-home care. We are thus proposing that grantees include in their CCDBG plans a discussion of their policies for
in-home care and a rationale for their policy decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of conditions under which in-home care may be the most practical solution to a family's child care
needs. For example, the child's own home may be the only practical setting in rural areas or in areas where transportation
is particularly difficult. Employees who work nights, swing shifts, rotating shifts, weekends or other non-standard
hours may experience considerable difficulty in locating and maintaining satisfactory center-based or family
day care arrangements. Part-time employees often find it more difficult to make child care arrangements than do those
who work full-time. Similarly, families with more than one child or children of very different ages might be faced
with multiple child care arrangements if in-home care were unavailable. Many families also believe that very young
children are often best served in their own homes. Given the general paucity of school-age child care in many communities,
in-home supervision may enable some families to avoid latchkey situations before school, after school, and when
school is not in session. For many families, in-home care by relatives also represents an important cultural value
and may promote stability, cohesion and self-sufficiency in nuclear and extended families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also urge child care administrators to consider the capacity of local child care markets to meet existing demand
and the role that in-home care may play in the ability of parents to manage work and family life. Although in-home care
does not represent a large share of the national supply, it plays an important role in the structure and functioning
of local child care markets by extending the ability of parents to care for children within their own families, closing
gaps in the supply of community facilities, and creating a bridge between adult care and self- or sibling-care as children
near adolescence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States may choose to limit in-home care because of cost factors governed by minimum wage provisions of the FLSA
and other Federal and State requirements. For example, a State might determine that minimum wage requirements result
in payments for in-home care serving only one or two children that are much higher than the local market rate for other
categories. Therefore, the State could elect to limit in-home care to families in which three or more children require
care. The payment to the in-home provider would then be similar to the payment for care of the three children in other
settings. This ability to limit in-home care allows States to recognize the same cost restraints that families whose
care is unsubsidized must face. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACF recognizes that giving the States greater latitude to impose conditions and restrictions on in-home care may
affect parents' ability to make satisfactory arrangements and thus their ability to participate in work, education
or training. We also recognize the challenges of implementing health and safety requirements in the child's own home,
of monitoring in-home providers, and of complying with federal wage and tax laws governing domestic workers. Therefore,
we are seeking focused comments on our regulatory proposals for in-home care and would especially appreciate suggestions
on how to balance parental choice, cost effectiveness, and adherence to other Federal and State provisions, such
as the FLSA, that are unique to in-home settings.

ACF proposes to amend &sect;255.4(a)(3) (i) and (v) to give States the flexibility to eliminate the local market survey,
required by &sect;255.4(a)(2), as the basis for establishing local market rates for in-home care providers. The
proposed amendment provides that the local market rate for in-home providers must be at a level no lower than the level
required by Federal and State provisions which govern domestic service workers. The State may choose to establish
the local market rate at such a level without conducting the survey specified under &sect;255.4(a)(2). As an alternative,
the State has the option to conduct a local market rate survey for in-home care if the State believes that the local market
rate for such care is higher than that required by the FLSA and other Federal and State statutes.

The Effects Test and CCDBG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 658E(c)(2)(A) of the Block Grant Act requires States to provide assurances that parents are given the option
of (1) enrolling their children with a provider who has a grant or contract to provide services, or (2) receiving a child
care certificate with which to pay the provider of their choice. The Act also requires that children who are to be enrolled
in contracted slots must be placed with the provider of their parents' choice whenever possible. For the CCDBG program,
Congress clearly expected that parents would be able to choose from a wide variety of child care arrangements, including
care in private homes by relatives or family providers; in churches, synagogues or temples; in community centers
and schools; and in employer-provided facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the expectation that parents would be offered child care options, Congress clearly intended that CCDBG
grantees ensure the safety of children in care. Therefore, grantees are also required by statute to promulgate health
and safety regulations which adequately protect children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that Congress intended grantees to balance these provisions. In issuing the CCDBG regulations, ACF attempted
to regulate how grantees would implement this balance. In order to protect children, grantees were mandated to ensure
that health and safety requirements were in effect for all providers receiving funds under the CCDBG. Simultaneously,
ACF promulgated additional provisions, known as the ``effects test,'' which withheld CCDBG funds if the grantees
adopted requirements or procedures which had the effect of significantly limiting parental access to a category
of care or type of provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many grantees and advocates in the field of child care have pointed out the potential tension between these regulatory
provisions. In addition, many questions have been raised regarding the practical implementation of the effects
test and the criteria by which to judge that health and safety standards have actually limited parental choice. Most
compelling among such arguments has been the noted absence of statutory references to the effects test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are now proposing to eliminate the effects test. We do not intend and do not believe this proposal will weaken parental
choice. In subpart D of the CCDBG regulations, &sect;&sect;98.30&hyph;98.34 delineate parental rights and responsibilities.
We are not proposing to change anything in these sections that would in any way minimize the importance of parental
choice. Parental choice remains a requirement for CCDBG at &sect;98.30. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on two years of experience in the implementation of these programs, we do not believe that the effects test is
necessary to protect parental choice. We have substantial evidence that grantees are indeed offering parents a choice
of eligible providers through the design and operation of their certificate programs. In addition to information
gathered from administrative staff during 33 on-site program reviews, we heard from parents and providers in focus
group settings. Parents as well as providers spoke favorably about the choices that parents exercise in making arrangements
for their children. The findings of these program reviews, along with our ongoing review of child care plans, reveal
that grantees are operating certificate programs which fulfill the statutory parental choice directives. However,
based on the experience of grantees attempting to balance these provisions, we are seeking focused comments on the
potential impact of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose that the CCDBG rule be amended by removing &sect;98.30(g) which sets forth the effects test and by removing
related references at &sect;&sect;98.40(b)(2) (State and local regulatory requirements), 98.41(b) (health and
safety requirements), 98.43(c) (payment rates), and 98.45(d) (registration).

There is no specific statutory commitment to the principle of parental choice of providers in the title IV&hyph;A
child care programs as there is for the CCDBG program. Parental choice, however, is addressed in the current title
IV&hyph;A regulations. If more than one category of care is available, the regulations require the State to provide
the parent or caretaker relative with an opportunity to choose the arrangement. Also, the State IV&hyph;A agency
is required to establish at least one method by which self-arranged care may be paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be compatible with the current CCDBG regulations, the existing title IV&hyph;A child care regulations include
an effects test concerning the regulatory provisions that allow States to adopt the health and safety requirements
of other Federal or State child care programs. Additionally, they contain an effects test concerning the At-Risk
provider registration provisions which States must adopt. The title IV&hyph;A child care effects test is the same
as the effects test contained in the CCDBG regulations, i.e., that a State's requirements and procedures in those
areas may not have the effect of excluding any categories of child care providers. For the same reasons given for removing
the CCDBG effects test provisions, however, ACF proposes to remove the title IV&hyph;A effects tests requirements
at &sect;&sect;255.4(c)(2)(iii), 257.41(a)(3), and 257.41(b)(2)(v). We do not propose to, and do not believe this
action will, delete or weaken the current title IV&hyph;A parental choice provisions.

Immunizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We are proposing to amend the CCDBG health and safety regulations to require that grantees establish rules requiring
children receiving CCDBG services to be immunized. While this change affects only the CCDBG regulations, grantees
may apply the immunization requirement to title IV&hyph;A child care programs for a more seamless child care system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CCDBG statute currently includes references to immunizations. Section 658E(c)(2)(F) requires grantees to
provide assurances that provider requirements are in effect to protect the health and safety of children receiving
services under &sect;&sect;98.50 and 98.51, including ``the prevention and control of infectious diseases (including
immunizations).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 658E(c)(2)(G) of the Block Grant Act also requires grantees to assure that procedures are in effect which
ensure that child care providers comply with all applicable health and safety requirements described in paragraph
(F) of section 658E. However, section 658P(5)(B) allows grantees to exclude grandparents, aunts or uncles from provider
health and safety requirements. The current CCDBG regulations reiterate these statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveys of licensed child care facilities indicate that the majority of States require some proof of immunizations
for children enrolled in licensed or regulated child care centers and family day care homes. However, individual
States differ in their specific requirements and regulatory approaches. In addition, requirements for the immunization
of children in legally unlicensed care vary widely. Consequently, there is concern that current immunization policies
and practices may be inadequate to protect large numbers of young children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preventable diseases that were practically eliminated years ago are again infecting our youngest and most vulnerable
children. More than 55,000 measles cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between
1989 and 1991. In 1990, 64 deaths from measles were reported, the highest number in two decades. A survey conducted
by the CDC in 1991 found that only 37&hyph;56% of two-year-old children were fully vaccinated. (``Childhood Immunizations
Fact Sheet,'' Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC, February 12, 1993.) Since a large percentage
of children receiving assistance under the Block Grant program are under 5 years of age, we believe that the proposed
requirements will assist in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases among preschool age children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we propose amending &sect;98.41(a)(1) to require that grantees' health and safety plans include
specific provisions requiring children to be immunized in order to receive services under the CCDBG. State and Territorial
health and safety plans must incorporate (by reference or otherwise) the latest recommendations for childhood immunizations
of the respective State or Territorial Department of Public Health. Since there may not be a similar public health
authority for Tribes to follow regarding immunization standards, we are proposing to allow Tribes the option to determine
the immunization standards to be followed for children to receive CCDBG services. Tribes may choose standards set
forth by the State Public Health Department or the Indian Health Service. Tribes will be required to identify the source
of these standards in their CCDBG plans. In addition, we propose that all grantees consider requirements which include
provisions for documenting regular updates of the child's immunizations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Grantees have flexibility in the method of implementing this requirement. For example, grantees may require parents
to provide proof of immunization as part of the initial eligibility determination and again at redetermination,
or grantees may require child care providers to maintain proof of immunization for children enrolled in their care.
However, the requirements established by the grantee must apply to all children receiving CCDBG assistance and in
all child care settings, unless the child is in one of the exempt groups cited below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we propose to require children to be immunized in order to receive services, grantees may continue to exempt:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Children who are cared for by relatives (defined as grandparents, aunts and uncles); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Children who receive care in their own homes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Children whose parents object for religious reasons; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Children whose medical condition contraindicates immunization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing that children be immunized, we considered that parents may not always have had access to immunizations.
However, we believe that the increasing national focus on immunization will ease this difficulty. The President
has made vaccine delivery a national priority and has signed into law the Vaccine for Children program which provides
free vaccines to States for the inoculation of uninsured children, children eligible for Medicaid, and Native American
children. Underinsured children whose health insurance does not cover immunizations are also eligible to be served
by Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics. The new program will also allow federally purchased
vaccine to be distributed to private physicians to vaccinate eligible children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where grantees impose burdens on providers to check on the immunization status of children in their care and to ensure
that necessary immunizations are received, we would expect grantees to assist providers in meeting these requirements.
At a minimum, the assistance should include: (1) Provision of updated immunization schedules; (2) information on
the availability of free vaccines; and (3) information on locations where parents of eligible children can be referred
for immunizations. These expectations are consistent with section 658E(c)(2)(G) of the CCDBG statute which requires
that procedures be in place to ensure that providers comply with applicable health and safety requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also expect that some children may not have all of the required immunizations at the time eligibility is determined.
In order to ensure that children eligible to receive services under the Block Grant are not denied services, we recommend
that grantees establish a grace period in which children can receive services while taking the necessary actions
to comply with the requirements. Grantees will be required to describe the grace period allowed to these families
in their CCDBG plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The health of all children is important, and we therefore strongly encourage immunizations for children receiving
title IV&hyph;A child care. However, we believe that there is no authority under the Social Security Act to require
immunizations for children receiving title IV&hyph;A child care and therefore we cannot propose a parallel regulation
for title IV&hyph;A child care. Unlike the CCDBG statutory mandate for State requirements for the prevention and
control of infectious diseases, including immunization, for all providers, the Social Security Act is silent. Nevertheless,
we wish to emphasize that States already have the necessary flexibility to choose to require immunizations for children
receiving title IV&hyph;A care under the existing title IV&hyph;A applicable standards regulations. The application
to title IV&hyph;A child care of the proposed immunization requirement would facilitate the seamless delivery of
child care services across programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicable standards regulations at &sect;&sect;255.4 and 257.41 require title IV&hyph;A child care providers
to meet any generally applicable standard of State, local or Tribal law. Additionally, the applicable standards
regulations allow States to deny payment for care that does not meet the additional standards used in other Federal
(e.g., CCDBG) or State child care programs in the area of prevention and control of infectious diseases, including
immunizations. Thus additional Federal regulations are not necessary for title IV&hyph;A child care for States
to have the ability to require consistent health and safety standards, including the proposed immunization requirement.

Foster Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We are clarifying that CCDBG grantees have the flexibility to include foster care in their definition of protective
services. The preamble to the existing regulations distinguishes between protective services cases and children
placed in foster care by allowing child care subsidies for foster care cases only if the foster parent is working, in
education or in training. The distinction made in the preamble was an interpretation of the regulatory language.
The regulation discusses child protective services only; it is silent on foster care. This change in interpretation
does not require a regulatory change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many States, foster care is an integral part of the protective services system. It is one of the many services provided
to children and families who, for a variety of reasons, may need protective intervention. A child is placed in foster
care when remaining in the home places him or her at risk. States, acting in loco parentis, may provide on-going supportive
services to meet the developmental needs and redress developmental delays which may exist as a result of neglect or
abuse. These services are available both for a child who remains in his or her own home and for a child in a foster placement.
For purposes of protective services benefits, some grantees do not differentiate between the protective services
for families who remain intact and for those children who are in a foster placement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the existing regulations, a child in a family that is receiving, or needs to receive, some type of
protective, interventive services can be eligible for child care subsidies under CCDBG if he or she remains in his
or her own home even if the parent is not working, in education or in training. However, such therapeutic child care
outside of the home may be a necessary part of the individual child's supportive services plan regardless of the child's
living situation. In these cases, child care is needed to carry out the social services plan for the child and the family_not
necessarily because the parent is working, in education or in training. Therefore we are changing our interpretation
of the regulation to allow States the option of including children in foster care in the State's definition of protective
services cases.

Allowing CCDBG grantees to include foster care in their definition of protective services not only gives grantees
the flexibility to work within existing child protective services systems, it is also consistent with the goals of
the recently enacted Family Support and Preservation Act. This Act promotes integrated and comprehensive services
for families already receiving supportive and/or interventive assistance from social services agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees electing to include foster care in their definition of protective services will be required to state this
in their Block Grant Plan. Those grantees choosing to exclude foster care from their definition of protective services
must define eligibility for participation in CCDBG child care subsidies in terms of the foster parent working, in
education or in training.

Certificate Availability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 658E(c)(2)(A) of the CCDBG Act requires States to provide assurances that parents are given the option of
(1) Enrolling their children with a provider who has a grant or contract to provide services, or (2) receiving a child
care certificate with which to pay the provider of their choice. The Act also requires that children who are to be enrolled
in contracted slots must be placed with the provider of their parents' choice whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CCDBG regulation elaborates on the choice between grant/contract child care and a child care certificate by requiring
that a certificate must be offered when child care services under &sect;98.50 are made available to a parent. We do
not propose any changes to this requirement which is stated both at &sect;98.30(a) and &sect;98.30(e). However,
we do propose removing &sect;98.30(e) because it is redundant to a clearer and more expanded presentation of parental
choice set forth in &sect;98.30(a) (1) and (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also using the opportunity provided by this proposed rule to clarify the certificate requirement and to offer
examples of grantee systems which have successfully met this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our restatement of the regulatory position that certificates must be available whenever services under &sect;98.50
are offered does not preclude grantees from entering into grants or contracts for child care services. Depending
upon the child care needs of the eligible population in discrete geographic areas of service, grants and contracts
may be necessary to provide stable child care for participating populations or specific communities. In essence,
the provision requires a good faith effort by the grantee to balance the allocation of funds between grants/contracts
and certificates to ensure that parents have optimum choice among quality child care options as stipulated in the
legislation and reinforced in the existing regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting on-site program reviews over the past two years, we have found that grantees are operating certificate
programs which offer parental choice. Some grantees are offering only certificates. Others are committing funds
on a proportional basis between certificates and contracts based on the particular needs of individual areas or populations.
Some grantees, however, have experienced that stable child care is more difficult to find in rural or inner-city areas,
for infants, or for children with special needs and have therefore contracted with competent providers to specifically
address these shortages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In planning the distribution of funds for grants/contracts and certificates, grantees should establish sufficient
fiscal flexibility to ensure that parents who choose certificates are not placed on a waiting list while substantial
numbers of contracted slots in the same area remain un-utilized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, most grantees are reporting that the need for subsidized low-income child care far exceeds the available
funding. Thus, if certificate funds are fully reserved for children who are already enrolled, and no subsidized slots
are available (either filled or not part of the grantee's program), it may be necessary to begin a waiting list for certificates.
Similarly, because many grantees are allocating funds on a locality by locality basis, waiting lists may result in
some parts of the State while services are still available in other areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We want to clarify that although certificates must be an option for parents whenever &sect;98.50 services are offered,
it is not necessary to offer certificates whenever &sect;98.50 services are being used. For example, if all CCDBG
funds available in a community are ``reserved'' for specific children in contracted and certificate-funded slots,
the grantee is not actually offering services and need not offer additional certificates. Thus, a local program might
not offer new child care services during some portion of the program year because all available funds have been assigned
to specific children and are being used or ``reserved'' for those specific children.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Currently, CCDBG grantees may spend up to 10 percent of CCDBG funds authorized under &sect;98.50 (the 75 percent monies)
for program administration and activities to improve the availability and quality of child care services. If expenditures
for operating the certificate program and related consumer education equal or exceed 10 percent, grantees may petition
for an additional five percent for other authorized activities, for a total of 15 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information provided by grantees in their annual reports and during on-site program reviews, we now propose
to allow grantees to use up to 15 percent of funds authorized under &sect;98.50 for ongoing activities related to program
administration, quality and availability without further justification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In proposing this change, we acknowledge the cost implications of complex interrelationships among program administration,
quality services and availability of child care options in the context of rapidly increasing family and community
needs. Many States and localities want to develop more cohesive, integrated and sophisticated child care management,
delivery and payment systems. Activities undertaken under &sect;98.50(d) can contribute to the development of
child care systems which more effectively support informed consumer choice and the delivery of quality care through
community-based providers. This change will provide grantees with the flexibility to balance priorities and develop
more responsive child care programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we propose that the CCDBG rules be amended to specify that the amount generally allowed for activities
related to administration, quality and availability is 15 percent at &sect;98.50(d)(2)(ii). Therefore, the amount
specified for direct services is at least 85 percent at &sect;98.50(d)(2)(i). The change will also remove &sect;98.50(d)(3)
which requires grantees to petition for the additional five percent and remove a reference to &sect;98.50(d)(3)
which occurs in &sect;98.52(c). It will also remove a related reference at &sect;98.13(a)(6)(ii).

Availability of Funds

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992, section 658J(c) of the CCDBG Act was amended
to eliminate the time restrictions on obligation and to extend the length of time grantees have to expend funds received
each fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Block Grant funds awarded to States and Territories had previously been available for obligation by the grantee in
the fiscal year in which the grant funds were awarded and in the succeeding fiscal year (year 2). Unliquidated obligations
at the end of year 2 were to be liquidated during the next fiscal year (year 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory amendments eliminate the restrictions on obligation of funds by States and Territories by providing
that CCDBG funds are expendable in the fiscal year in which they are awarded and in the three (3) succeeding fiscal years.
For Tribal grantees, the amendments also extend the expenditure period from three (3) fiscal years to four (4) fiscal
years. Thus, the expenditure period for all grantees (States, Territories, exempt Tribes and non-exempt Tribes)
now extends to four (4) fiscal years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments were not effective in time to remove the September 30, 1992, obligation restriction on FY 1991 grant
funds awarded to States and Territories. However, the amendments do provide an additional year to expend funds for
obligations made with FY 1991 funds, so that States and Territories now have until September 30, 1994 (rather than
September 30, 1993), to expend FY 1991 funds which were obligated by September 30, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribal grantees who received FY 1991 funds were required to expend their funds by September 30, 1993. Because the amendments
provide an additional year during which FY 1991 funds may be expended, Tribal grantees have until September 30, 1994,
to expend their FY 1991 grants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, for all grantees (States, Territories and Tribes), FY 1992 and subsequent fiscal years' funds must be
expended by the end of the expenditure period (the fiscal year in which the funds are awarded plus the three succeeding
fiscal years). To reflect these changes, we propose amending &sect;98.2 by removing and reserving paragraph (z)
and revising paragraphs (y) and (cc) and &sect;98.60 by revising paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(4), (h)(1), and (h)(3) and
removing paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), (e), and (h)(2).

We propose revising &sect;98.63(a)(1) and (b) to change the dates by which States must report funds for reallotment
to other State grantees. Reallotment rules do not affect Territories or Tribal grantees since those grantees may
not receive reallotted funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each fiscal year, States must specify the amount of any CCDBG funds which will be available for reallocation or else
report that all funds will be expended. The deadline for submission of this information was previously April 1 of the
second fiscal year of the obligation period. As a result of the extension of the expenditure deadline by section 8 of
the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992, the date by which States must report CCDBG funds
for reallotment has been extended to April 1 of the fourth (and last) fiscal year of the expenditure period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the amendments did not remove the September 30, 1992 obligation deadline for FY 1991 grant funds, this change
in reporting did not affect FY 1991 awards. For FY 1992 funds, States must report on the availability of funds for reallotment
by April 1, 1995. Funds reallotted from one fiscal year's grant are subject to the same period of availability as the
grant year from which the funds were awarded. Thus, FY 1992 funds, if any, reallotted in May of 1995 must be expended
by September 30, 1995.

In &sect;98.70, the CCDBG rule requires grantees to submit annual reports to the Secretary by December 31. This provision
is not affected by the extension of the expenditure period by section 8 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
Amendments of 1992. Each report must specify expenditures made by September 30 of the year in which the report is submitted
to the Secretary, with each fiscal year's funds accounted for separately. However, we are proposing to revise &sect;98.70
to more clearly state the requirement and to delete those requirements no longer applicable.

Child Care That Is ``Reasonably Related'' To Parent's Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the regulations for title IV&hyph;A child care, a State must assure in the State Supportive Services Plan that
child care provided or claimed for reimbursement is reasonably related to the hours of participation in JOBS or in
other State-approved education and training (for care under part 255) or employment (for care under parts 255, 256
and 257). ACF recognized that many individuals would participate in education, training and employment on less than
a full-time basis, but decided not to regulate a definition of what constitutes child care that is reasonably related
to the parent's hours of participation or employment. Rather, we gave States the flexibility and, we believed, the
authority to develop their own policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During our discussions with States, however, we learned that there is some misunderstanding or disagreement about
who has the responsibility for establishing policies on what constitutes an amount of child care that is reasonably
related to the parent's training or employment. For example, internal or external reviews or audits have questioned
how a State determined that the child care under review was reasonably related to the parent's activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACF continues to maintain that State IV&hyph;A agencies should establish their own policies for what constitutes
a ``reasonably related'' amount of child care. Therefore, we propose to have the State include in its Supportive Services
Plan a description of its policy on what constitutes child care that is reasonably related to the parent's hours of
participation in education, training or employment by revising &sect;&sect;255.1(e)(4) and 257.21(a)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including the State's ``reasonably related'' child care policy in the federally approved Supportive Services Plan
will clarify the IV&hyph;A agency's role in developing and articulating the State's policy in this area. By having
written policy on ``reasonably related,'' States should avoid such disputes with potential reviewers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing this regulation, we wish to clarify the difference between a policy which addresses paying for child
care when a child is absent from regularly scheduled care (e.g. due to illness) and a policy which describes what is
reasonably related child care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``reasonably related'' child care policy correlates the parent's activities with the amount of child care that
the IV&hyph;A agency views as necessary based on the parent's activities and in consideration of other factors that
the agency regards as significant. For example, States may wish to include such factors as the individual needs of
the recipient family, the availability or lack of care alternatives in a local market area, need for continuity of
care by a specific caregiver, or the needs of a Head Start Agency to meet operating expenses for wrap-around child care.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the ``reasonably related'' policy which relates the parent's activity to an amount of child care, an
absence policy addresses the fact that children will occasionally miss child care especially due to illness. A State's
absence policy would establish when a State would pay for child care even when the child is absent. FFP is available
for payments made in accordance with a State's absence policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``reasonably related'' policy the State describes in its approved Supportive Services Plan will become the standard
against which actual payments will be judged, for example, for audit purposes. We therefore advise the State to articulate
its policy clearly to all individuals responsible for approving the payment or reimbursement of child care services.

Under the regulations for AFDC child care at part 255 and Transitional Child Care (TCC) at part 256, the determination

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing policy was adopted to be consistent with the regulations concerning exemption from participation in
the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program found in part 250. Exemptions from participation
in JOBS are available for a number of reasons, including physical or mental incapacity. Since incapacity would provide
a long and perhaps permanent period of exemption from activities that would prepare an individual for entry into the
work force, a high standard of professional verification by a physician or licensed or certified psychologist was
adopted. After experience with the child care programs, we do not believe that receiving child care services under
parts 255 and 256 requires such rigorous verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, when the CCDBG program and the At-Risk Child Care program were implemented after JOBS, both programs,
by regulation, provided for care of a child over age 13 who is physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself
or herself. The regulations for those programs at parts 98 and 257, respectively, permit the State to make the determination
of physical or mental incapacity. Those regulations also require States to include a definition of the term ``physically
or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself'' in the applicable State Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to amend the child care regulations at parts 255 and 256 to be compatible with the regulations of the other
child care programs. These proposed changes will ease State administration of child care programs while continuing
to ensure that eligibility is properly documented. We therefore propose to amend &sect;&sect;255.2(a) and 256.2(a)
to provide State flexibility in determining physical or mental incapacity. We also propose to add &sect;&sect;255.1(m)
and 256.1(a)(5) to require the State to provide its definitions of physical or mental incapacity in the applicable
State Plan.

Gaps in Employment and Child Care Under Title IV&hyph;A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We propose to modify the regulatory language at &sect;255.2(d)(2) to allow States the additional option to continue
child care for families that lose a job but are searching for another job. Under the proposed regulation at &sect;255.2(d)(2)(ii)
care can be continued for up to one month of job search if the care arrangements would otherwise be lost. This is an expansion
of the existing regulation which provides for a continuation of care for up to one month only if an activity is scheduled
to begin within that month and the arrangements would otherwise be lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that giving States this additional option to continue child care for a limited period of job search is supportive
of families who may have to change employment and recognizes that it is not always possible to secure another job immediately
following a job loss. Under the existing regulations, States have had the option to extend child care services that
would otherwise be lost for a limited period both when another activity is already scheduled to begin within that period
and when there is a short period of absence from an on-going job. The proposed regulation broadens the State's ability
to serve families for whom continuity of care would assist their movement towards self-sufficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to amend the At-Risk regulations at &sect;257.30(c) to be consistent with the proposed change at &sect;255.2(d)(2)(ii)
to allow States the option to continue child care for up to one month for families that lose a job but are searching for
another job. Additionally, we propose to amend &sect;257.30(c) to delete the requirement that child care for the
two-week period prior to the start of a job may be provided only if ``the child care arrangements would otherwise be
lost.'' We believe that the two-week period may be needed to provide child care in order to prepare for employment.
We propose that at State option child care may be available for up to two weeks before employment without restriction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making these changes to the regulations at &sect;&sect;255.2(d) and 257.30(c), we recognized that the existing
regulations for care under part 256 (TCC) are silent on the provision of child care during gaps between jobs. In JOBS&hyph;FSA&hyph;AT&hyph;90&hyph;8,
dated June 29, 1990, we clarified that families are eligible for TCC during gaps in employment. This proposed rule
at &sect;256.2(f) thus codifies existing policy and mirrors the amended policy concerning gaps in employment in
parts 255 and 257. Care provided during a break in employment, that is, when the family is not working, does not extend
the family's 12-month eligibility period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to make a corresponding amendment to the regulations at &sect;256.1(a) for the State Supportive Services
Plan which addresses Transitional Child Care. We propose that the plan reflect whether the State has elected to allow
child care during gaps in employment under TCC pursuant to the proposed &sect;256.2(f).

We propose to amend the regulations of the TCC program at &sect;256.2(a) to allow the State to determine ``physical

Voluntary Cessation of AFDC and Eligibility for TCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We propose to amend &sect;256.2(b)(1) by adding a new subparagraph (ii) to allow States the option of making families
who voluntarily terminate receipt of an AFDC benefit eligible for TCC. Under this option, working families that receive
AFDC could request that their AFDC be terminated and still become eligible for TCC, provided that they meet all other
TCC eligibility requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulation, which we propose to redesignate as &sect;256.2(b)(1)(i), requires that a family's eligibility
for TCC is based on a loss of eligibility for AFDC due to the increased hours of employment, increased income from employment
or loss of the income disregards due to time limits. In our consultations we have heard concerns that some working families
find themselves ineligible for TCC because they voluntarily leave AFDC when they are still entitled to a grant. Therefore,
we propose to allow the State the option to provide TCC to those working families who voluntarily request that their
AFDC be terminated because their hours or income from employment have increased or they have lost the income disregards
due to time limits, but are still eligible for AFDC. This policy, coupled with our proposal to give States the option
to eliminate the need for a request for TCC, should allow States to provide TCC to more families, while easing the administrative
burden on them to provide that service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not proposing to require States to provide TCC in voluntary closure cases because we are unsure of the administrative
and fiscal impacts on States. At the same time, we want our regulations to support families who take the initiative
to get jobs and move off AFDC. Therefore, we are interested in receiving comments as to whether it would be more appropriate
to allow or to require States to provide TCC in voluntary closure cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to revise the regulations concerning the State Supportive Services Plan at &sect;256.1(a)(6) to include
information on whether the State elects to provide TCC to working families who voluntarily cease to receive AFDC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Requesting TCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing regulations require States to provide information to families about their potential eligibility for
TCC, the steps they need to take to request TCC services, and their rights and responsibilities under the program.
States must provide this information during initial application for AFDC, during orientation to the JOBS program,
at redetermination of eligibility for AFDC benefits and at termination of AFDC benefits. ACF issued an Action Transmittal
(CC&hyph;ACF&hyph;AT&hyph;92&hyph;3), dated June 16, 1992, that reiterated the necessity for all families to
be informed about TCC ``in writing, and orally as appropriate, at the time they become ineligible for AFDC.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations also require that all families request TCC before services are provided. ACF did not regulate
the nature of the request or application process. Rather we encouraged States to make the process simple, citing the
example of a current recipient for whom the State might approve TCC through a recertification process if the necessary
information was on file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have, however, heard concerns that the requirement for the family to request services may have discouraged some
families from seeking TCC or caused disruption in child care arrangements. This requirement is especially frustrating
for families when necessary information is already on file with the State agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we propose at &sect;256.2(b)(3) to give States the option to provide TCC, without requiring a request,
to eligible families. We believe that such a policy would be most applicable to families who were approved for child
care services under part 255. For example, an AFDC recipient reports her newly-begun job to her AFDC case manager.
At that time, the case manager determines that the family will remain eligible for AFDC until the time limitations
on the income disregard at &sect;233.20(a)(11) cause the family to lose AFDC eligibility. Because the case manager
recognizes that the family will be eligible for TCC in four months, if circumstances remain the same, she obtains the
necessary information with which to determine eligibility and establish the level of the family's fee for TCC, if
any. Continuing child care services in this instance would be possible because all the appropriate information is
available to determine TCC eligibility, including fees, when the family loses eligibility for AFDC and transitions
to TCC. Adopting this option can make the delivery of title IV&hyph;A child care services more seamless for the family.
Additionally, the transition from child care services provided under part 255 to TCC services may well be ``transparent''
to the family if the State also adopts the proposed option to waive TCC fees for those families who are at or below the
poverty level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
However, in adopting the option to continue child care services without a request for TCC, the State must still provide
all of the required notifications, including appeals rights, regarding the termination of AFDC benefits and child
care services pursuant to &sect;&sect;205.10 or 250.36 as appropriate. The family must also be notified of the requirements
for their continued eligibility for TCC, including the payment of fees if applicable, pursuant to the requirements
at &sect;&sect;256.2, 256.3 and 256.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose amending &sect;256.1(a)(6)(i) to have States specify in their Supportive Services Plan whether they
have adopted this option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing this option we recognize that, in some cases (e.g., where a State does not have current or complete information
on a family), a State may find it difficult to provide TCC in the absence of a request. Therefore, the State will still
need a mechanism in place to collect the information necessary to determine eligibility and payments. For many families,
the need for child care will not arise until they get a job which terminates their AFDC eligibility. Other families
who leave AFDC due to employment may not need child care at that time (e.g., because their child is enrolled in Head Start),
but may need care subsequently. Whenever the need for child care arises, the State must make a prompt determination
of eligibility for TCC in order to assist the family. ACF remains concerned that States have not established such timely,
efficient procedures. The request or application process should be simple so as not to hinder the applicant's ability
to accept work or continue working. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we continue to hear concerns that the requirement for a request for TCC is problematic and that TCC utilization
is low, we are requesting comments on whether: (1) This provision to make requests optional is a sufficient response;
(2) the request requirement constitutes a serious barrier to the receipt of TCC; and (3) other changes should be made
to make TCC more accessible to eligible families.

Retroactive Requests for TCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing rule at &sect;256.2(c) specifically provides for families to receive TCC ``notwithstanding when the
family requests assistance under this Part *&blank;*&blank;*.'' States have asked whether they may establish a
cut-off date for TCC requests as they have received requests after the family's 12-month period of TCC eligibility
has expired. There is no existing Federal policy which addresses a cut-off date for TCC requests following the 12-month
eligibility period. We believe a cut-off date should be a State decision. We propose to revise &sect;256.2(c) and
add a new paragraph &sect;256.2(g) to provide States the authority to establish a reasonable time limit for accepting
TCC requests following the close of the eligibility period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to amend &sect;256.4(c) to require States which have elected to establish a time limit for accepting
requests for TCC, pursuant to &sect;256.2(g), to notify families of the time limit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In order to be compatible with the At-Risk Child Care Program at &sect;257.31(c) and CCDBG at &sect;98.42(c), we propose
to amend the TCC regulation that requires some level of contribution to the cost of TCC by all recipients. Section 402(g)(1)(A)(vii)
of the Act requires a family to contribute to the cost of TCC according to its ability to pay. The existing regulations
at &sect;256.3(b) require that a sliding fee be established that provides for some level of contribution by all recipients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case with At-Risk families, families eligible for TCC are only one step away from actual receipt of AFDC. We
believe it is appropriate to give States the option to treat TCC families the same as other similarly-situated families
in the State. Therefore, we propose to revise &sect;256.3(b) to give States the option to waive the contribution from
a family whose income is at or below the poverty level for a family of the same size.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to amend the regulations for hazardous waste management
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by listing as hazardous waste solids and filter cartridges
from the production of 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The Agency is also proposing to add 2,4,6-tribromophenol to the list
of commercial chemical products that are hazardous wastes when discarded. As a necessary part of this hazardous waste
listing EPA is proposing to add 2,4,6-tribromophenol to the RCRA list of hazardous constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation, if promulgated, will subject the listed 2,4,6-tribromophenol wastes to regulation as
hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. In addition, 2,4,6-tribromophenol and the listed wastes will automatically
become hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA). EPA is proposing for purposes of immediate release reporting under CERCLA section 103 a reportable quantity
(RQ) of 100 pounds for 2,4,6-tribromophenol and the listed wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, EPA is proposing not to list as hazardous nine waste streams from the production of bromochloromethane, ethyl
bromide, tribromophenol, octabromodiphenyl oxide, decabromodiphenyl oxide, and to defer action on one waste stream
from the production of tetrabromobisphenol-A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations are proposed under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). These statutes are commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) and are codified at Volume 42 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), sections 6901 to 6992k (42 U.S.C. 6901&hyph;6992k).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3001(a) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921(a), requires EPA to promulgate criteria for identifying characteristics
of hazardous wastes and for listing hazardous wastes. Section 3001(b) of RCRA requires EPA to promulgate regulations,
based on these criteria, identifying and listing hazardous wastes which shall be subject to the requirements of the
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazardous waste is defined at section 1004(5) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6903(5). There are two types of hazardous waste. First,
hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality,
serious irreversible illness, or incapacitating reversible illness. In addition, hazardous wastes are those solid
wastes which may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly
managed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's regulations establishing criteria for listing hazardous wastes are codified at volume 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) &sect;261.11 (40 CFR 261.11). Section 261.11 states three criteria for identifying characteristics
and for listing wastes as hazardous.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, wastes may be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they have the properties described at 40 CFR 261.20
which would cause them to be classified as having the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity
and toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, wastes may be classified as acute hazardous wastes if they are fatal to humans at low doses, lethal in animal
studies at particular doses designated in the regulation, or otherwise capable of causing or significantly contributing
to an increase in serious illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, wastes may be listed as hazardous if they contain hazardous constituents identified in appendix VIII of 40
CFR part 261 and the Agency concludes, after considering eleven factors enumerated in &sect;261.11(a)(3), that
the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly
managed. A substance is listed in appendix VIII if it has been shown in scientific studies to have toxic effects on life
forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastes listed as hazardous are subject to federal requirements under RCRA for persons who generate, transport, treat,
store or dispose of such waste. Facilities that must meet the hazard waste management requirements, including the
need to obtain permits to operate, are commonly referred to as Subtitle C facilities. Subtitle C is Congress' original
statutory designation for that part of RCRA that directs EPA to issue regulations for hazardous wastes as may be necessary
to protect human health or the environment. Thus, facilities like incinerators or landfills that are required to
comply with RCRA requirements for hazardous waste are referred to as Subtitle C incinerators or landfills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle C is codified as Subchapter III of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of the United States Code,
42 U.S.C. 6921 thru 6939e. EPA standards and procedural regulations implementing subtitle C are found generally
at 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solid wastes which are not hazardous wastes may be disposed of at facilities which are overseen by state and local governments.
These are the so-called subtitle D facilities. Subtitle D is Congress' original statutory designation for that part
of RCRA which deals with federal assistance to state and regional planning efforts for disposal of solid waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle D is codified as Subchapter IV of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of the United States Code (42
U.S.C. 6941 thru 6949a). EPA regulations affecting subtitle D facilities are found generally at 40 CFR parts 240 thru
247, and 255 thru 258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6921 (e)(2) requires EPA to determine whether to list, as hazardous, wastes
generated by various chemical production processes, including the production of organobromines. In response to
this mandate, the Agency undertook a two-year study of the industry and, eventually, listed several wastes from the
production of ethylene dibromide (EDB) and methyl bromide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule listing wastes from the production of EDB was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 13, 1986 (51 FR 5327). These wastes are listed in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations section 261.32
(40 CFR 261.32) and are designated by EPA hazardous waste numbers K117, K118, and K136. The final rule listing wastes
from methyl bromide production was published on October 6, 1989 (54 FR 41402). These wastes are listed at 40 CFR 261.32
and are designated by hazardous waste codes K131 and K132. Methyl bromide and ethylene dibromide are also on the Appendix
VIII list of hazardous constituents.

 Civ. No. 89&hyph;0598 (D.D.C.)), in which the Agency agreed to publish a proposed determination as to whether or not
to list as hazardous wastes from the production of five other organobromine chemicals by April 30, 1994 and to promulgate
a final decision on whether to list on or before April 30, 1995. The Agency reserves the right to evaluate wastes from
the production of other organobromine compounds in the future, if and when such an evaluation is deemed necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide a sound technical basis for this listing determination, EPA conducted another study of the organobromine
chemicals industry in 1991 and 1992. Six firms were identified as currently manufacturing organobromine chemicals
at eight facilities in the United States. Under the authority of RCRA Section 3007 (42 U.S.C. 6927), EPA sent questionnaires
to these firms and four of them were selected for engineering site visits. These four facilities account for over 99
percent of total production. Samples of process residuals were collected during the site visits to familiarize the
Agency with the types of materials generated by the industry. Later in the study, record samples were collected at
facilities of the two largest domestic producers. The next section summarizes today's proposal and describes the
basis for EPA's decision to list one waste from this industry. The Listing Background Document for this listing determination
contains a detailed description of the Agency's basis for proposing to list one waste, and to not list ten other waste
streams. The public version of this document, which does not contain Confidential Business Information can be copied
at the RCRA public docket. See

 section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third criteria described above for listing hazardous wastes in 40 CFR 261.11, is applicable to this proposal on
organobromine wastes. That is, wastes may be listed if they contain hazardous constituents identified in Appendix
VIII of 40 CFR Part 261 and the Agency concludes the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard
to human health or the environment when improperly managed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the other two criteria, the wastes under consideration here are not acutely hazardous and ``characteristic''
wastes are not listed separately, since their classification depends upon whether they qualify as wastes based on
various tests described in the regulations. EPA notes that any of the organobromine wastes could be classified as
``characteristic'' wastes if they ``fail'' the applicable tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with its regulations, EPA determined whether there were present any Appendix VIII constituents and whether
there was information on any other constituents of the waste that could lead to health or environmental concerns.
The health effects data, along with other factors (generally related to exposure) required to be considered under
40 CFR 261.11(a)(3), were then evaluated to decide whether the wastes should be listed as hazardous wastes. These
factors include the plausible types of mismanagement scenarios to which the wastes could be subjected and the potential
of the constituent or any toxic degradation product to migrate from waste into the environment under the improper
management scenarios (40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) (iii) and (vii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of data on health effects and exposure to the wastestreams, EPA decided that certain wastes from
2,4,6-tribromophenol production warrant listing. None of the constituents have previously been listed in Appendix
VIII, however. Accordingly, EPA is proposing to list 2,4,6-tribromophenol as an Appendix VIII constituent.

II. Summary of Today's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Organobromine Chemicals Industry Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The organobromine chemical-producing industry in the U.S. is geographically limited by the location of underground
bromide-bearing brine deposits. The only major deposits of this type in the United States are located in Michigan
and Arkansas. Organobromine chemicals are no longer produced on a large scale in Michigan. EPA identified two firms
in southern Arkansas that produce the organobromine chemicals listed in the EDF consent decree. These two firms account
for 95% of all organobromine chemical production in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source of all bromine produced currently in the U.S. is the brine deposit in the Smackover Formation in Union, Lafayette,
and Columbia Counties, Arkansas. Total demand for bromine has fallen 25% since 1979 and domestic bromine production
fell by four thousand metric tons between 1991 and 1992, so there is little incentive for the construction of new bromine
extraction plants. In addition, all of the mining rights for bromine-bearing brines in these counties are controlled
by two corporations. According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, these deposits are likely to satisfy domestic demand for
sixty years. For these reasons, EPA believes that it is very improbable that any new producers using substantially
different technologies will enter the organobromine chemicals industry during the next several decades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the first industry study in 1984, ethylene dibromide (EDB) was the most important product of the organobromines
industry. EDB was used together with tetraethyl lead in additives designed to increase the octane rating of gasoline.
Other industry products included methyl bromide, used as a soil fumigant, and brominated fluorocarbons, which are
sold mainly as fire-extinguishing agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the decade that has elapsed since the original industry study, the product mix has changed, due primarily to
the advent of several environmental regulatory programs. Vehicles requiring unleaded gasoline were introduced
to the U.S. market in 1971, and the phase-out of leaded gasoline is now almost complete. Other nations have instituted
similar programs, though on different timetables, which has reduced demand for EDB. The use of methyl bromide as a
soil fumigant has been restricted because of the toxicity of this material. Two of the important brominated fluorocarbons,
Halon 1211 and Halon 1301, are being phased out of production under the terms of the Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer, to which the United States is a signatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of organobromine chemicals manufactured currently are sold as flame retardants. Most of these are solid
compounds that are incorporated into polymer mixes. The polymers then are used to manufacture a variety of household
and industrial products, including electronic circuit boards, television and computer cases, and packaging and
insulating foam. Smaller volume organobromine chemicals are produced by four smaller firms. The principal uses
for these products are as reagent chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates. These low volume chemicals are produced
on a batch basis with annual production often being a few batches per year.

1. Processes Used and Wastes Generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, EPA conducted engineering site visits at four organobromine-producing firms, based on the information
received from RCRA Section 3007 questionnaires. Two of these four firms have direct access to sources of elemental
bromine (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the underground brine deposits) and use it to produce substantial volumes of organobromine flame retardants. All
other firms in the industry purchase elemental bromine and use it to produce smaller volumes of special-purpose pharmaceutical
and chemical intermediates. Frequently, these items are produced under contract for the pharmaceutical firms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The processes at the two major sites also differ from those at the smaller producers with respect to waste management
practices. The smaller producers manage all of their solid wastes as hazardous and ship them off site to incinerators
or landfills operating in accordance with the standards promulgated under authority of RCRA Subtitle C. Generally,
their production contracts call for the wastes to be sent to the firms ordering these chemicals. The pharmaceutical
firms then incinerate these wastes from the organochemical production process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because bromine is an element and cannot be destroyed by chemical transformations, the production processes at the
major facilities are designed to make the most effective use of all bromine extracted from the brine. As a result, there
are many bromine/bromide recovery processes built into the operation. A generalized description of the wastes and
management practices at the major sites follows.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bromide-bearing brine from the Smackover Formation is pumped to the surface and routed to the bromine plant, where
it is acidified, and chlorinated to convert the bromide to bromine. The reaction generates a sodium chloride by-product
which remains in the brine. The bromine then is volatilized with steam and condensed, dried, and used on site as a feedstock.
Most organobromine chemicals are produced by simple one- or two-step reactions of bromine with an organic feedstock.
Many of these reactions liberate hydrogen bromide gas, which is normally scrubbed in sodium hydroxide solution,
forming a sodium bromide stream that often is recycled to the bromine plant. Alternatively, the gas is scrubbed with
a lime suspension to produce calcium bromide, a saleable by-product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concentrated sulfuric acid is used as a drying agent for elemental bromine. The spent acid is sold back to the sulfuric
acid producer, who uses it to produce virgin sulfuric acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At major production sites, process wastewaters containing recoverable amounts of bromine are recycled to the bromine
plant for bromine recovery. The volume of these wastewater streams exceeds that of all other waste streams combined.
Additionally, over 200,000 metric tons per year of unrecycled process wastewaters are generated at the two major
sites from production of the five organobromine chemicals listed in the consent decree. An additional 450,000 tons
of wastewaters are generated from tribromophenol manufacture. Less than 800 tons of process wastes solids are generated.
These include spent filters, floor sweepings and chemical product that does not meet commercial specifications
for quality_so-called ``off-spec'' product. By comparison, the amount of waste generated by the minor producers
is cumulatively less than 100 tons and is divided among several dozen processes, most of which are operated only a few
days per year. Due to the very low volumes and periodic generation of these wastes by the minor producers, the analysis
for this listing determination focused only on the major production plants. The minor producers do not manufacture
any of the products listed in the EDF consent decree. Table I summarizes the wastes and their constituents of potential
concern generated from production of organobromine products studied.

2. Waste Management Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The largest volume wastes generated by the organobromines industry are wastewaters disposed by injection into underground
deep wells regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control (UIC) program (40 CFR parts
144&hyph;148). Some of the combined waste streams being deep well-injected are classified as hazardous wastes under
40 CFR part 261. As a result, the industry must comply with applicable regulations under the Land Disposal Restrictions
(LDR) program in 40 CFR part 268, which require that hazardous wastes may not be land-disposed without treatment to
specified levels or by specified methods. Disposal by underground injection is included in the definition of ``land
disposal'' in 40 CFR 268.2. Specific restrictions on the underground injection of hazardous wastes are codified
in 40 CFR part 148. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the two major production plants submitted a petition under 40 CFR 148.20 for an exemption from these LDR requirements
for the disposal of wastes in wells located at its plant. They provided site-specific information to demonstrate
that there would be no migration of the injected wastes to an underground source of drinking water for as long as the
wastes remain hazardous (40 CFR 148.20). Their demonstration showed that the geological and geochemical conditions
at the site and the physicochemical nature of the wastestreams were such that the hazardous constituents in the fluids
will not migrate within 10,000 years vertically or laterally. The petition was approved by the Agency and the exemption
was granted. EPA expects the facility to continue this form of disposal at the same level in the future regardless of
this listing determination because of economic considerations. As a result, EPA believes that wastes being disposed
by underground injection at this plant will not pose a risk to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation with respect to the second major facility is different. This facility consists of several plants located
a few miles apart. Each plant has its own set of injection wells. One plant, which according to the Agency's information
generates listed hazardous wastewater, has two wells into which listed hazardous waste is currently injected. Another,
which according to the Agency's information does not produce a listed wastewater, has at least three wells which do
not accept hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the wells at this facility have an approved no-migration petition. Therefore, for currently listed wastewaters,
the facility will have to consider waste treatment prior to disposal. An option under consideration by the plant is
the construction of a wastewater treatment plant to treat the wastewaters prior to either release to surface waters
or deep well injection. The facility is not likely to want to abandon the use of deep well injection for economic reasons.
Shipment of wastewaters off site would be economically prohibitive given the large wastewaters volumes involved.
For unlisted wastewaters, the most plausible management scenario would be continued deep well injection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that it would be unlikely that the facility would attempt to store wastewater in lagoons. The area
has a moist climate, so evaporation is not a viable option. The plant is currently under several consent agreements
to remove contamination resulting from the previous use of unlined lagoons for temporary wastewater storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency selected the plausible mismanagement scenario for modeling purposes for unlisted wastewaters
to be the current practice of underground injection for this plant's wastewaters. EPA has no information or reason
to believe that, if not listed, the wastewaters would be managed in a different manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to underground injection, certain other waste management practices commonly used in the organobromine
chemicals industry are regulated by specific RCRA regulations. Both major plants use Bromine Recovery Units (BRUs)
to recover bromine values from organic liquid and vapor waste streams. In these units, the organics are burned and
the combustion products are removed by a wet scrubber. The BRUs are halogen acid furnaces (HAFs), which meet the regulatory
definition of industrial furnace in 40 CFR 260.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combustion of hazardous waste in industrial furnaces is regulated under 40 CFR part 266, subpart H which regulate
air emissions from these units and require monitoring and analyses. These regulations impose emissions standards
and air quality limits for the BRUs, which are designed to control and reduce the level of risk posed by this management
practice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 CFR 266.104(e) establishes controls for dioxin- and furan-containing wastes). Both major plants burn listed
spent solvents and still bottoms in these units; therefore, they are already subject to the performance standards
of part 266, subpart H. EPA believes that residuals managed in this manner and in compliance with applicable regulations
do not pose any additional risk to human health and the environment because the facilities are currently in compliance
with their permits to operate these units. EPA has not found any compelling evidence indicating that the major plants
would manage these wastes in any other way. These recovery units are integrated into the major plants and abandoning
their use would require considerable plant modifications to be made with no economic benefit to the facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The solid residuals generated in organobromine chemicals production are currently being shipped off site to commercial
Subtitle D landfills and to Subtitle C disposal facilities, even though some of these residuals are not regulated
as hazardous wastes. Other wastes (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spent adsorbents, filter cakes, and floor sweepings) are being incinerated. At the smaller firms production contracts
specify that wastes be shipped to incinerators operated by the pharmaceutical industry in order to minimize future
potential liability. The most plausible mismanagement scenario for solids is placement in unlined Subtitle D landfills.
The plants currently are not required to send unregulated wastes to Subtitle C facilities. Because of the lower cost
and wider availability of Subtitle D facilities, the Agency feels that this is the most reasonable mismanagement
scenario.

1. Toxicological Information_Use of Structural Activity Relationships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While many chlorinated organic compounds are used widely and have been studied in great detail, their brominated
analogs are more specialized and have not been investigated in the same detail. EPA has found that no reliable health
effects data directly showing significant subchronic toxicity are available for a few of the compounds identified
in the record samples from this industry. For the constituents of concern, validated health effects data, directly
showing subchronic toxicity, are not available for four compounds: ethyl bromide, tetrabromobisphenol-A, tribromophenol,
and the brominated dibenzofurans. Because of the lack of data on these compounds, the Agency explored the use of structure
activity relationships to develop toxicological values for these compounds. Structure activity relationships
involve the use of health effects information for a compound with a very similar chemical structure and properties
to that of the chemical of concern. The Agency determined that this technique could be used for 2,4,6-tribromophenol
and for brominated dibenzofurans because the chemical behavior and mechanism of action for these compounds is expected
to be similar to their chlorinated analogues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ethyl bromide and tetrabromobisphenol-A, this technique could not be used because suitable surrogate compounds,
for which data exist, could not be found. No toxicological data exist for other halogenated derivatives of bisphenol
A, and ethyl bromide differs from its chlorinated congeners with respect to its ability to undergo hydrolysis and
other important reactions. The basis for the listing determinations for the wastes with these two compounds is discussed
later in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the present time, inadequate toxicity data have prevented EPA from establishing a verified or unverified human
health reference value for 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP). The structures of TBP and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP)
are sufficiently similar to be considered halogenated congeners of phenol, and their toxicities are explainable
in terms of identified molecular mechanisms. The relative quantitative activities of halogenated phenol congeners
such as TBP and TCP are derived from the ease of formation and reaction of these compounds and their metabolites. Both
halogenated phenols contain three symmetrically placed bromine or chlorine substituents which are difficult to
remove by chemical substitution. The presence of difficult-to-remove substituents at the ortho and para positions
inhibits oxidative decomposition of these moieties via formation of cyclic ketone intermediates. EPA has used this
information to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for TBP. The critical endpoint
of concern for TCP and TBP is carcinogenicity. The Agency has determined that, based on QSAR analysis, the long-term
toxicity of TBP and TCP are essentially the same. For today's proposal, the Agency has estimated the cancer slope factor
for TBP to be the same as TCP, or 1.1 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, data on TBP analyzed by EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics indicated a ``low to moderate''
concern for oncogenicity, mutagenicity, liver and kidney toxicity, developmental, and reproductive toxicity.
The Agency's QSAR analysis reports for TBP are available in the docket of today's proposal. See

 section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to dibenzofurans, quantitative data comparing the potency of brominated dioxins and furans to their
chlorinated counterparts are also relatively sparse. Consensus among most of the studies supports the view that
brominated analogs are less potent than the chlorinated dioxins and furans, although several studies suggest that
the groups are equipotent when considered on a molar basis. EPA estimated a potency factor of 0.3 for 2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TBDD) relative to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). This report is available in the docket. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section. However, application of the toxicity equivalency factor (TEF) methodology to all of the BDFs is not currently
possible because of the lack of research data. EPA conducted an analysis assuming 30&hyph;100% toxicity for the brominated
furans as compared to the chlorinated ones and used the 100 percent value for making risk-based decisions. EPA believes
this is a conservative approach that will ensure protection of human health and the environment. The Agency requests
comment on this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all other compounds, the Agency is basing its determination of whether to list on constituents for which adequate
health effects data exist. (For a complete listing of the constituents identified in the samples of wastes from the
production of chemicals listed in the EDF consent decree and their concentrations, see the Background Document for
this proposed listing determination, available in the RCRA public docket.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, published health-based data exist for all but four of the waste constituents of concern. Inadequate data
exist for tetrabromobisphenol-A, ethyl bromide, the brominated dibenzofurans and tribromophenol. Structure
activity-derived health-based information is available and was used for the brominated dibenzofurans and tribromophenol.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) have been used in other ways in other EPA programs. For example,
EPA uses QSARs in evaluating premanufacturing notice data submitted by industry under TSCA. The Agency may require
additional testing of the chemical being reviewed based on a QSAR analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this is the first time the Agency is basing a listing determination for a wastestream on QSAR analysis. The
prospect of using QSARs to identify wastes for regulation holds significant promise for the Agency. It is one way to
evaluate some potentially hazardous constituents without requiring expensive and time-consuming toxicity testing.
However, the Agency recognizes that the approach could result in additional regulatory effects on some waste generators,
local governments, or other federal agencies. In addition, the use of QSARs in listing determinations could have
broad policy implications for EPA. Therefore, the Agency solicits comment on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Under what conditions is the use of QSAR valid in making hazardous waste listing determinations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is there another way to characterize the risk potential of wastestreams for which there is a lack of toxicity data
on the sole or the primary constituent in the wastestream? (Note that limited resources may restrict the ability of
the Agency to conduct testing of the compounds involved).

2. Plausible Mismanagement Scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency developed baseline risk estimates by selecting plausible mismanagement practices based on information
collected in the RCRA Section 3007 survey for current management operations. For wastewaters, the Agency selected
the plausible mismanagement practice to be the current practice of deep well injection. The Agency has no information
or reason to believe that, if not listed, the wastewaters are likely to be managed in a different manner, except if pretreatment
of wastewaters is required prior to injection. For sludges and waste solids, the Agency selected the plausible mismanagement
to be an unlined landfill. Currently, a portion of the waste goes to a lined Subtitle D landfill. In addition, the Agency
has information that a portion of these wastes, while not regulated as hazardous, are managed as hazardous with disposal
in Subtitle C landfills. However, the Agency lacks adequate information showing that, if not listed as hazardous,
the wastes would continue to be disposed in lined landfills and result in significantly lower estimates of potential
risk. The Agency requests comment on this approach to modelling plausible mismanagement practices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Risk characterization approach.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and
Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments
will be expected to address or provide descriptions of: (1) Individual risk to include the central tendency and high-end
portions of the risk distribution, (2) important subgroups of the population such as highly exposed or highly susceptible
groups or individuals, if known, and (3) population risk. In addition to the presentation of results, the guidance
also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures with an open discussion
of uncertainties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual risk.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified
population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population,
the risk levels of various groups within the population, and the average risk for individuals within a population
of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying
and describing the population of concern for an exposure route; (2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters
used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters
in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating risk for an exposure pathway that provides a characterization
of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Population risk.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Descriptors of population risk are intended to convey information about the risk borne by the population or population
segment being studied. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the number of cases of a particular
health effect that probabilistically could occur within the population during a given time period, the number of
persons or percent of the population above a certain risk level or health benchmark (e.g., RfD or RfC), and risk for
a particular population segment.

Risk assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The analysis of risks was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the
modelling of waste mismanagement scenarios. Specifically, for disposal of solids in unlined landfills, the concentration
of the constituents of concern in the landfill leachate first was determined using the Toxicity Characteristics
Leaching Procedure (TCLP) on selected record samples, or when TCLP data were lacking, by assuming a leachate concentration
based on the aqueous solubility of the constituent. It then was assumed that the leachate would be diluted by a factor
of 100 (as described in the Toxicity Characteristic Rule 55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990) before reaching the nearest drinking
water well. The resulting diluted concentrations can be then compared with the health-based values. In the case of
this analysis, a one-in-a-million (10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) risk level or hazard quotient of 1 was used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For wastewaters, the situation was more complicated. One facility has been granted a no-migration variance from
the land disposal restrictions. The second facility, which consists of several separate plants, has not obtained
such a variance. The plants at the second facility currently dispose of process wastewaters by deep well injection.
Modelling for specific wastewater streams was based on the possibilities of leakage of injected wastewaters from
the injection zone upward to a drinking water aquifer through the abandoned oil and gas wells in the area. Details of
this modelling are given in the Risk Modelling Background Document and summarized in the individual wastewater risk
assessment to be discussed in the following sections.

Wastes From Production of Bromochloromethane/Dibromomethane
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_i. Solids. Dibromomethane is a low-volume product with limited commercial applications; therefore, it is unlikely
that other firms will enter the marketplace. The only solid wastes generated from the production of dibromomethane
are spent filters used to remove rust and other particulate matter from the product. About two drums of the material
are generated per year. As a result, the Agency feels the quantity is de minimis. The filters are changed yearly and
the spent filter material is sent to a Subtitle C incinerator. The waste is generated in small quantities and is mixed
with other halogenated solids prior to incineration at the Subtitle C facility. As a result, the Agency believes that
although the waste generated from the production of dibromomethane contains toxic constituents, it does not pose
a threat to human health and the environment because of the small quantities generated and current management practices.
The Agency is proposing a no-list decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ii. Wastewaters. Dibromomethane and bromochloromethane are manufactured as co-products at only one facility in
the U.S., which has an approved no-migration petition for its deep well injection unit. The approved petition means
that the waste will not migrate from the formation into which it is being injected and will therefore not pose risk sufficient
to warrant listing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wastes From the Production of Ethyl Bromide_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
i. Solids. Ethyl bromide is manufactured in low volumes at only one facility. The only solid waste stream consists
of spent filter materials used to remove impurities from the product. This waste contains about 90,000 parts per million
ethyl bromide and is generated in quantities of 6 drums per year which is sent to Subtitle C facilities for treatment
and disposal. High dilution with other wastes placed in the landfill would reduce leachate concentration levels
to below those for reasonable concern. The Agency feels that although the waste does contain toxic constituents,
based on the production history of this chemical, it is unlikely that other firms will enter the market and that, because
of the minimal waste quantities generated and the current waste management practice, there is no need for a specific
listing of the filters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Wastewaters. The wastewater stream is condensate water containing only small amounts of ethanol as a contaminant.
This wastestream contains no other contaminants of concern and is managed by deepwell injection. Prior to injection,
the ethanol-containing stream is mixed with wastewaters from other processes and the resulting mixed stream thus
is diluted by a factor of over 1,000. As a result, the Agency believes that the ethanol content of the combined stream
poses little to no risk to human health or the environment, and proposes not to list this wastestream.

Wastes From the Production of Tetrabromobisphenol-A_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
i. Solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The solid wastes generated from the tetrabromobisphenol A process consist of spilled product and floor sweepings
from the production area. This material currently is managed in Subtitle C facilities. About 150 tons of this waste
are generated annually. Bisphenol-A is manufactured by condensation of phenol and acetone. As a result, commercial
grade bisphenol-A may contain variable low levels of phenol and, therefore, the brominated material is expected
to contain some brominated phenols. Some of these will co-precipitate with the product during the process and be incorporated
into the solid product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the Agency has insufficient information to characterize the amount of the brominated phenols (including
tetrabromobisphenol-A) in the product or their leachability from the product matrix. EPA requests any information
on the amount of brominated phenols in the product and their leachability from the product matrix. At this time, the
Agency also does not have information on the toxicity of tetrabromobisphenol A, and requests any information commenters
may have on its toxicology, including the existence of any toxicological analogues for tetrabromobisphenol A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Record sampling of an on-site landfill at one plant where these solids were formerly disposed for a number of years
showed the absence of any brominated materials in the landfill leachate. Given the lack of adequate information to
perform a risk analysis at this time, the Agency is concerned about being conclusive about the potential hazard of
this waste stream and its potential to migrate to ground water if managed in an unlined landfill. The Agency proposes
to defer for this waste stream a listing determination and requests submission of both characterization and toxicological
data, if available. EPA will evaluate carefully all public comments and information received in response to this
notice. Particular attention will be paid to any data submitted which tend to either support or refute a finding of
risk to human health and the environment from wastes from the production of tetrabromobisphenol A. Based on comments
received, including any data, EPA may choose, rather than deferring, to promulgate a final determination to either
list or not list tetrabromobisphenol A waste as a hazardous waste under RCRA.

ii. Wastewaters. Wastewaters from the manufacture of tetrabromobisphenol A are already listed and carry the hazardous
waste code of K131. Methyl bromide and tetrabromobisphenol A are produced in the same process. Process wastewater
originates from the distillation step where methyl bromide is recovered. The Agency feels that no further action
is needed for the waste stream.

Wastes From the Production of Octabromodiphenyl Oxide._

i. Solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solid wastes such as filter cakes typically are disposed of in landfills. This has been the practice of the major organobromine
chemicals manufacturers for many years. Currently, these wastes are being shipped to Subtitle C hazardous waste
facilities. However, it would be possible for the generators to change their disposal practices and direct these
materials to Subtitle D landfills. The quantities of these wastes generated are not de minimis as was the case for dibromomethane
solid wastes. Toluene is present in filter cakes from the production of octabromodiphenyl oxide. To evaluate the
potential risks associated with filter cake containing toluene, EPA applied the Agency's Organic Leachate Model
(51 FR 27062, April 29, 1986) to estimate the maximum amounts of toluene that would be expected to leach from the filter
cake in an open landfill environment. The Agency also sampled the on-site landfill at one production site where some
of this waste was disposed. The sampling of the landfill leachate did not detect any toluene present. The toluene concentrations
in the filter cake were used as input to the Agency's Composite Model for Landfills (56 FR 32993, July 18, 1991) to estimate
high-end (95th percentile) concentrations of toluene in a hypothetical receptor well. The hypothetical well concentrations
derived from this analysis are about one order of magnitude below the Maximum Concentration Level (MCL) for toluene
promulgated by regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The formulae used and a more detailed discussion of the
application of these models to the waste samples can be found in the Background Document, available in the RCRA public
docket. See

 section. Because the modelled leachate levels are below acceptable drinking water levels, EPA does not believe that
toluene-containing filter cake wastes generated in the production of octabromodiphenyl oxide pose a threat to human
health and the environment; thus, the Agency proposes not to list this wastestream. The waste solids also contained
about 4.4 ppb of brominated dibenzofurans (most of which were the hepta isomer), which the Agency believes are among
the least toxic of the brominated dibenzofurans. The toxicities of these materials were evaluated in terms of equivalence
to that for tetrachlorodibenzo-dioxin (TCDD). The Agency has concluded that the risk posed by this constituent is
below the 10

Also, the health-based for a one-in-a-million risk level for octabromodiphenyl oxide using standard intake and
exposure assumptions is 0.1 mg/L. No leachate data are available for this waste. However, the Agency assumed an upper-bound
leachate concentration of 0.2 mg/L based on the solubility of octabromodiphenyl oxide. Assuming a dilution factor
of 100 is achievable during migration to the nearest drinking water well, the concentration in potable water would
be below that of concern. As a result, EPA is proposing not to list this waste stream based on low estimated exposure
to toxic constituents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Wastewaters. While the Agency has no quantifiable concentration data on octabromodiphenyl oxide found in the
wastewaters, adequate data exist on brominated dibenzofurans found in the generated wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brominated dibenzofurans were detected in some of the record samples from octa- and decabromodiphenyl oxide processes.
Studies conducted for EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics and by research groups in Germany and the Netherlands
show that brominated furans can be formed during the manufacture of brominated diphenyl ethers, as well as during
their fabrication into polymers. The evidence currently available to the Agency indicates that brominated dioxins
and furans may range from 30&hyph;100% as toxic as their chlorinated counterparts. Using this approach, a record
sample of wastewater from the octabromodiphenyl oxide unit showed a maximum toxicity equivalent of 3.7&times;10

level would be below the MCL for 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD, which is 3&times;10

 mg/L. The Agency selected the highest toxicity value in making this analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evaluation, the Agency is proposing not to list this waste stream for brominated dibenzofurans, because
EPA believes that estimated exposure levels to toxic constituents are sufficiently low so as to not pose a threat to
human health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency was unable to quantify levels of octabromodiphenyl oxide present in wastewaters. However, the solubility
of the chemical is only 0.2 mg/L. The flow of wastewaters from this process represents less than one percent of the total
amount of process wastewater injected. The health-based level for a one-in-a-million risk level for octabromodiphenyl
is 0.1 mg/L. Due to the high level of dilution occurring prior to injection, the resulting concentration of the toxic
chemical expected to reach drinking water aquifers is well below levels of concern.

Wastes From the Production of Decabromodiphenyl Oxide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_i. Solids. The production of decabromodiphenyl oxide generates solid wastes consisting of collected spilled product.
Only limited analytical results were obtained from the record sampling of this waste and no TCLP leachate data were
obtained for this compound. However, the Agency assumed an upper-bound leachate concentration of 0.2 mg/L based
on the aqueous solubility of the constituent. The health-based level for a one-in-a-million risk level for this compound
is 0.35 mg/L, (assuming exposure of drinking 2.0 L/day for a 70 year exposure period) so the concentration in the leachate
is already below the level of concern before any further dilution. Therefore, the Agency is proposing not to list this
wastestream.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Wastewaters. The manufacture of decabromodiphenyl oxide also generates a wastewater stream. The Agency was
unable to quantify the amount of the product in the wastewater stream. Based on the process chemistry, however, a small
amount of product would appear in the stream. The solubility of decabromodiphenyl oxide is less than 0.2 mg/L. This
chemical has a health-based level of 0.35 mg/L so the leachate concentration is already below the level of concern
even before the subsequent significant dilution occurs. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to not list this wastestream.

Wastes From the Production of Tribromophenol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_i. Solids. Solids from the production of tribromophenol (TBP) consist of spilled materials, off-specification
product and spent filter cartridges which were used to remove entrained TBP particulates from the gaseous hydrogen
bromide coproduct. The one plant manufacturing this chemical mixes the three wastes together prior to shipment off
site for land disposal. Most of this waste is sent to a Subtitle C hazardous waste facility. However, some is being sent
to a Subtitle D landfill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inadequate toxicity data for tribromophenol (TBP) have prevented the Agency from establishing a human health reference
value for tribromophenol (TBP). Therefore, as previously discussed, the Agency performed a structure activity
relationship (SAR) analysis in order to provide a provisional human health reference value for this compound.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the structure activity relationship, the health-based level for a one-in-a-million risk level for TBP should
be the same as that for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 0.003 mg/L assuming exposure of drinking 2.0 liters per day for a 70-year exposure period). The health-based level
of 0.003 mg/L can be considered a bounding estimate which could overestimate the exposure in an actual population.
TCLP leaching data presented in the Industry Study Background Document show concentrations of 760 and 16 mg/L of TBP
in leachate extracts from the off-specification product and the filter cartridges, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the leachate levels exceed the health-based levels for this wastestream, the Agency conducted an analysis
of the potential risk from unlined landfill disposal. For this analysis, the Agency selected what are perhaps conservative
dilution factors and exposure assumptions. Using a dilution and attenuation factor of 100 from the Toxicity Characteristic
rule (55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990) to simulate the subsurface dilution of the leachate concentration between an unlined
landfill and a hypothetical receptor well, the estimated TBP concentrations in groundwater are 7.6 and 0.16 mg/L,
respectively. Assuming that people drinking from this hypothetical well are exposed to the contaminant by drinking
1.4 L/day of contaminated water every day over a 30-year interval, the health-based limit of a one-in-a-million increased
lifetime risk of cancer is 0.01 mg/L. Thus, the levels of estimated individual risk from exposure to TBP in groundwater
are 7&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 2&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this proposed rule, the Agency did not conduct a more sophisticated risk analysis. A more sophisticated risk assessment
may suggest different estimated risks than the analysis described above. For example, the dilution factor of 100
was derived assuming that the chemical does not adsorb or degrade in the subsurface environment. The Agency is aware
that the fate and transport of TBP in the environment is dependent on the environment in which the waste is disposed.
If disposal is to a neutral or slightly acidic environment, the octanol-water coefficient (a constant often related
to the soil-water adsorption coefficient) for TBP is relatively high, exceeding 16,000. This value suggests that
TBP in landfill leachate may bind to subsurface soils and may migrate at low concentrations over a very long period
of time in some environments. On the other hand, disposal under alkaline conditions, which are present in areas where
organobromines are produced, would likely result in less sorption to subsurface soils. This suggests that TBP could
become more mobile under these conditions. In addition, the dilution factor of 100 in the analysis used corresponds
to the dilution factor expected at a drinking water well 500 feet downgradient from the disposal location. The Agency
does not know the distance between landfills or disposal areas that could receive TBP wastes and the nearby downgradient
drinking water wells or intercept surface waters. Depending on the distance to the nearest well or environmental
receptor, the actual human health and environmental risks could be substantially greater than or less than those
estimated in the analysis employed in this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more sophisticated analysis would also consider other potential exposure pathways in addition to consumption
of contaminated groundwater. For example, since TBP under some soil pH's is likely to bind strongly to particulates
such as soil, the Agency is concerned that disposal of these wastes could result in soil contamination around the disposal
site and human health and environmental risks. The concentration of 2,4,6 TBP in the floor sweepings was very high
(up to 400,000 ppm) in the two samples the Agency measured. Since the wastes are in dry, powdery form, they could be dispersed
around the disposal facility. Depending on the disposal rate and the likelihood of exposure, exposure to particulates
at the disposal site could pose human health and environmental risks at levels of concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on the risk analysis used in this proposal and plausible mismanagement practices of TBP
wastes. EPA requests comment on the issues raised above and on all aspects of the risk analysis employed. In particular,
the Agency requests comment on the use of the DAF of 100 for this specific analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposal in a Subtitle D landfill is the most plausible mismanagement scenario, given the lower cost for disposal
at such sites. The model previously discussed assumes that the Subtitle D facility is unlined. Because the concentrations
of TBP at a receptor well could exceed health-based levels, the Agency is proposing to list the solids from the production
of tribromophenol as hazardous wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is seeking comment on the risk levels used in this risk assessment. In the Superfund program, EPA makes clean
up decisions using concentration levels that represent excess upper bound lifetime cancer risk to an individual
of between 10

Based on the analysis used, EPA is proposing to add tribromophenol to the list of 40 CFR Part 261 Appendix VIII toxic
hazardous constituents based on its structural activity relationship with 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and the potential
exposure as described above. The Agency also is proposing to add tribromophenol to the list of commercial chemical
products (40 CFR 261.33) that are hazardous wastes if discarded or spilled. The wastes specifically proposed for
listing are:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will evaluate carefully all public comments and information received in response to this notice, particularly
data which tend to support or refute a finding of risk to human health and the environment from TBP wastes. Based on the
comments received, the Agency may finalize or re-evaluate today's proposed listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Wastewaters. Data available to the Agency suggests that tribromophenol is produced only at the part of the one
major facility in which the wastewaters are injected into non-hazardous deep wells. As off-site management of these
wastewaters is probably economically prohibitive, the Agency assumed for the plausible mismanagement scenario
that the plant would continue the use of underground injection. In order to estimate risk, EPA had to estimate the length
of time injection would continue. The Agency assumed that the plant would inject these wastewaters for up to 60 years,
at which point the production of tribromophenol could end because the supply of raw material could run out. Because
of the large volume of wastewater generated by this process, the Agency used more sophisticated modelling than for
the lower volume wastes. Modelling of the risk due to the management of the wastewaters from TBP production in underground
injection was based on the use of three linked submodels. The overall model included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A submodel which simulates the subsurface lateral migration of TBP from the injection wells to nearby abandoned
oil wells penetrating the injection horizons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A second submodel which simulates the vertical migration of TBP from the injection horizon upward to the drinking
water aquifer; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Finally, a submodel which predicts the lateral spreading of the chemical from the abandoned oil well in the drinking
water aquifer and exposure to vertically averaged concentrations present in drinking water wells within the aquifer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was assumed that the abandoned wells are filled with compacted sand. Results of the simulated runs are presented
in the background document in terms of concentrations as a function of time for various exposure distances. The initial
concentration of tribromophenol in the injected wastewater was measured in record sampling to be 7 mg/L and the health-based
level (based on a 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk level) was assumed to be 0.01 mg/L (using the same high end exposure assumptions described above for tribromophenol
solids). The modeling results showed that the health-based level (based on a 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk) would be exceeded in the upper aquifer after 60 years (the amount of time the injection is expected to continue)
at very short distances (less than 10 feet) from a leaking, abandoned, and plugged (i.e., filled with sand) oil well.
The results also indicated that the plume of contamination would migrate through the aquifer, away from the plugged
oil well, and slowly dissipate over time. Therefore, this plume of contamination could result in exposure to TBP over
the health-based level beyond a short distance from the abandoned oil well, if a drinking water well is drilled downgradient
from that abandoned oil well. However, this exposure would probably be limited because of the relatively small size
of the area in the migrating contaminated plume where TBP is above 0.01 mg/L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has also sampled drinking water wells at the plant site and at a private facility 1.3 miles distant. No tribromophenol
was found at a detection level of 0.001 mg/L. The plant has been producing TBP since 1976. The absence of TBP in groundwater
at present, however, does not completely preclude its presence at a future date. Considering that TBP was not detected
in the aquifer and that the model predicted only limited exposure to TBP above the health-based number, the Agency
is proposing not to list this wastestream because of relatively low risk to human health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency recognizes that the modeling results described above are dependent on numerous assumptions,
including the injection timeframe (i.e., 60 years) and the number and characteristics of the abandoned oil wells.
Modifying certain of these assumptions could significantly change the results of this analysis. For example, if
the Agency assumes that the abandoned oil well is unfilled, underground injection of this wastewater could result
in a contamination plume (with TBP levels above the health-based level) of up to 4000 feet from the well over 60 years
and even further away as the plume continues to migrate after 60 years. Also, depending on the exact location of the
drinking water well relative to the plume centerline, a person drinking from that well could be exposed to a high concentration
of TBP (up to around 5 mg/L) for many years as the contaminated plume moves by.

Therefore, the Agency solicits comment on the assumptions used in this modeling, particularly whether or not some
of them should be changed to more accurately predict the risk resulting from the undergound injection of these wastewaters.
The Agency specifically requests comment on the following assumptions that are particularly important in this analysis:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The model assumed that only one abandoned well would be open to flow. Should the Agency consider the potential for

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

that no breaks have occurred or will occur in the aquifer in any of the many abandoned wells in the area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The drinking water well was assumed to be drilled in the proximity of an abandoned oil well. Is this a valid assumption?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The model assumed an average concentration of tribromophenol in the Sparta aquifer. If the well tapping the drinking
water is nearer to the top of the aquifer, as it most likely would be, would this make a significant difference in the
risk level calculated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Agency assumed that injection of wastewaters and pumping from Sparta at the site occurs during the same time
frame. Should the Agency consider the pumping from Sparta will continue to occur after injection of wastewater ceases,
which could affect the modelling calculation?

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Agency requests comment on whether or not these tribromophenol wastewaters should be listed as hazardous
waste based on modifications to EPA's analysis or on any additional data indicating groundwater contamination from
the underground injection of these wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although today's proposed listing determination models potential contamination to a drinking water source, it
is not a finding under Section 144.12 of the UIC regulations. Those regulations prohibit endangerment of underground
sources of drinking water (USDWs) as defined under the UIC program. A well which fails to meet this requirement must
be denied a permit or placed under an enforcement action. The threshold for a determination of compliance with Section
144.12 is different from the threshold for listing a waste as hazardous under RCRA. The test for compliance under the
UIC program is whether the well may cause the movement of any contaminant into a USDW in a manner that may cause a violation
of a primary drinking water regulation, or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.

2. Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to list as hazardous waste solids and spent filters from the production of 2,4,6-tribromophenol
(K140) and the off-specification and discarded product (U408) based on their projected toxicities from structural
activity studies, and potential exposure to these chemicals. EPA's decision to propose these additional hazardous
waste listings represents a determination by the Agency that the wastes identified meet the criteria for listing
as hazardous wastes presented in 40 CFR 261.11. Specifically, based on available evidence, the Agency concludes
that 2,4,6-tribromophenol is similar in toxicity to its chlorinated analogue. EPA is proposing that these wastes
from organobromines production be listed as hazardous and subject to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 124, 262&hyph;266,
268, 270, and 271 since they are capable of posing a threat to human health and the environment when improperly treated,
stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise handled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the data collected by the Agency during the recent organobromines industry study and the unique conditions
of the industry regarding limitations to future expansion, EPA believes there is justification for a no-list determination
for wastes generated from the production of most of the other organobromine chemicals identified in the consent decree
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bromochloromethane, ethyl bromide, octabromodiphenyl oxide and decabromodiphenyl oxide) and for the wastewaters
from tribromophenol production. After considering the collected information and data from toxicological, chemical,
hydrogeological, and engineering viewpoints, EPA has concluded that the disposal of any wastes from these processes
that are not currently listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D do not pose a substantial present or future risk to human health
and the environment. Therefore, at this time, EPA is proposing not to list as hazardous wastes any additional wastes
generated from the production of these chemicals. The Agency reserves the right to revisit these listing determinations
if additional relevant data become available. In addition, the Agency is deferring action on the solids waste stream
from the production of tetrabromobisphenol-A.

III. Waste Minimization Opportunities in the Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the industry study, the Agency identified two potential opportunities for waste minimization. The first
involves the recovery of tribromophenol in the tetrabromobisphenol-A and tribromophenol process. Commercial
bisphenol A is made by condensation of phenol and acetone and, hence, the feedstock contains some unreacted phenol.
Record sampling of one wastewater stream that leaves the process hot revealed that it contained up to 15,000 mg/L of
tribromophenol. A second unrelated wastewater stream from the production of tribromophenol also contains about
70 ppm. This chemical has a solubility of 70 parts per million at 25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. From the volumes of wastewater generated, the Agency believes that enough material potentially could be
recovered to increase annual production of tribromophenol by up to 70%. Cooling and filtering of this wastewater
prior to deep well disposal might recover phenolics, limit the quantity of brominated chemicals being disposed,
and reduce the plant's overall requirements for purchased phenol. Brominated phenol recovery also could make recycling
some process wastewater viable, particularly in the tribromophenol process where the wastewater containing chiefly
this material is disposed of by deep well injection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second area where savings could be achieved is in product packaging. Materials spilled in the packaging areas
are drummed and shipped to Subtitle C facilities. Presently, the two major manufacturers of organobromine chemicals
generate over 300 tons per year of various spilled solid products. Recovery of this material could result in significant
savings and benefit the environment. The Agency invites comment on both waste minimization options.

IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis and Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Regulatory Impact Analysis Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order No. 12866 requires that a regulatory agency determine whether a new regulation will have ``significant
regulatory action'' and, if so, that a cost-benefit analysis be conducted. This analysis is a quantification of the
potential benefits, costs, and economic impacts of a rule. A significant regulatory action is defined as a regulation
that has an annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more that adversely affects in a material way the economy, a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local,
or Tribal governments or communities; creates a serious inconsistency with actions taken or planned by another agency;
materially alters the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities,
or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency estimated the costs of today's proposed rule to determine if it is a significant regulation as defined by
Executive Order 12866. Today's proposed rule is estimated to have an annualized incremental cost of less than $100,000.
Based on this compliance cost estimate, today's proposed rule is not considered to be a significant regulatory action.
This section of the preamble discusses the results of the analyses of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To estimate the costs, economic impacts, and benefits of today's proposed rule, the Agency compared post-regulatory
costs, benefits, and economic impacts with those resulting under baseline conditions. Benefits are addressed in
the risk assessment section of this preamble. The baseline management practices for this waste is disposal in a Subtitle
D landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the extremely small universe of facilities potentially affected by this rule, the number of facilities actually
affected is insignificant. The requirements promulgated by this proposed rule are estimated to cost industry less
than $100,000 per year assuming disposal in a Subtitle C landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact analysis estimates that none of the affected facilities would be significantly affected by the
proposed rule. Compliance with this proposed rule is estimated to increase operating expenses at affected facilities
by significantly less than one percent. None of the affected facilities is expected to close as a result of the rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, whenever an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes the effect of the rule on small entities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary,
however, if the rule is estimated not to have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to EPA's guidelines for conducting an RFA, if over 20 percent of the population of small entities is likely
to experience financial distress based on the costs of the rule, then the Agency considers that the rule will have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and must perform an RFA. EPA evaluated the economic
effect of the proposed rule, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and determined that no facilities would
be significantly affected. The Administrator certifies that part 268 and part 148 will not have significant economic
effects on a substantial number of small entities. As a result of this finding, the Agency has not prepared a formal
RFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule does not contain any new information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The information collection requirements in this proposal were promulgated in previous land disposal restriction
rulemakings and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Since there are no new information collection
requirements being proposed today, an Information Collection Request has not been prepared. However, facilities
will have to comply with existing Subtitle C recordkeeping and reporting requirements for newly listed wastestreams
if today's proposals are finalized.

VI. State Program Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Applicability of Rules in States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce RCRA programs within the
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization EPA retains
enforcement authority under Sections 3008, 7003, and 3013 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement
responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a State with final RCRA authorization administered
its authorized hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the
authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities in the State which the State was authorized to
permit. When new, more-stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obliged to enact
equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized
State until the State adopted the requirements as State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, under Section 3006(g) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the
HSWA take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in unauthorized States. EPA is directed
to implement these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until
the State modifies its program to reflect the Federal standards, and applies for and is granted authorization. While
States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized
States in the interim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal for listing EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. K140 and U408 is being proposed pursuant to Section 3001(e)(2)
of RCRA, a provision added by HSWA. When the final rules are promulgated, EPA will consider its HSWA obligation to make
a determination regarding listing organobromine wastes to be fulfilled. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to add
these requirements to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal program requirements that are promulgated
pursuant to HSWA and that take effect in all States, regardless of their authorization status. States may apply for
final authorization for the HSWA provisions identified in 40 CFR 271.1(j) Table 1, as discussed in the following section
of the preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Effect on State Authorizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted previously, today's rule is being proposed pursuant to provisions added by HSWA. The addition of K140 to the
list of hazardous wastes from specific sources and the addition of U408 to the list of commercial chemical products
that are hazardous when discarded is proposed pursuant to Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA, a provision added by the HSWA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, EPA will implement the HSWA portions of today's rule (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the addition of K140 to the list of hazardous wastes from specific sources and the addition of U408 to the list of commercial
chemical products that are hazardous when discarded) in authorized States until they modify their programs to adopt
these rules and such modifications are approved by EPA. Because this rule will be promulgated pursuant to HSWA, a State
submitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim or final RCRA authorization under Section
3006 (b) and (g) on the basis that State regulations are substantially equivalent or fully equivalent to EPA's regulations.
The procedures and schedule for State programs modifications for either interim or final authorization are described
in 40 CFR 271.21. It should be noted that all HSWA interim authorizations will expire on January 1, 2003 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c)),
52 FR 60129, December 18, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that 40 CFR 271.21(e) requires that States having final RCRA authorization must modify their programs
to reflect Federal program changes and subsequently must submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadline
by which States must modify their programs to adopt today's proposed rule will be determined by the date of promulgation
of the final rule in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). Once EPA approves the modification, the State requirements
become RCRA Subtitle C requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to those proposed in today's rule. Such
State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether
they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, these State regulations will not be deemed as RCRA requirements until
the State program modification is submitted to EPA and approved. Of course, States with existing regulations may
continue to administer and enforce those regulations as a matter of State law. In addition, in implementing the Federal
program, EPA will work with the States under cooperative agreements to minimize duplication of efforts; in many cases,
EPA will be able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs, rather than take separate actions
under Federal authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that submit their official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date
of EPA's regulations are not required to include regulations equivalent to the EPA regulations in their application.
However, States must modify their programs by the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official
applications for final authorization 12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standards
equivalent to these standards in their application. The requirements States must meet when submitting final authorization
applications are set forth in 40 CFR 271.3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that meets one or more of the characteristics
of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined at 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are hazardous substances under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), pursuant to CERCLA Section
101(14) 42 U.S.C. 9601 (14)(c). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along with their
reportable quantities (RQs). Therefore, in addition to the K140 listing being proposed today for 40 CFR 261.32 and
the U408 listing being proposed for 40 CFR 261.33, entries for K140 and U408 also are being proposed for Table 302.4
of 40 CFR 302.4.

Reporting Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under CERCLA Section 103(a), the person in charge of a vessel or facility from which a hazardous substance has been
released in a quantity that equals or exceeds its RQ must immediately notify the National Response Center of the release
(see 40 CFR part 302).

 In addition to this reporting requirement under CERCLA, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11004, requires owners or operators of certain facilities to report the release of a
CERCLA hazardous substance to State and local authorities. EPCRA Section 304 notification must be given immediately
after the release of an RQ or more to the community emergency coordinator of the local emergency planning committee
for each area likely to be affected by the release, and to the State emergency planning commission of any State likely
to be affected by the release.

Adjustment of RQs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under Section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous wastes newly designated under CERCLA will have a statutory RQ of one
pound unless and until adjusted by regulation. The Agency's methodology for adjusting RQs of individual hazardous
substances begins with an evaluation of the intrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of each
hazardous substance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intrinsic properties examined_called ``primary criteria''_are aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity (oral,
dermal, and inhalation), ignitability, reactivity, chronic toxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Generally,
for each intrinsic property, the Agency ranks hazardous substances on a scale, associating a specific range of values
on each scale with an RQ of 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 5000 pounds. The data for each hazardous substance are evaluated using
various primary criteria; each hazardous substance may receive several tentative RQ values based on its particular
intrinsic properties. The lowest of the tentative RQs becomes the ``primary criteria RQ'' for that substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For more detailed information on this methodology, see the preamble to an RQ adjustment final rule published on August
14, 1989 (54 FR 33426). A different methodology is used to assign adjusted RQs to radionuclides (see 54 FR 22524, May
24, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the primary criteria RQs are assigned, substances are further evaluated for their susceptibility to certain
degradative processes, which are used as secondary adjustment criteria. These natural degradative processes are
biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photolysis (BHP). If a hazardous substance, when released into the environment,
degrades relatively rapidly to a less hazardous form by one or more of the BHP processes, its RQ (as determined by the
primary RQ adjustment criteria) is generally raised one level.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This adjustment is made because the relative potential for harm to public health or welfare or the environment posed
by the release of such a substance is reduced by these degradative processes. Conversely, if a hazardous substance
degrades to a more hazardous product after its release, the original substance is assigned an RQ equal to the RQ for
the more hazardous substance, which may be one or more levels lower than the RQ for the original substance. The downward
adjustment is appropriate because the hazard posed by the release of the original substance is increased as a result
of BHP.

No RQ level increase based on BHP occurs if the primary criteria RQ is already at its highest possible level (100 pounds
for potential carcinogens and 5000 pounds for all other types of hazardous substances except radionuclides). BHP
is not applied to radionuclides.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methodology summarized above is applied to adjust the RQs of individual hazardous substances. An additional
process applies to RCRA listed wastes, which contain individual hazardous substances as constituents. As the Agency
has stated (54 FR 33440, August 14, 1989), to assign an RQ to a RCRA waste, the Agency determines the RQ for each constituent
of the waste and then assigns the lowest of these constituent RQs to the waste itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Adjusted RQs for U408 and K140.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Waste U408 is 2,4,6-tribromophenol, an individual hazardous substance. It has been evaluated for four of the six
primary RQ adjustment criteria_aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity, ignitability, and reactivity_and the secondary
adjustment criteria (BHP). Based on this evaluation, the Agency today is proposing an adjusted RQ of 100 pounds for
2,4,6-tribromophenol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's evaluations of 2,4,6-tribromophenol for the other two primary RQ adjustment criteria (chronic toxicity
and potential carcinogenicity) are not yet complete. If, when completed, these evaluations result in an RQ lower
than the 100-pound RQ proposed today, the Agency will repropose the RQ for 2,4,6-tribromophenol at the lower level.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other waste, K140, is a waste stream with only one hazardous constituent_2,4,6-tribromophenol. Therefore,
in accordance with the RQ adjustment methodology described above, an adjusted RQ of 100 pounds is being proposed today
for K140. Because the RQ for K140 is based on the RQ for 2,4,6-tribromophenol, any reproposal of the 2,4,6-tribromophenol
RQ required by further evaluation will be accompanied by a corresponding reproposal of the RQ for K140.

VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), whenever an Agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory
flexibility analysis (RFA) that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions). No RFA is required, however, if
the head of the Agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since EPA has determined the hazardous wastes proposed for listing here are not generated by small entities (as defined
by the Regulatory Flexibility Act), and the Agency believes that small entities will not generate them in significant
quantities, this regulation, therefore, does not require a RFA. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this regulation
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, when new hazardous wastes are listed, all persons who generate, transport, treat, store, or dispose the
newly listed wastes(s) are required to notify either EPA, or a State authorized by EPA to operate the hazardous waste
program, of their activities pursuant to Section 3010 of RCRA. However, under the Solid Waste Disposal Amendments
of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;482), EPA was given the option of waiving the notification requirement for persons who handle
wastes that are covered by today's proposed listing and already have notified EPA that they manage other hazardous
wastes and have received an EPA identification number. This waiver is being proposed because of the likelihood that
persons managing today's proposed wastes already are managing one or more hazardous wastes that generally are associated
with the generation of proposed EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. K140 and U408 and, therefore, have previously notified EPA
and received an EPA identification number. In the event that any person who generates, transports, treats, stores,
or disposes these wastes and has not previously notified and received an identification number, that person must
obtain an identification number pursuant to 40 CFR 262.12 before that person can generate, transport, treat, store,
or dispose of these wastes.

Today's proposed listings will be promulgated pursuant to HSWA. HSWA requirements are applicable in authorized
States at the same time as in unauthorized States. Therefore, EPA will regulate the wastes being proposed today until
States are authorized to regulate these wastes. Once these regulations are promulgated in a final rule by EPA, the
Agency will apply these Federal regulations to these wastes and to their management in both authorized and unauthorized
States.

Newly-regulated facilities (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
facilities at which the only hazardous wastes that are managed are today's proposed wastes in units subject to permit
requirements when these listings are finalized) must qualify for interim status within six months of publication
of the rule in order to continue managing these wastes in such units. To retain interim status, a newly-regulated land
disposal facility must submit a part B permit application within eighteen months after publication of the rule and
certify that the facility is in compliance with all applicable ground-water monitoring and financial responsibility
requirements (see RCRA Section 3005(e)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interim status facilities that manage today's proposed wastes after these listings are promulgated, must file an
amended Part A permit application within six months of publication of the final rule if they are to continue managing
these wastes in units that require a permit. The facilities must file the necessary amendments by the effective date
of the rule, or they will not retain interim status with respect to today's proposed wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently permitted facilities that manage today's proposed wastes after their listings are finalized by EPA must
request permit modifications if they are to continue management of these wastes in units that require a permit. Since
EPA initially will be responsible for processing these permit modifications, the new Federal procedures for permit
modifications will be followed (see 53 FR 37934, September 28, 1988). These new procedures contain a specific provision
for newly listed or identified wastes (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 270.42(g)). This provision generally requires that a permitted facility that is ``in existence'' for the newly
listed or identified waste on the effective date of the waste listing must submit a Class 1 modification by that date.
Essentially, this modification notifies the Agency and the public that the facility is handling the waste and identifies
the units involved. By submitting this notice, the facility temporarily is allowed to continue management of the
newly-listed wastes until the Agency can make a final change to the permit. Next, within 180 days of the effective date
the permittee must submit a more detailed permit modification request (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a Class 2 or 3 modification). This information will be used by the Agency to develop a final permit change. For more information
on permit modifications see the September 28, 1988 preamble discussion referenced above.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to amend its regulations on the use and recredit of sick leave for
Federal employees. The proposed regulations would expand the use of sick leave by permitting employees to use up to
a total of 5 workdays of sick leave each leave year (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon
tour of duty, the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled tour of duty each week) to provide care
for a child, spouse, or parent as a result of sickness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; make arrangements necessitated
by the death of a child, spouse, or parent; or attend the funeral of a child, spouse, or parent. In addition,the proposed
regulations would remove the 3-year break-in-service limitation on the recredit of sick leave.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR 630.401 to provide that agencies must grant a limited amount of sick leave to employees who
provide care for a child, spouse, or parent as a result of sickness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; to make arrangements
necessitated by the death of a child, spouse, or parent; or to attend the funeral of a child, spouse, or parent. The proposed
regulations would limit the use of sick leave for these purposes to a total of 5 workdays in a leave year (or, in the case
of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the average number of hours of work in the employee's
scheduled tour of duty each week).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR 630.502 and 504 to remove the 3-year break-in-service limitation on the recredit
of sick leave and permit employees who separate from Federal service to have their unused and accrued sick leave recredited
in full to their sick leave accounts upon return to Federal service. Under the proposed regulations, sick leave would
be recredited to the employee regardless of the duration of the break in Federal service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed changes in the Federal leave system were recommended in the Report of the National Performance Review
on September 7, 1993, and are part of OPM's continuing effort to develop human resource policies that are sensitive
to the needs of employees and thereby enhance the Federal Government's ability to recruit and retain a well-qualified
workforce. The purpose of the proposed changes in the circumstances under which employees may use sick leave is to
recognize the needs of Federal employees who struggle to maintain an often precarious balance between work and family
and to assist the Federal Government in recruiting and retaining the employees it needs to accomplish its mission.
We have also proposed additional changes in &sect;630.401 to clarify our intent with regard to situations involving
exposure to a severe contagious/communicable disease. We describe a severe communicable disease as one that requires
isolation for a specified period, as prescribed by the health authorities having jurisdiction or as determined by
a health care provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the similarity of purpose, OPM proposes to use the same definitions of ``child,'' ``spouse,'' and ``parent''
as those used for ``son or daughter,'' ``spouse,'' and ``parent'' in the interim regulations implementing the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993. (See 5 CFR 630.1202.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in rules on the recredit of sick leave would ensure that, in the future, employees who have conscientiously
maintained a substantial sick leave balance could leave Federal employment for any purpose (including the need to
care for a child, spouse, or parent) without the risk of forfeiting all accrued sick leave upon returning to Federal
employment thereafter. We believe this change would help to foster the conscientious use of sick leave by all employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed regulations also include conforming changes in &sect;630.402 (Application for sick leave),
&sect;630.403 (Supporting evidence), and &sect;630.405 (Use of sick leave during annual leave).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to limit public access, occupancy and use of a portion of the O'Malley
River drainage and adjacent lands bordering Karluk Lake and O'Malley Lake within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge
(Refuge). Public use of a parcel of land and water consisting of approximately 3,955 acres will be restricted from
June 25 through September 30 annually to individuals participating in a refuge-sponsored bear viewing program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This seasonal closure is necessary to prevent incompatible conflicts between people and brown bears at an important
bear concentration area, during the season when conflicts and impacts on bears are most prevalent. It is intended
to control increasing human use of a very important bear concentration area so that human uses in the area remain compatible
with refuge purposes. Research and experience have clearly demonstrated that control of human activity in major
bear concentration areas is necessary to avoid conflicts between people and bears. Organized bear viewing programs
elsewhere in Alaska have proven highly successful in reducing conflict to an acceptable level while maintaining
quality public use opportunities. This action will allow quality public viewing and photography opportunities
through the O'Malley Bear Viewing Program without adversely affecting bear use of this important feeding area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge by Executive Order 8857 on August
14, 1941, to ``preserve the natural feeding and breeding ground of the brown bear and other wildlife.'' This action
withdrew about 1.9 million acres from unreserved public domain on Kodiak and Uganik Islands. Congress redesignated
the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in 1980 when it enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).
All the lands, water, interests, and submerged lands retained in federal ownership at the time of statehood were included
in the refuge. This legislation also added about 50,000 acres of public lands on Afognak and Ban Islands to Kodiak National
Wildlife Refuge. Section 303 (5) (b) of ANILCA states generally that ``[t]he purposes for which Kodiak National Wildlife
Refuge is established and shall be managed include (i) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their
natural diversity including, but not limited to, Kodiak brown bears, salmonoids, sea otters, sea lions, and other
marine mammals and migratory birds; (ii) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with
respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) to provide, in a manner consistent with purposes set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), the opportunity for
continued subsistence use by local residents; and (iv) to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable and in a manner
consistent with the purposes set forth in subparagraph (i), water quality and necessary water quantity within the
refuge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kodiak Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1987) provides primary guidance
for management of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. According to its approved alternative, ``the Service will
undertake detailed management planning to guide implementation of the plan and operation of the refuge.'' In support
of that mandate, utilizing a full spectrum of public involvement, the final draft of the Kodiak Refuge Public Use Management
Plan has been written. This proposed rule and the interim rule which is being published elsewhere in this separate
part of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are a result of direction provided by both these planning processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During 1990&hyph;91 the Service tested a trial bear viewing program, staffed by Refuge personnel, at the Dog Salmon
Creek Fish Pass on Kodiak Refuge. No closure was utilized for unguided use, but guided use was restricted through the
special use permit process. This trial bear viewing program was successful except that the presence of artificial
fish passage structures significantly impaired the quality of viewing opportunities available to the public.

Public use is increasing about ten percent annually on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and available information
indicates the rate of increase is even greater in the O'Malley River area. Also, a trend of increasing adverse interactions
between people and bears has occurred in the O'Malley River area in recent years. Generally, brown bears are negatively
impacted by expanding human use. Bears are often killed ``in defense of life or property'' as a consequence of increased
levels of human activity in areas that are used heavily by bears. In addition to mortality, interaction between bears
and people can impose stress on bears that ultimately affect survival and/or productivity of bears as well as jeopardize
human safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, a research camp was established on the O'Malley River to study bear use of the area and potential impacts of
public use on bears. Research data document human impacts on bears in the O'Malley River area and confirm the need to
control or restrict human uses in this area. The O'Malley River area supports approximately 33% of the entire brown
bear population in the Karluk Lake basin. At least 110 different bears used the O'Malley River area during July&hyph;September
1991, with peak use occurring during the second and third weeks of July. More importantly, refuge research data suggest
that frequently sighted bears represent only a small portion of the total population utilizing the O'Malley River
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During approximately 250 hours of intensive observation of bear groups in the O'Malley River area in 1991, 66 interactions
between bears and people were recorded. One-third of the interactions disturbed and/or displaced the bears by causing
them to run or walk away from people. In one instance, people caused the separation of a female from one of her first-year
cubs; while trying to locate its mother, the cub was subsequently killed by another bear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives considered in response to the public use/bear problems in the O'Malley River area include closing the
area to all public use, which would satisfy the need to conserve bears, but would eliminate all opportunity for public
use during the period of closure. The area could be left open to provide ample public use opportunity, but this use would
have incompatible impacts on refuge bear populations. Seasonal closure in support of a bear viewing program not only
would satisfy the need to conserve bears, but would also make possible continued public use. No other alternative
could provide both benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refuge's trial bear viewing program initiated at Dog Salmon Creek was moved to the O'Malley River area in 1992 because
of the documented problems and incompatibility between high and unregulated public use and bears in the O'Malley
area. A temporary closure, pursuant to 50 CFR 36.42, was utilized to avoid conflicts between people and bears at this
important seasonal bear concentration area. Goals of the trial O'Malley bear viewing program were:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. To replace an incompatible level of unrestricted use of the O'Malley River area during key bear use periods, with
a compatible recreational opportunity which would protect and conserve brown bear populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To develop and maintain a program that provides the general public a safe and professional guided bear viewing opportunity,
that is consistent with Refuge management objectives and policies established in the Comprehensive Conservation
Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program proved popular with the public; in 1992, 88 persons participated. The Service was satisfied that both
program goals were adequately met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The O'Malley Bear Viewing Program is designed to increase wildlife viewing opportunities for the public. The brown
bears of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge offer unique and highly desirable opportunities for viewing; opportunities
that are most safely and effectively provided by a structured viewing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Structured wildlife viewing programs have been used successfully as a conservation management tool and to enhance
public use opportunities elsewhere in Alaska. The best known program is conducted at the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary
by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The McNeil River program has gained a worldwide reputation for quality bear
viewing, and competition for permits is so intense that applicants have less than an 8 percent chance of obtaining
a permit. Another popular bear viewing program is conducted at Brooks Camp in Katmai National Park. The number of visitors
at Brooks Camp is not limited except by availability of lodge and campground facilities. Use of these facilities during
peak visitation periods is presently at or beyond capacity and the National Park Service may limit the number of visitors
in the future. A third bear viewing program is located at Pack Creek on Admiralty Island and is cooperatively managed
by the U.S. Forest Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Permits are required to visit Pack Creek; during
1993 the Forest Service announced that the number of visits to Pack Creek will be limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experience at McNeil River State Game Sanctuary has demonstrated that brown bears are least disturbed by human activity
that is consistent and predictable. Studies at the Brooks Camp and Pack Creek bear viewing programs have confirmed
that unpredictable human activity causes some bears to avoid important habitat. Inconsistent human activity has
also been shown to cause conflicts between people and bears. At the McNeil River Sanctuary, implementation of a structured
bear viewing program increased bear use and at the same time reduced the incidence of bear/human conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successful reduction of conflict, through implementation of a structured brown bear viewing program at O'Malley
River, will require control of public use and access. Restriction of public use and access to anyone not participating
in the viewing program will promote a quality wildlife experience for participants and reduce the potential for serious
and incompatible conflicts between refuge visitors and bears. Public use and access would be restricted only seasonally,
from June 25 to September 30. These dates were selected because it is the time period when the greatest number of bears
are concentrated in the O'Malley River area to feed on the seasonal salmon runs that provide a critical component of
their diet. Consequently, this is the period bears are most vulnerable to adverse impacts from excessive and unpredictable
human use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has issued a permit, under which a private operator will conduct the O'Malley Program, for the period 1994&hyph;1998.
The program will be thoroughly evaluated during 1994 and, if successful, will be continued. If unsuccessful, the
program will be discontinued but the public use closure would be retained to protect feeding bears from incompatible
disturbance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd), the Secretary
is authorized under such regulations as he may prescribe to permit the use of any area within the National Wildlife
Refuge System for any purpose whenever he determines that such uses are compatible with the major purposes for which
such areas were established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) authorizes the Secretary to administer such areas for public recreation
as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the
primary purposes for which the area was established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 304 of ANILCA requires the Secretary to prescribe such regulations and impose such terms and conditions as
may be necessary and appropriate to ensure that any activities carried out on a national wildlife refuge in Alaska
under any permit or easement granted under any authority are compatible with the purposes of that refuge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1306 of ANILCA permits the Service to provide visitor facilities in the refuge if compatible with the unit's
purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is being generated to help structure public use. Adequately regulated public use is consistent with and
will not interfere with the refuge purposes delineated above, and is thus compatible with the purposes for which Kodiak
National Wildlife Refuge was established according to 16 U.S.C. 668(dd).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public hearing on this proposed rule was advertised in Alaska and held on April 26, 1994, at Kodiak High School, Kodiak,
Alaska. Department of Interior policy is, whenever practicable, to afford the public a meaningful opportunity to
participate in the rulemaking process. A 60 day comment period is specified in order to both facilitate public input
and move forward to protect important refuge resources. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments
concerning this proposed rule to the persons listed above under the heading ADDRESSES. All substantive comments
will be reviewed and considered.

This rulemaking is categorically excluded under 40 CFR 1508.4 from the requirements of the National Environmental
Protection Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347) as an administrative action that will have no potential for causing
substantial environmental impact.

Economic Effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the proposed rule will seasonally close two tenths of one percent (.02%) of Kodiak Refuge lands,
to commercial operators and public use not connected with the organized bear viewing program. Observations by refuge
personnel indicate that commercial use of the closure area has historically been steady. All use (commercial and
non-commercial) was estimated to have averaged 266 user days during 1989 and 1990, and 353 user days during 1991. These
levels of use will clearly be exceeded by the amount of commercial use (minimum of 480 user days) that will be allowed
under terms of a permit authorizing the bear viewing program. Thus, a net gain of commercial use is expected to occur.
Also, at least a portion of the commercial use previously occurring in the closure area will simply be displaced to
another location and therefore not lost to the local economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in use of the resource will have no significant effect on national income. Private income will be enhanced,
but dollar amounts will be small and have insignificant impact on the local economy. Agency costs for monitoring the
closure and the bear viewing commercial operation will be approximately $40,000 less than that expended during fiscal
year 1992 for program operation by the government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small
entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This proposed rule would have
minimal effect on such entities.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document has two objectives. The rule would implement Title X, Subtitle B, sections 10101 through 10106 of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312) (the Act), which are entitled
``Hardrock Mining Claim Maintenance Fee.'' Section 10106 of the Act requires the Secretary to issue regulations
implementing the Act as soon as practicable after enactment. The Act extends, in effect, with certain modifications,
the mining claim fee provisions of the Act of October 5, 1992, until September 30, 1998. These Acts require, unless
the claimant qualifies for an exemption (or waiver), payment of an annual fee of $100 per mining claim or site located
and held on the public lands pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872. The Act also establishes a new location fee of
$25 for each new mining claim or site located on public lands on or after August 11, 1993, and before September 30, 1998,
which is required to be paid at the time of recording of the mining claim or site with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
under section 314(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the regulations in 43 CFR 3833.
It also implements the new location and recording requirements for mining claims located on Stockraising Homestead
Act lands required by the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It removes obsolete or expired provisions, and consolidates provisions that are still in force and effect, in the
regulations concerning location and entry of mining claims and sites on coal bearing lands, on the National Park System
units, the King Range Conservation Area, and Indian reservations.

1. Maintenance and Location Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of this rule is devoted to amending the regulations (43 CFR parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850) previously published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38186), and corrected on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41184). That rule implemented the Act of October
5, 1992 (106 Stat. 1374), which required a $100 rental fee per mining claim or site for the 1993 and 1994 assessment years,
with payment due for both assessment years by August 31, 1993. The law exempted claimants who owned 10 or fewer mining
claims and sites and met other criteria. The 1993 Act extended the $100 per claim or site fee to September 30, 1998, making
it an annual payment of $100 due on each August 31st, to hold the claim or site for the upcoming assessment year. The name
of the fee was changed in the Act from ``rental fee'' to ``maintenance fee.'' A new fee of $25, called a location fee,
is required under section 10102 of the Act. It is a one-time fee to be paid to BLM at the time the new mining claim or site
is recorded. The Act allows a waiver from the maintenance fee for claimants who own 10 or fewer mining claims and sites,
for certain mining claims and sites undergoing reclamation, and for several other situations. Numerous specific
provisions in the regulations on mining would be amended to reflect the new terminology and the requirements of the
1993 Act. These include provisions relating to filing claims on O. and C. (revested Oregon and California Railroad
and Reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant) Lands in subpart 3821. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 16, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;23 (107 Stat. 60) was enacted, requiring new procedures and filings for claimants
locating and operating mining claims on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA, 43 U.S.C.
299). Effective October 13, 1993, prior to locating a mining claim on such lands, a claimant is required to file with
the Secretary of the Interior a notice of intent to locate a mining claim and to notify the surface owner of such notice
of intent. SRHA lands may not be entered for the location of a mining claim until 30 days after the surface owner has received
notice of the filing of such notice of intent to locate. Filing of the notice of intent with BLM also has the effect of
segregating the land sought for 90 days from all other land and mineral entry by anyone else. Filing of a Plan of Operations
(now required by the SRHA) extends the segregation until the Plan is approved or denied by the BLM District Office.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A section-by-section discussion of the amendments to implement these statutory changes follows. Other changes
would be made in certain sections for purposes of updating and clarifying the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3730_Public Law 359; Mining in Power Site Withdrawals: General. The sections on authorities (&sect;3730.0&hyph;3)
and information collection (&sect;3730.0&hyph;9) would be amended to add references to the Act of August 10, 1993
(107 Stat. 312). The section on Purpose (&sect;3730.0&hyph;1) would also be amended to refer to lands included under
the O. and C. Act, and would be subdivided for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3734_Location and Assessment Work. Section 3734.1 of this subpart, which requires the owner of a claim to
file notice of location and assessment work, would be amended at paragraphs (a) and (c) to provide for the maintenance
fee required by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3833_Recordation of Mining Claims, Mill Sites, and Tunnel Sites; Payment of Service Charges, Rental, Maintenance,
and Location Fees. This subpart, including its title, would be amended to reflect the addition of maintenance and
location fees required by the Act. Various sections would be amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.0&hyph;1&blank;Purpose. Paragraph (c) of this section would be amended to add as a purpose the implementation
of the annual maintenance fee established by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.0&hyph;3&blank;Authority. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section would be amended by adding the Act
to the rental fee authority. A new paragraph (g) would be added to implement the mining claim entry and location amendments
to the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916 enacted by Public Law 103&hyph;23, 107 Stat. 60. The new paragraph cross-references
part 3814, which has not yet been amended to reflect the Act of April 16, 1993, as of this publication. However, BLM is
preparing a proposed rule that would amend part 3814 for this purpose. A new paragraph (h) would be added to refer to
the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. Appendix 565), which excuses active duty military personnel
from performance of assessment work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3833.0&hyph;5&blank;Definitions. The definitions section would be amended by revising the definitions
of ``owner,'' ``proper BLM office,'' ``file or filed,'' ``filing year,'' ``rental fee,'' and ``small miner,'' and
adding definitions of ``maintenance fee,'' ``location fee,'' ``related party,'' and ``control,'' new terms introduced
in the Act. Also added are definitions of ``forfeiture,'' ``returnable,'' and ``refundable.'' The rule would define
``forfeiture'' as it pertains to mining claims or sites under section 314 of FLPMA, and the acts of October 5, 1992,
and August 10, 1993. The U.S. Supreme Court, in

Locke, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
471 U.S. 84 (1985), determined that the term ``abandonment'' as used in FLPMA was equivalent to ``forfeiture.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``owner'' would be amended to make it clear that ownership of a mining claim is determined by State
and Federal law, and that the owner's current address of record is required to be stated on all instruments recorded
or filed with the BLM under this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``proper BLM office'' would be amended to add the Northern District Offices Records and Public Information
Unit in Fairbanks, Alaska, as a proper recording office for mining claim instruments in Alaska, in addition to the
office in Anchorage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``file or filed'' would be amended to apply the postmark rule to rental and maintenance fees, to the
filing of waiver statements by qualified small miners, and new locations or certificates of location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``filing year'' would be amended by substituting the term ``filing period,'' and divided to define
the filing dates for fees or exemptions under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``rental fee'' would be amended to remove language pertaining to the rental fee required by the Act
of October 5, 1992, which is no longer necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``nonrefundable'' would be removed, and a new section 3833.1&hyph;8 would be added to the regulations
providing for the refund of maintenance and location fees as well as rental fees under certain circumstances, in order
to conform to the Act, and further clarifying under what conditions a refund may be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.0&hyph;9&blank;Information collection. This section would be amended to add the Acts of April 16,
1993, and August 10, 1993, to the authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;2&blank;Recordation of mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites located after October
21, 1976. This section would be amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to explain the requirements of the Act of April
16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60), which amended the SRHA as it pertains to the location of mining claims. The Act of April 16, 1993,
places additional requirements for approval of mineral operations on Stockraising Homestead lands and for additional
bonding to protect the surface owner from the effects of mining operations. These additional requirements will be
covered by another proposed rule to amend 43 CFR subpart 3814. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;3&blank;Service charges, rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees; form of remittance
and acceptance. This section is amended to add the maintenance and location fees, and restructured to clarify the
payment-for-services policy with respect to mining claim documents, filings, and fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;4&blank;Service charges and location fees. This section is amended to add the maintenance
and location fees into the appropriate paragraphs, and is reorganized for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;5&blank;Rental fees and maintenance fees. This section is amended to add the maintenance fees
to the existing rental fees, and to state when and under what circumstances each is due and payable. A new paragraph
(g) is added to allow an exempted mining claim, if transferred to a party not entitled to a waiver, to have the rental
or maintenance fee otherwise owed on the mining claim paid by the transferee at the time of recording the transfer pursuant
to 3833.3 of this title. A new paragraph (h) is added to implement section 10105(c) of the Act of August 10, 1993. This
section of the Act requires that the maintenance fee and location fee be adjusted every five years, or allows adjustments
to be made sooner if the Secretary deems it reasonable, based upon any changes in the Consumer Price Index. Notice of
any change is required to be given by July 1st of any year, with the new fee due by August 31st of that same year. A new paragraph
(i) is added to state that the $100 annual maintenance fee applies to all mill and tunnel sites, and that a waiver of payment
of the fee for mill and tunnel sites may be obtained under special circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;6&blank;Maintenance fee waiver qualifications under the Act of August 10, 1993_Applicable
from 12 O'clock noon on September 1, 1993, until 12 O'clock noon September 1, 1998. This section would be retitled and
revised to identify the conditions under which a waiver of payment of the maintenance fees under the Act may be obtained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;7&blank;Filing requirements for maintenance fee exemptions (waivers). This section would
be revised to identify the documents required and deadlines for applying for a waiver of payment of the maintenance
fees under the Act. This provision operates in advance of each upcoming assessment year. The assessment work performed
during a given assessment year, certified to under this section, holds the mining claim for the next assessment year
without payment of the maintenance fee. For those claimants who do not pay the required claim maintenance fee and who
instead seek a waiver from such payment requirement, the failure to file a certified statement by each August 31 certifying
that the assessment work was done for the assessment year just ending will cause the mining claim to be forfeited under
the Act. In addition, failure to file affidavits of annual assessment work on or before December 30 of the year in which
the small miner certification was made will cause the mining claim to be forfeited under the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act. (For example, a certification filed by a qualified claimant on August 31, 1994, certifies performance
of assessment work for the assessment year that began at noon on September 1, 1993. This allows a waiver of payment of
the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994, to hold the claim for the assessment year beginning at noon on September
1, 1994. However, if the affidavit of labor is not filed by December 30, 1994, for the work done for the assessment year
beginning at noon September 1, 1993, the claims are deemed abandoned and void and are forfeited. This process begins
again with the next certification deadline of August 31, 1995). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.1&hyph;8&blank;Refundability of service charges, location fees, rental and maintenance fees. This
section, which would be moved from &sect;3833.0&hyph;5(v) in the current regulations, would be amended to reference
location and maintenance fees, allow refunds of service fees in certain circumstances, allow for refunds of duplicate
payments, and allow for refunds in any other situation in which a payment is made for a mining claim that was void by operation
of law at the time the payment was made. Also added is a provision that voluntary actions are not considered a reason
for a refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.2&hyph;3&blank;Consistency between the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the General Mining
Law of May 10, 1872, the Act of October 5, 1992, and the Act of August 10, 1993. The section title would be revised to add
the Act of August 10, 1993, and paragraphs (d) and (e) would be amended to reflect the new dates in 1999 when assessment
work is required to be resumed when the Act expires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.2&hyph;6&blank;When evidence or notice is not required. This section would be amended to add the conditions
contained in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.3&blank;Notice of transfer of interest. Paragraph (c) would be amended to state clearly when a transfer
of interest becomes effective on the title records of BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3833.4&blank;Failure to file, or to pay rental, maintenance fees, or location fees. The section title would
be revised by adding maintenance and location fees. Paragraph (a) would be amended by adding the conditions of the
Act. The amendment in this paragraph would not allow claimants who do not qualify for a small miner waiver to claim a
waiver on only ten or fewer claims. This provision does not cause an automatic relinquishment of a claimant's mining
claims or sites that are over the ten-claim limit for small miner waivers. Paragraph (b) would be amended by correcting
cross-references. A new paragraph (c) would be added to explain the Bureau's policy on the effect of failure by a purchaser
or transferee of a mining claim or site to record the new ownership interest with the BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3851_Assessment Work: General. This subpart also would be amended to implement the statutory changes contained
in the Act. A discussion of the sections to be affected and the changes to be made follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3851.3&blank;Effect of failure to perform assessment work. Paragraph (c) of this section would be amended
to state that the Act suspends and supersedes the requirements to perform assessment work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3851.4&blank;Failure of a co-owner to contribute to annual assessment work or to the payment of rental or
maintenance fees. The section title would be amended by adding maintenance fees. The existing section is divided
into new paragraphs (a) and (b) and the failure to pay the maintenance fee is added as another ground for action against
a delinquent co-owner. A new paragraph (c) would be added to identify the action required of co-owners who have met
the publication requirements of &sect;3851.4 to terminate the interest of a delinquent co-owner, and would like
the BLM record title to the mining claim corrected. A new paragraph (d) would be added to refer to the Soldier's and Sailor's
Relief Act and the fact that pursuant to that Act, an active duty military person may not be so ``published out'' for
failure to contribute as long as he or she is on active duty and has complied with &sect;3851.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3851.5&blank;Assessment work not required after allowance of mineral entry. This section would be amended
to reflect the effects of the Act on claims for which mineral patent applications have been filed. After the first half
of the mineral entry final certificate has been issued by the Secretary of the Interior confirming the mineral entry,
there is no longer a requirement to perform assessment work, and no requirement to pay the rental or maintenance fees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;3851.6&blank;Assessment work not required for active duty military personnel. This new section would
be added to explain how an active duty military person may apply for and receive an exemption from the performance of
assessment work and payment of maintenance fees under the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act.

Subpart 3852_Deferment of Assessment Work. This subpart would be amended for purposes of updating and clarification.
Amendments would occur in the following sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3852.0&hyph;3&blank;Authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3852.2&blank;Filing of Petition for deferment, contents. The first two sentences of paragraph (a) would

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3852.3&blank;Notice of action on petition to be recorded. This section would be amended to state more clearly
the recording requirements for a petitioner, once the BLM authorized officer has ruled on the merits of the petition
for deferment of assessment work.

2. Removal of Obsolete Provisions and General Streamlining of Mining Law Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parts 3720, 3800, 3810 and 3820 of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations have subparts and sections that are no longer
in effect or no longer operative due to the repeal of the statutes upon which they are based or the transfer of the regulatory
authority to another Interior agency that has promulgated new rules to replace the current rules. The proposed rule
would reflect these changes. Subpart 3827 is consolidated into subpart 3809, as the two sets of surface management
regulations are duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 3720_Public Law 357; Entry and Location of Source Materials upon Public Lands Valuable for Coal; Subpart 3722_Report
to Geological Survey. Existing part 3720 and subpart 3722 of this title are based upon Section 1 of the Act of August
11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 541), concerning payment by mining claimants to the United States for the value of lignite coal
mined and removed in the development of mines for source materials (uranium, thorium, and other radioactive minerals).
As further provided by section 10 of the Act of August 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 541i), this provision expired on August 11,
1975, and all mining claims located upon coal-bearing lands under this Act terminated by operation of law unless patent
had been applied for prior to August 11, 1975. All coal lands were removed from mineral location and entry as of August
11, 1975. Therefore, part 3720, including subpart 3722, would be removed in its entirety and the part number reserved
for future use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3809_Surface Management. This subpart would be amended to add the statute designating the King Range Conservation
Area to the authorities section, to define the term in the definitions section, and to include the King Range in &sect;3809.1&hyph;4(b)
as an area requiring a mandatory plan of operations for all activities exceeding casual use. The authorities section
will also be amended to include the Act of April 16, 1993, for Stockraising Homestead Act lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3811_Lands Subject to Location and Purchase. Three sections in this subpart are no longer necessary and would
be revised or removed. Section 3811.2&hyph;2 relates to lands in National Parks and National Monuments. The Mining
in the Parks Act (16 U.S.C. 1901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), effectively closed all National Parks and Monuments to any further mining claim location or mineral entry. After
September 28, 1976, no mining claims could be located in any unit of the National Park System. The existing language
of &sect;3811.2&hyph;2, which provides that certain National Parks and Monuments are open to mining claim location,
no longer serves any purpose. Regulations governing access to existing mining claims on National Parks and Monuments,
and operations thereon, were published by the National Park Service in 1977, and are now codified at 36 CFR part 9. Section
3811.2&hyph;2 would be revised to state simply that no units of the National Park System are open to the location of
mining claims under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3811.2&hyph;3&blank;Lands in Indian reservations. This section would be revised to state that all Indian
reservations are closed to the location of mining claims and to entry under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended.
The Papago Indian Reservation in Arizona (now called the To Ho No O'odham Reservation) was open to mining claim location
and entry from June 18, 1934, until May 27, 1955, pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461&hyph;479, as amended).
Since May 27, 1955, this reservation has been closed to mining claim location, pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (25
U.S.C. 463). All minerals on lands in Indian reservations may be acquired only by lease pursuant to the Act of May 11,
1938 (25 U.S.C. 396a), the Act of March 3, 1909 (25 U.S.C. 396), or the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, 25 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3811.2&hyph;8&blank;Lands under Alaska Public Sale Act. The Alaska Public Sale Act (48 U.S.C. 364a-364e)
was repealed effective October 21, 1986, by Section 703(a) of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1701). Accordingly, &sect;3811.2&hyph;8
would be removed in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3821.0&hyph;3&blank;Authority. This section is amended to add the Act of August 10, 1993, as one of the authorities
for the regulations in part 3820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3821.2&blank;Requirements for filing notices of locations of claims; descriptions. This section is amended
to add maintenance, location, and service fees as fees payable under part 3820 when locating a claim. A further change
states that the location notice or amendment is required to indicate the applicable acts under which the claim is filed.

), which closed and withdrew from all forms of mineral entry and appropriation all lands and units of the National Park
System. The authority for administering the mining claims and sites located within the units prior to September 28,
1976, has been transferred to the National Park Service. Access to and operations upon mining claims and sites located
within the units of the National Park System are now governed by 36 CFR part 9, and subpart 3826 would be removed in this
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 3827_King Range National Conservation Area. This subpart will be removed because it is duplicated in subpart
3809. It became effective in April 1976 to implement the surface management requirements of the Act of October 21,
1970 (84 Stat. 1070), which established the King Range National Conservation Area. Section 5 of that Act required
that all activities occurring pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) be managed to prevent environmental damage and provide for reclamation. Subsequent to the April 1976 rule, on October
21, 1976, FLPMA was enacted. Section 302(b) of that Act required that all public lands be managed to prevent undue or
unnecessary degradation from activities on them, including activities under the General Mining Law of 1872. Section
602 of FLPMA expanded the boundaries of the King Range Conservation Area. Subsequently, regulations were promulgated
at 43 CFR subpart 3809 in November 1980 regulating all mining activities on public lands under the administration
of the Bureau. These regulations in subpart 3809 duplicate subpart 3827 in form, content, and requirements. Therefore,
the regulations in subpart 3827 would be merged with subpart 3809, and subpart 3809 would be amended to include the
King Range Conservation Area, under the same criteria as currently apply to the California Desert Conservation Area.
Since enactment of FLPMA, the BLM has received no Plans of Operations for mining in the King Range Conservation Area
lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The BLM has determined that this rule is categorically
excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual, Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10,
and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant
to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of
the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually
or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in
procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact
statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number
of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The fee may represent an economic consideration for a small, marginal operation that does not qualify for an exemption
under the rule. However, most small operations would qualify. A small entity that holds a valuable mining claim will
not be deterred by the annual fee, and many of them will qualify for an exemption. Most marginal claims were already
abandoned in 1993 upon promulgation of the regulations implementing the Act of October 5, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a
taking of private property. The requirement that a modest fee be paid to hold or maintain an existing unpatented mining
claim, mill or tunnel site constitutes a reasonable regulatory burden, and it will have no effect on a claimant's possessory
interest in or enjoyment of his or her claim or site as long as he or she complies with the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards
provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions for collection of information contained at 43 CFR parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850, and subpart 3809
have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance numbers 1004&hyph;0104,
1004&hyph;0110, and 1004&hyph;0114. Information collections for parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850 were consolidated
under clearance number 1004&hyph;0114 in the July 15, 1993 rulemaking (58 FR 38186). As this rulemaking removes obsolete
or inoperative sections of title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, and extends the previously enacted Act of October
5, 1992, and implementing regulations published on July 15, 1993, this rule does not contain information collection
requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501

of the Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312), require an annual rental or maintenance fee of $100
to be paid to the proper State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for each non-exempt mining claim, mill site, or
tunnel site located or held under section 314(b) of FLPMA for the assessment years beginning on September 1, 1992,
and ending on September 1, 1998. With certain exceptions provided in &sect;3833.1&hyph;6, this fee is in lieu of the

oil shale claims for which a fee is required to be paid under section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The
$550 fee requirement for oil shale claims remains in effect. The $550 fee is first payable on or before December 31,
1993, and each December 31st thereafter.

to in &sect;3833.1&hyph;2(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Failure to provide full payment of service charges set forth in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 will be curable for new location
notices or certificates submitted for recording pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 when the proper maintenance and
location fees have been submitted. Such documents shall be noted as being recorded on the date received provided that
the claimant submits the proper service charge within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice that will be sent by
the authorized officer. The claimant may resubmit the notices or certificates of location with the proper payment
of service charges and fees within the same 90-day filing period referred to in &sect;3833.1&hyph;2(a). Failure

documents and filings will be noted as being recorded on the date initially received provided that the claimant submits
the proper service charge within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to
submit the proper service charge as required by this paragraph will cause filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2
and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1 to be rejected and returned to the claimant/owner. If a
payment is received that partially covers the claims submitted, the payment shall be applied to claims in ascending
numerical order of serialization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claimant fails to submit the proper rental or maintenance fees on or before each August 31, the authorized officer
will apply the rental or maintenance fees received to existing recorded and serialized mining claims and sites in
ascending numerical order of serialization, unless otherwise directed by the claimant. The authorized officer
will note the deficient fees as being paid on the original date received, provided that the claimant submits the proper
fees within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer, if that much time remains before
August 31. If there are less than 30 days before August 31, the correct fees shall be filed (see &sect;3833.0&hyph;5(m))
by such claimant on or before the August 31 deadline. Failure to submit the proper fees will cause the remaining claims
or sites to be forfeited by the claimant/owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After each August 31 payment deadline, if a claimant failed to file full payment of the proper rental or maintenance
fees on time, the authorized officer will apply any rental or maintenance fees received to existing recorded and serialized
mining claims and sites in ascending numerical order of serialization. Existing mining claims and sites to which
no rental fee or maintenance fee can be applied because of the insufficiency of the funds paid to the authorized officer
will be deemed null and void by operation of law, and therefore forfeited by the owner.

A small miner may, under certain conditions described in this section and in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, perform the assessment
work required under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and record it pursuant to section 314(a) of FLPMA and &sect;3833.2 in lieu
of paying the maintenance fee. Assessment work shall conform to the requirements contained in subpart 3851 of this
title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In order to qualify for a waiver of the maintenance fee requirements, a small miner shall meet all of the following
conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant and all related parties shall hold no more than 10 mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, or any
combination thereof, on Federal lands in the United States. For purposes of determining the small miner waiver, oil
shale claims shall not be counted toward the 10 claim limitation for the small miner waiver to the $100 maintenance
fee. A claimant who owns 10 or fewer claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, and otherwise meets the requirements of this
section, is not precluded from paying the maintenance fee in addition to filing for a small miner waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All mining claims and sites held by a claimant and all related parties shall be counted toward the 10 claim and site
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mill and tunnel sites of a qualified small miner, if listed upon the exemption certificate along with the affected
lode and placer mining claims, are waived from payment of the $100 maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Mining claims and sites that are undergoing final reclamation as approved by the authorized officer with no intent
by the owner thereof to continue mining, milling, or processing operations upon or under the mining claims or sites,
are excused from payment of the maintenance fees. The owner shall file a certified statement by August 31 in the proper
BLM office attesting to the reclamation status of the affected mining claims and/or sites, with reference to a reclamation
plan approved by the authorized officer, and to his or her intent to place them into permanent closure. A certified
statement of such intent and reclamation shall be filed pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7. The number of mining claims
or sites that may properly qualify for a reclamation waiver pursuant to this paragraph is not restricted to a 10-claim
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Pursuant to the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act (50 U.S.C. appendix 565), military personnel on active duty
status may, under certain conditions, qualify for an exemption from the performance of assessment work and the payment
of maintenance fees. See &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;7(e)(2) and 3851.6 of this title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the following circumstances, a waiver may be obtained from the payment of the maintenance fee for mining
claims and sites located upon National Park System lands: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant has received a declaration of taking or a notice of intent to take from the National Park Service pursuant
to sections 6 and 7 of the Act of September 28, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1905, 1906) or the Act of December 2, 1980, as
amended (16 U.S.C. 3192); or the claimant has otherwise been denied access by the United States to his/her mining claims
or sites on National Park Service lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The claimant shall file proof of the above conditions for exemption, attested to as a certified statement, pursuant
to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, with the proper BLM office by the August 31 immediately preceding the assessment year for
which a waiver is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims covered by a deferment of assessment work granted by the authorized
officer pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28(b)&hyph;(e) and subpart 3852 of this title may be deferred during the period for which
the deferment is granted. Deferments are governed by the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a petition for a deferment of assessment work, as required by &sect;3852.2 of this title, is filed with the proper
BLM office on or before August 31 for a given year, the maintenance fee need not be paid on the claims listed in the petition
for deferment until the authorized officer has acted upon the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the petition is granted, maintenance fees for the claims are deferred for the upcoming assessment year. At the
expiration of the deferment, all deferred fees shall be paid within 30 days of the end of the deferment, unless the claimant/owner
qualifies as a small miner. If the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner, all deferred assessment work shall be
done as provided in &sect;3852.5 of this title prior to filing for a small miner waiver.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) If the petition for deferment is denied by the authorized officer, the maintenance fees shall be paid within 30
days of receipt of the decision of the authorized officer denying the petition for deferment. Failure to pay the maintenance
fees owed will result in the claims contained within the petition being forfeited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) On mining claims for which an application for a mineral patent has been filed, and the mineral entry has been allowed,
the payment of the maintenance fee is excused for the assessment years during which assessment work is not required
pursuant to &sect;3851.5 of this title. However, no refund of previously deposited maintenance fees will be made
to the mineral patent applicant.

by a waiver under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed in the proper BLM office on or before August 31, 1994, and
shall contain all of the information required in paragraph (d). For mining claims and sites covered by a waiver, the
filing of a certified statement pursuant to any of paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section will satisfy the requirements
for filing of a notice of intention to hold pursuant to &sect;3833.2&hyph;5, when such notice of intention to hold

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The notice shall be filed in the assessment year that the person entered active duty status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The filing of the notice exempts the person from performing assessment work or paying the maintenance fees until
6 months have passed from the person's release from active duty status, or until 6 months have passed from release from
a military hospital, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The performance of assessment work or the payment of maintenance fees shall resume in the assessment year next
following the assessment year in which the person was released from active duty or a military hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The notice shall be filed as a certified statement pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and shall list all
mining claims and sites affected by claim/site name and BLM serial number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Claimants holding claims that are excused from performance of assessment work by other statutes are also excused
from payment of maintenance fees as part of their waivers. The claimant/owner shall file a certified statement pursuant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except for the filings required on or before December 30, 1992, beginning on October 5, 1992, the requirements
of &sect;&sect;3833.2&hyph;1 through 3833.2&hyph;5 are modified by the requirements of the Acts of October 5, 1992,
and August 10, 1993, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and these statutory provisions are now implemented in &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;5,

conclusively to constitute a forfeiture of the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For claimants who also fail to pay the maintenance fee, failure by a claimant who has filed a waiver certification
under &sect;3833.1&hyph;7 to perform the assessment work required by subpart 3851 of this title at the time of filing
the waiver certification, if the work was required under &sect;3833.1&hyph;7(a) through (d), will result in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Failure to list the 10 or fewer mining claims and/or sites for which the fee is waived on the applicable certification
document filed pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;6 or &sect;3833.1&hyph;7 or to pay the required amount of maintenance
fees by the prescribed August 31 will result in the affected mining claims and/or sites being conclusively deemed
forfeited by the owner or owners thereof.

shall not be conclusively deemed to constitute an abandonment or forfeiture of the claim or site, but such information
shall be submitted within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the authorized officer calling for such information.
Failure to submit the information requested by the decision of the authorized officer shall result in the mining claim,
mill site, or tunnel site being deemed abandoned by the owner and therefore forfeited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Failure to record a transfer of interest under &sect;3833.3 will result in the Bureau of Land Management refusing
to recognize the interest acquired by the transferee or to serve notice of any action, decision, or contest on the unrecorded

(c) The Acts of October 5, 1992, and August 10, 1993, with certain exceptions for small miners, temporarily suspend
and supersede the requirement to perform assessment work under &sect;3851.1, and require the payment of an annual
$100 rental or maintenance fee per mining claim in lieu of the assessment work. For oil shale claims, the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (30 U.S.C. 242) suspends and supersedes the requirement to perform assessment work under &sect;3851.1,
and requires the payment of an annual $550 rental fee per oil shale mining claim in lieu of the assessment work. The rental
and maintenance fee requirements and exemptions from payment of the rental fee or waivers from the maintenance fee

(a) Upon the failure of any co-owner of a mining claim to contribute a proportion of the required expenditures, the
co-owners who have performed the labor, made improvements, paid the rental or maintenance fee required under &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;5
and 3833.1&hyph;6 of this title, may, at the expiration of the year, give such delinquent co-owner personal notice
of this failure. This notice must be given in writing, or such notice may be given by publication in the newspaper published
nearest the claim for at least once a week for 90 days. If, upon the expiration of 90 days, after such notice in writing,
or upon the expiration of 180 days after the first newspaper publication of notice, the delinquent co-owner shall
have failed to contribute the proportionate share of such expenditures or improvements, such interest in the claim
by law passes to his co-owners who have made the expenditures or improvements as aforesaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A claimant alleging ownership of a forfeited interest under paragraph (a) above who requests the authorized officer
to change the ownership records of the affected mining claims shall present the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

failed to contribute his proper proportion within the period fixed by the statute, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evidence of personal service of the notice of delinquency upon the delinquent party. If personal service is effected
by mail, the minimum sufficient evidence shall consist of a copy of the notice and a copy of the return receipt of the
U.S. Postal Service evidencing receipt by the delinquent party of a registered or certified envelope containing
the notice. If service was made in person, an affidavit of service signed and dated on the date of service will suffice
as evidence of such service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In all cases, a signed and dated statement by the claimant that the delinquent co-owner failed to contribute his
proper proportion within the period fixed by the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Upon determination by the authorized officer that paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have been complied with,
the record title of the mining claim shall be changed pursuant to &sect;3833.3 of this title. Such a change in ownership
requires that the claimant submit the service charge required for a transfer of interest pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;4
of this title.
