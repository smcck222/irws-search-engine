SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 130 and Marketing Order No. 958, both as amended (7 CFR part 958),
regulating the handling of onions grown in designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon. The marketing
agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order now in effect Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the Idaho-Eastern
Oregon onion marketing order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued
herein will be applicable to all assessable onions during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period which begins July 1, 1994,
and ends June 30, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 450 producers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions under the marketing order and approximately
35 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion producers and handlers may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Onion Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a
rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on March 22, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $1,020,039, $10,161 less
than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $154 for research and $18,500 for promotion and
advertising, will be offset by decreases of $18,495 for salary expenses and $10,320 for travel and office expenses.
Major expense items include $113,785 for salary expenses, $57,600 for travel and office expenses, $60,154 for research,
$668,500 for promotion and advertising, $60,000 for export, and $50,000 for contingencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 8,000,000 hundredweight, will yield $800,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $30,000 in interest income and $190,039 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be
adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, estimated
at $898,928, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past
years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 950 producers of Oregon and Washington filberts/hazelnuts under this marketing order,
and approximately 21 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Oregon and Washington filbert/hazelnut
producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was prepared by the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Board are producers and handlers of filberts/hazelnuts. They are familiar with the Board's needs
and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget.
The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity
to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the expected quantity
of assessable filberts/hazelnuts handled. Because that rate will be applied to the actual quantity of filberts/hazelnuts,
it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Board's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a mail vote conducted the week of March 28, 1994, the Board unanimously recommended a 1993&hyph;94 budget of $507,010,
$97,215 more than the previous year. The major budget item is $250,000 for the Board's promotion program to maintain
and expand markets for filberts/hazelnuts. This is $30,000 more than budgeted last year for promotion. Other increases
include $2,865 for general and administrative expenses, $1,350 for furniture, $1,000 for a crop survey, $20,000
for research, and $42,000 for the emergency reserve fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.007 per pound, the same as last year. This rate, when
applied to anticipated shipments of 56,000,000 pounds, will yield $392,000 in assessment income. This, along with
$28,000 from previously unassessed 1993 crop filberts, $6,000 in interest income, and $81,010 from the Board's authorized
reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 marketing
year, estimated at $453,673, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one marketing year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the

 because: (1) The Board needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the marketing year begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the marketing
year apply to all assessable filberts/hazelnuts handled during the marketing year; (3) handlers are aware of this
action which was unanimously recommended by the Board in a mail vote and is similar to other budget actions issued in
past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will
be considered prior to finalization of this action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures for administration and indemnification, establishes an assessment
rate, and authorizes continuation of an indemnification reserve under Marketing Agreement 146 (agreement) for
the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. This rule also increases the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop
year. Authorization of this budget enables the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) to incur operating
expenses, collect funds to pay those expenses, and settle indemnification claims during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year.
Authorization of the increase in the administrative assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year enables the Committee
to collect sufficient funds to pay expenses projected for the remainder of that year. Funds to administer this program
are derived from assessments on handlers who have signed the agreement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement 146 (7 CFR part 998) regulating the quality of domestically produced
peanuts. This agreement is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.
601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12887, Civil Justice Reform. Under the agreement
now in effect, peanut handlers signatory to the agreement are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the peanut
agreement program are derived from such assessments, and deductible type insurance for 1994&hyph;95 indemnification
expenses. This rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Committee for the crop year
beginning July 1, 1994, and increases the administrative assessment rate for the crop year which began July 1, 1993.
This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge
to the provisions of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 47,000 producers of peanuts in the 16 States covered under the agreement, and approximately
76 handlers regulated under the agreement. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of the producers may be classified
as small entities, and some of the handlers covered under the agreement are small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the agreement, the assessment rate for a particular crop year applies to all assessable tonnage handled from
the beginning of such year (i.e., July 1). An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to
the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of peanuts. They are familiar
with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel for program operations and, thus,
are in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed at industry-wide meetings.
Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to provide input in recommending the budget, assessment
rate, and indemnification reserve. The handlers of peanuts who are directly affected have signed the marketing agreement
authorizing the expenses that may be incurred and the imposition of assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year was derived by dividing anticipated
expenses by expected receipts and acquisitions of farmers' stock peanuts. It applies to all assessable peanuts received
or acquired by handlers from July 1, 1994. Because that rate is applied to actual receipts and acquisitions, it must
be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 crop year administrative expenses
of $1,056,000 and an administrative assessment rate of $0.60 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts received
or acquired by handlers. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 crop year budgeted administrative expenditures were $1,020,000,
and the administrative assessment rate was initially recommended and fixed at $0.60 per ton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94
(in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $140,146 ($134,304), clerical salaries, $132,500 ($127,479), field
representatives salaries, $290,420 ($278,778), field representatives travel, $110,000 ($107,000), insurance
and bonds, $8,500 ($7,500), and furniture and equipment, $9,500 ($4,000). Items which have decreased compared to
those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Payroll taxes, $43,000 ($45,000), office rent and parking,
$50,000 ($52,500), postage and mailing, $12,000 ($13,000), and audit fees, $9,200 ($9,500). All other items are
budgeted at last year's amounts. The administrative budget includes $14,234 for contingencies ($4,439 last year).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended 1994 crop indemnification claims payments of up to $9,000,000 and an
indemnification assessment of $2.00 per net ton of farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers to continue
its indemnification program. The 1993&hyph;94 crop year indemnification assessment was $1.00 per net ton. Because
of the high number of claims being processed during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year, the Committee recommended a higher
assessment rate so that sufficient reserve funds will be available. The $9,000,000 of indemnification claims coverage
to be provided on 1994 crop peanuts includes $5,000,000 in excess loss insurance to be purchased by the Committee_the
same as last year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of the indemnification insurance premium and the costs to carry out indemnification procedures (sampling
and testing of 2&hyph;AB and 3&hyph;AB Subsamples, and crushing supervision, of indemnified peanuts, pursuant
to &sect;998.200 (c), are additional indemnification costs which must be authorized and paid from available indemnification
funds. Such costs are not expected to exceed $2,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total assessment rate is $2.60 per ton of assessable peanuts ($0.60 for administrative and $2.00 for indemnification).
Assessments are due on the 15th of the month following the month in which the farmers' stock peanuts are received or
acquired. Application of the recommended rates to the estimated assessable tonnage of 1,760,000 will yield $1,056,000
for program administration and $3,520,000 for indemnification. The indemnification amount, when added to expected
cash carry over from 1993&hyph;94 indemnification operations of $12,609,100, will provide $16,129,100, which
should be adequate for the 1994 fund, and to maintain an adequate reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993&hyph;94 budget was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an interim final rule on June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32600), and finalized on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43066). The administrative
expenses and assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year were based on an estimated assessable tonnage of 1,700,000.
Due to an unexpected short crop, the assessable tonnage is estimated to be only 1,476,377. In order to have sufficient
revenue to cover budgeted expenses of $1,020,000, the Committee unanimously recommended that the 1993&hyph;94
crop year administrative assessment be increased from $0.60 to $0.70 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers signatory to the agreement. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these
costs will be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing agreement. Therefore,
the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and Rural Development Administration (RDA) are amending the regulations
for the Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) to raise the loan limit. This action is needed to allow intermediaries
that have received and successfully used the maximum amount of IRP loans allowed by the current regulations, and have
need for additional funds, to be eligible to apply for such additional funds. The amendment is intended to raise the
maximum outstanding IRP indebtedness of an intermediary to $4 million, from the current limit of $2 million.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulatory package is an agency initiative to make the IRP more effective at stimulating rural community economic
development. The current regulation prohibits approval of any IRP loan that would result in any one intermediary
having an outstanding IRP indebtedness exceeding $2,000,000. RDA is still not encouraging initial loans of more
that $2,000,000. However, some intermediaries have received and reloaned $2,000,000 and have demand for additional
funding to meet the needs of the communities they serve. The primary reason for this action is to allow subsequent loans
to those successful intermediaries that have reached the current limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall
be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, FmHA/RDA
is making this action effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without securing prior public comment. It would be contrary to the public interest to wait for public comments before
implementing an increase in loan ceiling. There is an immediate need to provide funds to the public to help alleviate
severe economic hardship which exists in many rural areas as the result of high unemployment and poverty level wages.
Numerous intermediaries now exist that have received the maximum of $2 million, have successfully used all of the
funds to assist rural businesses, and have urgent need for additional loan funds. These intermediaries have proven
their ability to play a major and successful role in stimulating the economy and developing jobs in rural areas with
high unemployment and depressed economies. Increasing the IRP loan ceiling quickly will allow them to receive additional
IRP funds and continue to provide urgently needed assistance to businesses in their service areas. Delaying action
will deprive them of needed funding. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication and, if appropriate,
adjustments will be made in the regulation based on the comments.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending our regulations by removing Portugal from the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy
exists. Portugal had been added to the list in December 1993 after the disease was diagnosed in cattle in that country.
We are now removing Portugal from the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy exists because epidemiological
investigations have revealed that the cattle in which the disease was detected had been imported into Portugal from
Great Britain, and that all suspect animals were destroyed. This action will relieve certain prohibitions or restrictions
on the importation of certain fresh, chilled, and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts
derived from ruminants that have been in Portugal.

products, animal byproducts, hay, and straw into the United States in order to prevent the introduction of various
animal diseases, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSE is a neurological disease of bovine animals and other ruminants. The disease is not known to be contagious. The
major means of spread of BSE appears to be through the use of ruminant feed containing protein and other products from
ruminants infected with BSE. Therefore, BSE could become established in the United States if materials carrying
the BSE agent, such as certain meat, animal products, or animal byproducts derived from ruminants in countries in
which BSE exists, were imported into the United States and fed to ruminants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 94.18 and 95.4 of the regulations prohibit or restrict the importation of certain meat, animal products,
and animal byproducts derived from ruminants that have been in countries in which BSE exists, and &sect;96.2(b) prohibits
the importation of ruminant casings from countries in which BSE exists. Those countries are listed in &sect;94.18
of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In an interim rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65103&hyph;65104, Docket No. 93&hyph;149&hyph;1) and effective on December 7, 1993,
we amended the regulations by adding Portugal to the list of countries where BSE exists after the disease was detected
in cattle in Portugal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning the interim rule for a 60-day comment period ending February 11, 1994. We received
three comments by that date, all of which opposed the interim rule. The comments were sent by a representative of a U.S.
trade association, a U.S. manufacturer, and a representative of the Commission of the European Communities. Two
of the commenters opposed the interim rule because of its effect on the importation of certain animal products from
Portugal; the third commenter urged us to consider updated information regarding Portugal's epidemiological investigation
of the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A report from the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture to the Office of International Epizootics and the European Economic
Union stated that BSE had been detected in one cow and suspected in three other cows, all of which had been imported into
Portugal from Great Britain, where BSE is known to exist. This report led to our December 1993 interim rule adding Portugal
to the list of countries where BSE is known to exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent epidemiological investigations conducted by Portuguese veterinary officials revealed that the infected
animal, an 8-year-old Holstein-Friesian cow, was born in Great Britain in 1984 and imported into Portugal from Great
Britain in 1987. The affected cow and the three suspect cows were destroyed and the premises placed under quarantine
and official control throughout the epidemiological investigation. There have been no reports of any additional
animals in Portugal being affected with BSE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of their investigation, Portuguese veterinary officials established that no rendered products of
animal origin were ever imported for animal feed. In February 1990, the Portuguese Government prohibited the importation
of live cattle and all raw materials and byproducts of animal origin from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the
Republic of Ireland. Additionally, all livestock in Portugal, both domestic and imported, are subject to official
supervision and veterinary controls established at the national level. These veterinary controls include an official
registry system, animal identification, and monitoring of all animal movement. Diagnostic capabilities for BSE
are available at national veterinary laboratories in Lisbon and Porto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the comments received, on the epidemiological information provided by Portuguese veterinary
officials, and on the results of our continuing study of the situation described in the December 1993 interim rule,
we are removing Portugal from the list of countries where BSE is known to exist.

Prompt implementation is needed to relieve unnecessary restrictions on the importation of certain fresh, chilled,
and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts derived from ruminants that have been in
Portugal. With these restrictions lifted, U.S. importers will be able to resume their importation of the animal products
and animal byproducts described above. Portuguese producers and exporters that had been denied these U.S. markets
by our December 1993 interim rule will be able to resume their business with the United States.

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this rule will not have a significant economic impact. The December 1993 interim rule that placed
Portugal on the list of countries in which BSE exists had the effect of restricting the importation of some animal products
and prohibiting the importation of others. Natural sausage casings were the only affected commodity that had been
imported from Portugal in quantities sufficient to cause any economic impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will remove the prohibition on the importation of natural sausage casings of ruminant origin from Portugal.
About 20 small U.S. entities had been importing natural sausage casings from Portugal prior to the December 1993 interim
rule. None of the companies had been totally dependent on Portugal for sausage casings, as Portugal supplied only
2.5 percent of natural sausage casings imported into the United States. This rule will have a negligible economic
impact on these small entities. Additionally, price and competition in the United States will not be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 8, 1993, the Corporation proposed regulations setting forth procedures to be used in requesting access
to and responding to requests for Corporation records. See 58 FR 59210. Essentially, the Corporation proposed regulations
that provided that all requests for access to Corporation records must be in writing, adequately describe the material
sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia. The proposed regulations delegated to the Freedom of Information
Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning requests for access to records, and provided procedures
for final Corporation decisions on administrative appeals. The proposed regulations also recited the statutory
bases for exemption from disclosure and provided that any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be produced
as provided by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA). The proposed regulations provided a fee structure
consistent with the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management
and Budget on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012). The proposed regulations also set forth factors to be considered in determining
whether to waive or reduce fees. Consistent with Executive Order 12600 published on June 23, 1987, pertaining to access
to certain information submitted to an agency, the proposed regulations provided that, upon receipt of a request
for possibly confidential commercial or financial information which may be protected from disclosure under FOIA
exemption (b)(4), the Corporation shall notify the submitter and provide an opportunity to comment on possible disclosure.
The Corporation did not receive any comments in response to the proposed regulations. The Corporation now adopts
12 CFR part 1402 as a final regulation without any revision.

Requests for records shall be in writing, in an envelope clearly marked ``FOIA Request,'' and addressed to the Freedom
of Information Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;0826. A request
improperly addressed will be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 10-day time period set forth in &sect;1402.14(a)
until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by the Freedom of Information Officer.
Records requested in conformance with this subpart and which are not exempt records may be received in person or by
mail as specified in the request. Records to be received in person will be available for inspection or copying during
business hours on a regular business day in the offices of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia
22102&hyph;0826.

Response to requests for records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided
in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of a request, the Freedom of Information Officer shall determine whether
to comply with or to deny such request and place a notice thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 30 days of the receipt of a notice denying, in whole or in part, a request for records, the requester may appeal
the denial. The appeal shall be in writing addressed to the Chief Financial Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation, and both the letter and envelope shall be clearly marked ``FOIA Appeal.'' An appeal improperly addressed
shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 20-day time period set forth in paragraph (c) of this section
until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided
in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of an appeal, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall act
upon the appeal and place a notice of the determination thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. If
the determination on the appeal upholds in whole or in part the denial of the request for records, or, if a determination
on the appeal has not been mailed at the end of the 20-day period or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed
to have exhausted that person's administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the
United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When a determination cannot be mailed within the applicable time
limit, the appeal will nevertheless be processed. In such case, upon the expiration of the time limit, the requester
will be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be mailed, and of
that person's right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to forego judicial review until determination
of the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In unusual circumstances as specified in this paragraph the 10-day time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this
section or the 20-day time limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or both, may be extended provided that
the total of all extensions shall not exceed 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Extensions
shall be made by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination
is expected to be mailed. As used in this paragraph,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means, but only to the extent necessary to the proper processing of the request: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are
separate from the office processing the request; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records
which are demanded in a single request; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial
interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation
having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

Business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Business information provided to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation by a business submitter shall
not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section. The requirements
of this section shall not apply if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation determines that the information should not be disclosed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Business information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any person or entity which provides business information to the government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requester
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the person or entity making the Freedom of Information Act request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) The Freedom of Information Officer shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a business submitter with
prompt written notice of a request encompassing its business information whenever required under paragraph (d)
of this section. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide
copies of the records or portions thereof containing the business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever the Freedom of Information Officer provides a business submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section, the Freedom of Information Officer shall notify the requester that the request includes information
that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and that the person or entity who submitted the
information to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has been given the opportunity to comment on the proposed
disclosure of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall provide a business submitter with notice of a request whenever:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as commercially or financially sensitive
information; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has reason to believe that the disclosure of the information may
result in commercial or financial injury to the business submitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notice of a request for business information falling within paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall be required
for a period of not more than 10 years after the date of submission unless the business submitter requests and provides
acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whenever possible, the business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification
by an officer or authorized representative of the business submitter that the information in question is in fact a
trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Through the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall,
to the extent permitted by law, afford a business submitter a reasonable period within which it can provide the Farm
Credit System Insurance Corporation with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall
specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and,
in the case of the exemption provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), shall demonstrate why the information is contended to
be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided
by a business submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall consider carefully a business submitter's objections
and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever
the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation decides to disclose business information over the objection of a business
submitter, the Freedom of Information Officer shall forward to the business submitter a written notice which shall
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A specified disclosure date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The notice of intent to disclose required by this paragraph shall be sent, to the extent permitted by law, within
a reasonable number of days prior to the specified date upon which disclosure is intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Freedom of Information Officer shall send a copy of such disclosure notice to the requester at the same time
the notice is sent to the business submitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information covered by paragraph (d)
of this section, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall promptly notify the business submitter of such
action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commercial use request
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a request for information that is from or on behalf of an individual or entity seeking information for a use or
purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or on whose behalf the request is
being made. To determine whether a request is properly classified as a commercial use request, the Farm Credit System
Insurance Corporation shall determine the purpose for which the documents requested will be used. If the Farm Credit
System Insurance Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the purpose specified in the request, for which a requester
will use the records sought, or where the purpose is not clear from the request itself, the Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specified category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct costs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means those expenditures the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation actually incurs in searching for and reproducing
documents to respond to a request for information. In the case of a commercial use request, the term also means those
expenditures the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation actually incurs in reviewing documents to respond to
the request. The direct cost shall include the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the
employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating reproduction equipment. Not included
in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records
are stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education,
an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational
education that operates a program or programs of scholarly research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncommercial scientific institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial, trade, or profit basis and that is operated solely for
the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product
or industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Representative of the news media
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news
to the public. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
news
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news
media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals
(but only in those instances when the periodicals can qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make their products
available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.
As traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunication
services), such alternative media would be included in this category. ``Freelance'' journalists may be regarded
as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization
even though they are not actually employed by the organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof
that a journalist is working for a news organization, but the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may look to
a requester's past publication record to determine whether a journalist is working for a news organization.

 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reproduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mean the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a request for information. Such copies take the
form of paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape
or disk), among others. The copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the process of examining documents located in response to a request for information to determine whether any
portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure
(e.g., doing all that is necessary to prepare the documents for release). The term review does not include the time
spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. The Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation shall only charge fees for reviewing documents in response to a commercial use request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Search
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request for information, including page-by-page
or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searching for material shall be done in the most efficient
and least expensive manner so as to minimize the costs of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation and the requester.
For example, a line-by-line search for responsive material should not be performed when merely reproducing an entire
document would be the less expensive and the faster method of complying with a request for information. Searches may
be done manually or by computer using existing programming. A ``search'' for material that is responsive to a request
should be distinguished from a ``review'' of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by or on behalf of educational
institutions and noncommercial scientific institutions in an amount which equals the cost of reproducing the documents
responsive to the request, excluding the costs of reproducing the first 100 pages. For a request to be included in this
category, requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying
institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research
(if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific research (if the request is from a noncommercial
scientific institution). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by representatives of the
news media in an amount which equals the cost of reproducing the documents responsive to the request, excluding the
costs of reproducing the first 100 pages. For a request to be included in this category, the requester must qualify
as a representative of the news media and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting
the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by persons or entities making
a commercial use request in an amount that equals the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing for release, and
reproducing the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to 2 hours of free search time nor 100 free
pages of reproduction of documents. In accordance with &sect;1402.26, commercial use requesters may be charged
the costs of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by persons or entities that
are not classified in any of the categories listed in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section in an amount that equals
the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, excluding
the first 2 hours of search time and the cost of reproducing the first 100 pages of records. In accordance with &sect;1402.26,
requesters in this category may be charged the cost of searching for records even if there is ultimately no disclosure
of records, excluding the first 2 hours of search time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For purposes of the exceptions contained in this section on assessment of fees, the word 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pages
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to paper copies of ``81/2 &times; 11'' or ``11 &times; 14.'' Thus, requesters are not entitled to 100 microfiche
or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or a computer disk containing
the equivalent of 100 pages of computer printout meets the terms of the exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
search time 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has as its basis, manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation
will determine the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent
of that rate. When the cost of search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process
a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of 2 hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the
operator, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will begin assessing charges for computer search.

Fees to be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Generally, the fees charged for requests for records shall cover the full allowable direct costs of searching
for, reproducing, and reviewing documents that are responsive to a request for information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Manual searches for records will be charged at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent of that rate)
of the employee(s) making the search. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Computer searches for records will be charged at the actual direct cost of providing the service. This will include
the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable
to searching for records and the operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. A charge shall also be made
for any substantial amounts of special supplies or materials used to contain, present, or make available the output
of computers, based upon the prevailing levels of costs to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation for the type
and amount of such supplies of materials that are used. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to entitle any
person or entity, as a right, to any services in connection with computerized records, other than services to which
such person or entity may be entitled under the provisions of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to
determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for the initial review;
i.e., the review undertaken the first time the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation analyzes the applicability
of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full
under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability
of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review is assessable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Records will be reproduced at a rate of $.15 per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts,
the requester shall be charged the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For
other methods of reproduction, the actual direct costs of producing the document(s) shall be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will recover the full costs of providing services such as those enumerated
below when it elects to provide them: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Certifying that records are true copies; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a
postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may grant a waiver or reduction of fees if the Farm Credit System Insurance
Corporation determines that the disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, and the disclosure of the
information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

(b) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use
requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. The elements to be considered
in determining the ``cost of collecting a fee'' are the administrative costs of receiving and recording a requester's
remittance and processing the fee.

(a) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable will amount to more than $25 and the requester has not indicated
in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified of the amount
of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof that can be readily estimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the anticipated fees exceed $250 and if the requester has a history of promptly paying fees charged in connection
with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may obtain satisfactory assurances that
the requester will fully pay the fees anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the anticipated fees exceed $250 and if the requester has no history of paying fees charged in connection with
information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may require an advance payment of fees in an amount
up to the full amount anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged within 30 days of the date of a billing for fees charged
in connection with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may require the requester
to pay the fees owed, plus interest, or demonstrate that the full amount owed has been paid, and require the requester
to make an advance payment of the full amount of the fees anticipated before processing a new request or a pending request
from that requester. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The notice of the amount of an anticipated fee or a request for an advance deposit shall include an offer to the requester
to confer with identified Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation personnel to attempt to reformulate the request
in a manner which will meet the needs of the requester at a lower cost.

The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may begin charging interest on unpaid fees, starting on the 31st day

by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, even if said payment has not been processed. Interest will accrue
at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31, United States Code, and will accrue from the day on which the bill
for such fees was sent.

The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may assess charges for time spent searching for records on behalf of
requesters in the categories provided for in &sect;1402.21 (c) and (d), even if there are no records that are responsive
to the request or there is ultimately no disclosure of records. The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may assess
charges for time spent reviewing records for requesters in the category provided for in &sect;1402.21(c) even if
the records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely
in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation reasonably believes that a requester,
or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose
of evading the assessment of fees, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may aggregate any such requests and
charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period
over which the requests have occurred.

In the Federal Register of February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7635; corrected February 22, 1994 (59 FR 8507)), FDA amended 21 CFR
74.1340 and 21 CFR 74.2340 to provide for the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake for coloring
drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA gave interested persons until March 18, 1994, to file objections or requests for a hearing. The agency received
no objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA concludes that the final rule published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12710 of April 5, 1990, 3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 282, terminated the national emergency declared on April
8, 1988, with respect to Panama, and lifted sanctions imposed against the Noriega regime. Pursuant to section 207(a)(2)
of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1706(a)(2), however, the order continued the blocking
of certain Government of Panama assets in the United States, with the understanding of the Government of Panama, to
facilitate resolution of claims of U.S. persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To foster the resolution of U.S. persons' claims against the Government of Panama arising prior to the April 5, 1990
lifting date, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury (``FAC''), is amending the Panamanian
Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 565 (the ``Regulations'') to include a statement of licensing policy announcing
that the release of blocked Government of Panama assets may be licensed at the request of that government to satisfy
settlements, final judgments and arbitral awards in favor of U.S. persons, where the claims arose prior to April 5,
1990. In addition, FAC will accept license applications from U.S. persons seeking judicial orders of attachment
against blocked Government of Panama assets in satisfaction of final judgments entered in favor of the applicants
with respect to such claims against the Government of Panama, provided such applications are submitted no later that
June 15, 1994. The term ``Government of Panama'' for these purposes is defined in &sect;565.303 of the Regulations,
including appendix A to part 565.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Procedures for specific license applications are set forth in &sect;565.801 of the Regulations. Unlicensed transfers
of blocked Government of Panama assets, including transfers pursuant to judicial order, are prohibited and are null
and void as provided in &sect;&sect;565.201 and 565.204. Violations of this part are punishable by criminal and civil
penalties as provided in &sect;&sect;565.701 through 565.705.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards and reduce the emission of air toxics.
Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations
and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements
on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program (SBAP), and submit this program as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition,
the CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation.
The requirements for establishing an SBAP are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions, and as a tool to provide
further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state of Kansas has submitted an SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order
to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following program elements: (1) The establishment
of an SBAP to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small
Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation
of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Small Business Assistance Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements (a seventh requirement, establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed
in the next section) that the state must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Specifically, these elements are: (1) Developing,
collecting, and coordinating information exchange on compliance methods and control technologies; (2) providing
assistance to small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and
detection; (3) providing assistance for determining applicable requirements under the Act and permit issuance;
(4) determining adequate mechanisms for notifying small business stationary sources of their right under the Act
on a timely basis; (5) determining adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including a program for referring sources to qualified auditors, or for the state to provide
for such audits to determine compliance with this Act; and (6) procedures for considering requests from small business
stationary sources for modifications of work practices, or technological methods of compliance or compliance procedures.
The SBAP services will be provided by a consortium of three state universities: the University of Kansas' Center for
Environmental Education and Training within the Division of Continuing Education; Kansas State University's Industrial
Extension Service, a program of the College of Engineering and the Cooperative Extension Service; and Wichita State
University's Center for Technology Application. The SBAP will provide information and/or compliance and technical
assistance relevant to each of the six elements above. Additional information concerning individual responsibilities
of the consortium members is contained in the technical support document, which is part of the docket for this rulemaking
and which is available from the EPA office listed above. The SBAP has been operational since October 1, 1993. The SBAP
consortium's contract with KDHE will be renewed yearly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ombudsman
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The Ombudsman position has been designated in the Office of Science and Support of the KDHE. This position
was filled on November 18, 1993. The Ombudsman will have direct access to the Secretary (program manager) of the KDHE,
to the director of the Division of the Environment of the KDHE, the manager of the air pollution control program, and
other state agencies as necessary to perform the functions of its office independently of the air pollution regulatory
and enforcement programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e) requires the state to establish a CAP that must include two members selected by the Governor who are
not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are
owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the
Air Pollution Permit Program. The state has met this requirement. All members of the CAP have been appointed in accordance
with the provisions of section 507(e). The CAP held its initial meeting on December 9, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act; (3) to review
and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and
disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The state has met these requirements by committing
the CAP to perform these functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legislative authority for the SBAP, CAP, and ombudsman was obtained during the 1993 legislative session and is contained
in the Kansas Air Quality Act, Section 15. All three programs are funded by air emissions fees, authority for which
is contained in section 8 of the Kansas Air Quality Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Two Additional Provisions Which the State Submittal Must Address Include Source Eligibility and Fee Reduction
Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c) allows states, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to extend the definition of eligible
source to include small business stationary sources which do not meet the criteria of subparagraphs (3), (4), or (5)
of section 507(c), but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state submittal specifies that upon petition by a source, the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for public
comment, may include as a small business stationary source, any source which does not meet the criteria of subparagraphs
(3), (4), or (5) of section 507(c), but which does not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants. This conforms
to the requirements of section 507(c) and is acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the state submittal provides that the Secretary may exclude from the small business stationary source definition
any category or subcategory of sources that the Administrator of EPA determines to have sufficient technical and
financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without the application of this program, as provided by
section 507 (c)(3)(A) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and the Small Business Administration, and after providing
notice and opportunity for public hearing, may exclude from the small business stationary source definition under
this section, any category or subcategory of sources that the Secretary determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act without the application of this subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(b) allows states flexibility to reduce permit fees to take into account the financial resources of small
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under state statute, the Secretary may reduce any fee required by the Act for any classification of small business
source to take into account the financial resources of such classification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The state has submitted an SIP revision implementing or committing to implement each of the required SBAP elements
required by section 507 of the CAA. The KDHE has contracted with a consortium of state universities to implement the
small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program. The Ombudsman position
has been established within the KDHE and the position has been filled. The CAP has been appointed and has met. The state
submittal meets in full the requirements of section 507 of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the state of Kansas. The state has submitted an SIP revision implementing
each of the required program elements required by section 507 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 11, 1994 unless, by June 13, 1994, notice is
received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents.
One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the
action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action
will be effective July 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted
a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal/state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) is to include the lead nonattainment
areas into the existing new source review (NSR) program. This revision changes the applicability requirements by
changing the definition of nonattainment area in the state regulations to include lead nonattainment areas, and
to delete the Kansas City area as a nonattainment area in light of its attainment of the ozone standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On February 4, 1994, EPA proposed a rulemaking to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing
Missouri NSR program. The objective of this final rulemaking is to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment
areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri. This SIP revision contains the amendments to the SIP defining three
areas in Missouri as nonattainment for lead. This SIP revision is also being accorded limited approval because it
does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As of April 6, 1994, Missouri submitted NSR provisions intended to address the limited approval, and EPA is currently
reviewing this latest submittal. The limited approval strengthens the existing SIP as representing an improvement
over what is currently in the SIP, and as meeting some of the applicable requirements of the Act. In particular, the
amendment means that Missouri's NSR requirements, which meet all of the provisions of the preamended Act, apply to
new and modified sources of lead in the nonattainment areas.

EPA may grant such a limited approval under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, in light of the general authority delegated

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1978, when EPA promulgated the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard, it was not authorized to designate areas
nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA was authorized
to require states to designate areas as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. On November 6, 1991,
at 56 FR 56694, EPA designated the following areas as nonattainment for lead: the city of Herculaneum in Jefferson
County; and the Dent, Liberty and Arcadia townships in Iron County. No comments were received in response to the proposal.

In this document, EPA takes final action on the rulemaking to provide limited approval of the incorporation of three
Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal/state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. At 10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, that land not selected by the State under the provisions of the Statehood Act will be opened
to such forms of disposition as may be law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under
the United States mining laws. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws
prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted
adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish
a location and to initiate a right to possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The
Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress
has provided for such determinations in local courts.

5. A portion of the area affected by this order is public land, and has been and will remain subject to overlapping Public
Land Order Nos. 396, 587, 2667, or 2791, and the terms and conditions of those Public Land Orders remain otherwise unchanged
by this order.

the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation
of any of the lands described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is
unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988),
shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession
are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in
disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local
courts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood
insurance is now available for property in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes three additional permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatee (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichechus manatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) sanctuaries and expands an existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuary in Kings Bay, Crystal River, Florida. All waterborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities will be prohibited in these sanctuaries from November 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through March 31 of each year. This final action will prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking of manatees by harassment resulting from waterborne activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the winter months. The total number of sanctuaries in Kings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay is increased from three (10.7 acres) to six (39.0 acres) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the growing number of manatees using the area each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winter, and to offset the harassment from increasing public use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is taken under the authority of the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1972.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystal River is a short tidal river on the west coast of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida. Forming the headwaters of Crystal River is Kings Bay, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lake-like body of water fed by many freshwater springs. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
springs, because of their year-round temperature of over 74
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an essential warm-water wintering area for West Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichechus manatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a federally listed endangered species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During cold weather, many of the manatees wintering in Kings Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
congregate in an area known as the main spring or Kings Spring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located just south of Banana Island. This location is also a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favorite site for skin and scuba divers, who come to Kings Bay for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the clear, calm conditions favorable for learning diving techniques, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with the opportunity to ``swim with the manatees''. Diver use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this area is especially heavy during the cold winter months when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diving is impractical through most of the northern states, and when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity for manatee encounters is greatest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concurrent use of the main spring area by divers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees during cold weather creates a problem for manatees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manatees are shy, harmless creatures that are easily driven away from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm springs by human activity (Buckingham 1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A limited number of manatees (about 15) used the springs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970's prior to the establishment of the Banana Island Sanctuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They seemed to tolerate and even enjoy some human contact. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tame'' manatees readily approached divers and allowed themselves to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be petted and lightly scratched (Hartman 1979, Powell and Rathbun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984). By 1980, the number of manatees wintering in the bay had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased to just over 100. This increase was greater than could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounted for by reproduction, so it was apparent that some manatees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were immigrating from other areas (Powell and Rathbun 1984). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of manatees that chose to interact with the public increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only slightly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern for the welfare of the manatees in Kings Bay increased, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culminating in 1980 when the first manatee sanctuaries were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established. The authority to establish manatee protection areas, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either refuges or sanctuaries, is provided by the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codified at 50 CFR 17, Subpart J. Under Subpart J, the Director may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish, by regulation, manatee protection areas whenever he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines there is substantial evidence that there is imminent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger of a taking (including harassment) of one or more manatees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that such establishment is necessary to prevent such a taking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation allows the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to regulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in state waters to protect an endangered species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983 the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge was created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect manatees from any potential negative impacts of human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. The refuge owns Banana Island, Warden Key and Buzzard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Island in Kings Bay, a house on the eastern shore currently being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as the headquarters, and some other properties in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manatee use of Kings Bay during winter months now exceeds 240 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals (FWS unpublished data). A majority of manatees currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the spring do not tolerate close human contact and leave the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warmer spring waters when humans approach too closely. Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted during the 1988&hyph;89 winters indicated manatees spend a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disproportionate amount of their time in sanctuaries, in direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship to the number of boats present, regardless of weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions (Buckingham 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts have been made to make divers, snorklers, and boaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware of the manatee harassment problem. Visitors have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructed through posters, brochures, and by dive shop personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they should not aggressively pursue manatees or drive them from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the springs. Most visitors to King's Bay have been very cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this regard. While most visitors conscientiously avoid outright 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harassment, many seek the manatees out, approaching them to observe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and even pet them. Although a few manatees tolerate and occasionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invite attention, most appear to find these interactions intolerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and alter their behavior accordingly. At times, the large number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans concentrated in this relatively confined area forces all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees to seek less disturbing conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest manatee aggregations on Florida's west coast are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found during winter months on the ledges surrounding the refuge's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main spring. Manatees often collect there in the evenings and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the early morning hours. When few divers are present and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those few are quiet, manatees usually linger around the main boil, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly in colder weather. However, on days when divers arrive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in force soon after sunrise, those manatees least able to tolerate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human crowding begin leaving the spring and move into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries. As greater numbers of divers arrive, more manatees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave (FWS unpublished data). On days when the temperatures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding waters are not excessively cold, this may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical, although it still alters the manatee's natural behavior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On days when surrounding water temperatures are below 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presents a potentially serious problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although some manatees can tolerate limited exposure to waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as cold as 56.3
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (13.5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C) (Hartman, 1979) others become lethargic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cease feeding at temperatures less than in 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (20
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C) water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Campbell and Irvine 1981). Carcasses recovered following major cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events showed atrophy of fat, emaciation, and an absence of food in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the gastrointestinal tract with no sign of disease; characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with death from hypothermia. Manatees appear unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase heat production through metabolic activity sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counter losses to the environment. Manatees are tropical warm-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mammals. They feed on low-energy forage and have high thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conductance and exceptionally low metabolic rates (only 15 to 22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of predicted values based on body size) (Irvine 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida is at the northern limit of their winter range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subadult manatees appear to be especially susceptible to death 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from hypothermia. This is probably a combination of their larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface to volume ratio and their lack of experience in finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal refuges. The length of time a manatee can tolerate cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water before its health is compromised depends on its condition_a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor which cannot easily be measured on free-ranging manatees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experiments on Amazonian manatees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. inunguis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) showed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underweight, nutritionally stressed, and fasting mammals have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drastically lowered capacity for heat production (Scrimshaw et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1968, Chandra and Newberne 1977:127&hyph;176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During an extreme cold event in 1990, several manatees died in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brevard County, Florida. These manatees sought thermal refuge at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm-water discharge from an electrical power generating plant on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banana River. Although the discharge raised the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water approximately 10
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, under those extreme conditions, it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient to keep them alive. There is probably no thermal refuge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Florida warm enough to guarantee the health of all resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees during an extremely cold winter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge is probably the best of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the thermal refuges and undoubtedly the only one capable of supplying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the needs for over 200 manatees through the winter. The springs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fed by underwater artesian springs deep under the insulating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface of the earth, holding the temperature constant. Unlike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial discharges, this natural water source is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical breakdowns or power failures. Unlike most artificial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuges, a readily available food source is available close by and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundant supply. Bengtson (1981) observed manatees remaining in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal refuges for up to a week without feeding during cold spells. It appears it was more energy efficient for them
to fast rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk feeding in colder waters. In Crystal River, fasting is probably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rarely necessary for long periods, and the enormous outflow from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
springs can moderate the temperature of much of the bay, depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tidal and wind factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If left alone, manatees would use the resources of Kings Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to their individual needs. However, research has shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the presence of boaters and divers causes manatees to leave the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring heads in favor of the sanctuaries regardless of weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. On days when there is low diver turnout, a greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportion of manatees remain in the springs (Buckingham 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Observations of other wintering areas, such as Blue Spring State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park, show that, left to their own devices, most manatees will remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in warm water throughout the day during cold weather periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities that cause manatees to leave a natural thermal refuge can, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, be considered ``harassment'' because those activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with normal ``sheltering'' habits of the animal. Harassment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manatees is a violation of both the Endangered Species Act and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marine Mammal Protection Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, manatees are able to move away from divers by going 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into three sanctuaries, Banana Island, Sunset Shores, and Magnolia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Springs, established in 1980. The Banana Island sanctuary is located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
near the main spring, Kings Spring, and is relatively warm in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to surrounding waters. Sunset Shores sanctuary is still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the southern part of the bay and provides a feeding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resting area in fairly warm water. The Magnolia Springs sanctuary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in a canal development adjacent to Kings Bay and contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller spring. Since 1980, the number of manatees using Kings Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has increased from 100 to 246 in 1990. Although it might appear from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increasing numbers of manatees that additional protection is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed, this is not the case. As manatee habitat is lost elsewhere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the Florida peninsula, Kings Bay is becoming more important. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kings Bay is one of the last 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
natural
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 warm-water areas with abundant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food resources. Additional sanctuaries are essential to insure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate undisturbed natural areas in Kings Bay where manatees may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet their needs, including warm water, food, and areas for resting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and socializing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic importance of Kings Bay and especially the refuge's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main spring to Crystal River and Citrus County centers around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational SCUBA diving, snorkeling and boating. The area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internationally known as a desirable location for winter diving. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of manatees creates a special attraction which dive shop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners exploit by advertising their facilities as a place where one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can ``swim with the manatees''. The tourism industry created by divers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coming to Crystal River is significant and total sales at five dive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shops and three motels more than doubled between 1980 and 1986, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``manatee season'' accounting for 28 to 53 percent of their sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the entire year (Milon in prep). Due in part to national and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international publicity manatees have received in recent years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of divers visiting Kings Bay has increased to about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60,000&hyph;80,000 in the winter of 1990&hyph;91, double the number in 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FWS unpublished data). This rapid increase in popularity is likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue, significantly affecting manatees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service intends to provide manatees needed winter protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without adversely affecting diving and other waterborne activities so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to Crystal River's economy. Aerial survey data available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on manatee distribution within Kings Bay suggest that strategically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed manatee sanctuaries could provide manatees warm-water refugia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and feeding and resting areas free from harassment without causing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major disruption of current recreational patterns (Kochman 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985, Buckingham 1990). It is important to note that, although a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local business people feared losses of revenue following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the sanctuary additions, no evidence of any losses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been observed during the 2 years the sanctuaries were in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under emergency rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Service, by this rule, is expanding the sanctuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area in Kings Bay to provide manatees additional undisturbed habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the cold weather months. These sanctuaries will exclude all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waterborne activities by humans from November 15 through March 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year. The total sanctuary area, consisting of less than 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the area of Kings Bay, allows the remaining 90 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bay to remain open to recreational and commercial waterborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. The sanctuary areas were carefully selected to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum protection for manatees and minimum impact on divers. Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input into the selection of sanctuary areas was obtained during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workshop held in Crystal River on March 21, 1991. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that, given these added refugia, manatees will not be forced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to leave the warm water necessary for their survival and will be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to feed, rest, and socialize without being harassed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sanctuary addition at Magnolia Springs adds 1.5 acres to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous Magnolia Springs Sanctuary. This short, horseshoe-shaped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of canal joins a canal that feeds directly into Kings Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition extends the protected area around a significant artesian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring within the original sanctuary, providing additional protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the small but consistent number of manatees, most notably cows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and calves, that use the area for giving birth, resting, and as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warm-water refuge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sanctuary on the north and east sides of Buzzard Island contains 18.0 acres of shallow grassbeds along the northwestern
edge and down the length of the east side of Buzzard Island. This area is primarily used by manatees as a feeding area.
It has limited value as a warm-water sanctuary but contains abundant vegetation within a short distance from the warm
waters in the southern part of Kings Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sanctuary at Tarpon Springs contains 4.6 acres along the northwestern side of Banana Island. This sanctuary contains
a small spring and is used by manatees as a thermal refuge, feeding, and resting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 4.0-acre sanctuary on the north side of Warden Key provides a protected feeding area close to the warm-water sanctuaries
in the south bay.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public workshop, advertised in the Citrus County Chronicle, was held on March 21, 1991 to allow local citizens and
other interested parties the opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of different sanctuary locations. A number
of the alternatives discussed at the workshop were described in the Service's draft Environmental Assessment supporting
the Finding of No Significant Impact that was approved by the Regional Director on August 23, 1991. The sanctuaries
as they appear in this rule were selected on the basis of known use by manatees, availability of resources, and minimal
impact on recreational use patterns and homeowners. These sanctuaries were implemented for two successive winters,
1991&hyph;2 and 1992&hyph;3, by two separate emergency rules (57 FR 5988 and 58 FR 5643) when completion of the rulemaking
process was delayed. Legal notices were published in the ``Citrus County Chronicle'' prior to the implementation
of the emergency rules, and each emergency rule offered the Environmental Assessment for review by members of the
public. The proposed rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28381), offered a public hearing, if requested, and announced a public comment period to end July
12, 1993. Following several requests for a public hearing, a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34556) to announce a hearing and extension of the comment period. The hearing was held July 15,
1993, at the Coastal Region Library in Crystal River and the comment period was extended until July 30, 1993, to allow
time for written comments to be received following the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the July 15, 1993, hearing, a clear majority of the verbal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and small minority of the written comments consisted of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements opposing either Federal regulations on recreational use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kings Bay and the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in general, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or the procedures used to implement the sanctuaries. Few people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the hearing addressed the sanctuary issue directly and there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several misconceptions as to what the rule would include. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed a fear that future regulations would either eliminate or so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discourage recreational boating that the local economy would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively impacted. Many speakers believed the preferences of local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizens and local political representatives should have been given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more weight. Others feared that future regulations would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing of the refuge, including the main spring. Although nearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every speaker expressed affection for, or at least acceptance of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manatees in Kings Bay, many believed manatee protection areas should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be implemented in Kings Bay if they interfered with their ``right'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use public waterways. A few people questioned the soundness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the decision to increase manatee protection, although most also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated they were not aware of or had not read the research study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports. Many were not aware that a public workshop had been held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early in the process and believed the final rule was already in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect. Although one person suggested redrawing one corner of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Buzzard Island Sanctuary to avoid funnelling boats into a narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channel, none of the negative commenters offered any alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to protect manatees from harassment and a few questioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there was any need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the proposed rule were provided at the hearing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear up some commonly held misconceptions. For example, a petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 230 legible signatures protested against ``the closing down of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kings Bay for the Manatees for a period of 8 months per year.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule would prohibit boats from only a small percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bay (the total sanctuary area comprises less than 10 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bay and leaves all the boating channels and the main spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
open), and because the period they would be in effect is only 41/2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months each year, it is likely these people had confused the dates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seasonal county speed zone regulations with the shorter sanctuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season. Others may have had the same misconception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive comments were in the minority at the hearing but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituted a large majority of written comments received. Unlike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing, which mostly represented only Citrus County residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the written comments came from Florida residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside Citrus County. Five letters were received from people who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spoke at the hearing and wished to reiterate or clarify their point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of view. One comment came from out-of-state. Of all the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, 74 individuals and 12 state and national organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including national and local chapters of the Audubon Society, Sierra 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Club, and the Humane Society, specifically stated they support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries. Many supporters suggested additional manatee protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was needed. One-third recommended a ban on night diving. Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended allowing only passive observation of manatees. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people favored expanding the sanctuaries system further either by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding a sanctuary south of Warden Key, extending the season to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier date, or creating corridors between sanctuaries. Emphasis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centered on the southern and eastern parts of the bay where manatee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregations are largest and most consistent. Save the Manatee Club 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Citrus County-based Friends of the Manatee proposed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-sharing plan that prohibited public use of the refuge (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the main spring) during extended cold periods based on air and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water temperatures. Friends of the Manatee also recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enlarging the Banana Island Sanctuary, implementing a boat-free, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swimming and diving area, and a diver-free manatee corridor between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries. Both organizations also recommended a ban on night 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diving and allowing only passive observation of manatees. There were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two recommendations for a permit system similar to that used in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuges to limit the number of divers using the refuge's main spring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many people on both sides of the sanctuary issue, expressed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for additional law enforcement effort to monitor not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctuaries, but the speed zones, and to prevent manatee harassment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by divers and snorklers. There was also a clear consensus that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intensive public education campaign would play a key role in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing intentional and unintentional harassment of manatees. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crystal River Chamber of Commerce appealed to the audience that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the outcome of the sanctuary issue, government, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation groups, and citizens should work together to educate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform the tens of thousands of visitors who visit the area each year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of how to interact with manatees in a safe and appropriate manner.

Although, there were a number of general comments opposing Federal regulation of recreational use of Kings Bay and
the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge and procedures used to implement the sanctuaries, very few people expressed
specific concerns about the sanctuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering all the comments received, the Service concludes that the additional sanctuaries are needed to
accommodate the increase in the number of manatees using the area each winter, and to offset harassment from increasing
public use and that no changes to the proposed rule are necessary or warranted. Additional sanctuaries are essential
to insure adequate undisturbed natural areas in Kings Bay where manatees meet their needs, including warm water,
food and areas for resting and socializing. The sanctuaries were carefully selected to provide maximum benefits
for manatees and minimum impact on human recreational activities in Kings Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in its 1993 Public Use Management Plan addressed many of the concerns of
those recommending additional manatee protection around the main spring by (1) expanding the Banana Island sanctuary
to coincide with the refuge boundary while establishing a ``swim only'' access corridor to the spring itself from
November 15 to March 31, (2) prohibiting accessing to the spring during night hours from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. during the winter,
and (3) coordinating commercial establishments catering to refuge visitors through a special use permit system
to ensure the consistency of visitor educational and resource interpretation.

This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. These changes
will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this final rulemaking, it is not expected that significant economic impacts
would result. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements
are imposed on small entities by this final rulemaking. Further, the final rule contains no recordkeeping requirements
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces an adjustment of the beginning date of the annual closure of the shrimp fishery in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Texas. The closure is normally from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 15 to July 15 each year. This year the closure will begin on May 13, 1994, because biological data indicate that brown
shrimp will be leaving the Texas estuaries earlier than normal. The Texas closure is intended to prohibit the harvest
of brown shrimp during their major period of emigration from Texas estuaries to the Gulf of Mexico so the shrimp may
reach a larger, more valuable size and to prevent the waste of brown shrimp that would be discarded in fishing operations
because of their small size.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of
Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR part 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The FMP implementing regulations at 50 CFR 658.25 describe the Texas closure and provide for adjustments to the
beginning and ending dates by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, under specified criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Available information meeting the criteria specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 CFR 658.25(b)(1) indicates that a closure date earlier than May 15 is warranted and desirable. Biological data
collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department indicate that beginning the closure on May 13, 1994, is necessary
to provide adequate protection of small brown shrimp emigrating from the Texas estuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the time and date at 50 CFR 658.25(a) for beginning the Texas closure is changed from 30 minutes after
sunset, May 15, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset on May 13, 1994. During the closure, the area described at 50 CFR 658.25(a)
is closed to all trawl fishing, except that a vessel may fish for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
royal red shrimp beyond the 100-fathom (183-m) depth contour. The waters of Texas are also closed commencing 30 minutes
after sunset on May 13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The termination date of the Texas closure will be adjusted in accordance with the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to conform to the termination date of the closure in the waters of Texas. The adjusted termination date will be published
in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary provides final regulations to implement the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership
(NEISP) Program, a new program authorized under the amended HEA, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325). The Secretary also amends
a reference to the NEISP Program in 34 CFR 75.60 of the regulations for the Direct Grant Programs. The Secretary also
is making technical amendments in separate final regulations to insert references to the NEISP Program into the appropriate
sections of 34 CFR part 668, the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NEISP Program provides States with Federal financial incentives to establish or maintain a program with matching
State-originated funds. It provides for (1) a scholarship component that, to the extent possible, guarantees the
financial assistance necessary for eligible low-income students who graduate from high school to attend an institution
of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education, and (2) an early intervention component that uses Statewide resources, both government and private,
to provide additional counseling, financial aid counseling, mentoring, academic support, outreach, and supportive
services to preschool, elementary, middle, and secondary school students who are at risk of dropping out of school.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEISP Program's early intervention component supports National Education Goals 2 (High School Completion),
3 (Student Achievement and Citizenship), and 4 (Science and Mathematics). The NEISP Program's scholarship component
also supports National Education Goal 5 (Adult Literacy and Lifelong Learning). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 10926&hyph;10937). The major issues addressed by the proposed regulations are discussed in the preamble to
the NPRM. Except for minor editorial and technical revisions, there are no differences between the NPRM and these
final regulations. One of the technical revisions is that the Secretary is including in &sect;693.40(d) the requirement
under section 404D(d)(2) of the HEA that, to be eligible for a NEISP Program scholarship, a student must have received
a high school diploma or a certificate of high school equivalence on or after January 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, six parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority_are not addressed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended &sect;693.10(b)(1) be modified to have the State agency that administers the State Student
Incentive Grant (SSIG) Program be the only designated agency for administering the NEISP Program. The commenter
believed that, since the SSIG agency was already involved with the administration of grant and loan programs as well
as early intervention programs, the agency would be able to ensure that the Statewide efforts would be well-coordinated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the circumstances described by the commenter may be true in some States, the States vary with respect to how they
distribute various responsibilities among State agencies. The Secretary, therefore, continues to believe that
requiring the Governor of a State to designate the agency responsible for the NEISP Program provides necessary flexibility
for the States. In addition, it ensures that program funds are allocated to an appropriate and responsible State agency
and is consistent with other Federal and State-administered student financial aid programs, such as the SSIG Program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that a State would have to identify private funds expended within the State under &sect;693.10(b)(5)(i)
and &sect;693.13(a)(4) to ensure that the funds provided under the NEISP Program will supplement and not supplant
funds expended for State and local early intervention programs and State need- and non-need-based student financial
grant assistance programs. The commenter believed that it would be sufficient to document the amount of State funds
expended on need-based student financial aid alone or the amount expended for State-matching funds for the NEISP
Program. One commenter was also concerned that, in the Supplementary Information section of the preamble to the NPRM
(59 FR 10927), the discussion of this requirement can be interpreted to mean that a State's matching expenditures
under the NEISP Program should be an amount that exceeds, as opposed to being an amount that is in addition to, the amount
of funds the State previously expended. Another commenter questioned whether State funds appropriated to postsecondary
institutions and used for student assistance in the State could be used as matching funds under &sect;693.10(b)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary notes that the texts of &sect;693.10(b)(5)(i) and &sect;693.13(a)(4) refer only to ``State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
public, expenditures as does the applicable statutory provision (section 404B(b)(3) of the HEA). Under &sect;693.10(b)(5)(i)
and &sect;693.13(a)(4), a State's matching funds under the NEISP Program represent expenditures that are in addition
to the level of funds previously expended instead of a matching amount that exceeds the previous level of expenditures,
and these funds may include State funds appropriated to postsecondary educational institutions and used for student
grant aid including tuition waivers at public institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters requested clarification concerning whether under &sect;693.11(a) the States were required to provide

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended modifying &sect;693.12(c) (1) and (2) to include an option for a State to award scholarships
based on the State's definition and prioritization of low-income students as an alternative to the expected family
contribution (EFC) as calculated under part F of title IV of the HEA. Another commenter recommended the Secretary
adopt as a standard for defining low-income students the standard used for the Federal TRIO programs.

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter that there are additional standards for identifying low-income students
and agrees that a State should be able to use the State's criteria for identifying low-income students in prioritizing
eligible students as an alternative to using the EFC. However, the Secretary believes that using the EFC represents
a proven methodology for identifying low-income students and that it is in the Federal interest for any departures
from using the EFC to be subject to approval by the Secretary.

 One commenter believed that the extensive data requested under &sect;693.20(e)(2) should be collected for the targeted
area in which the State plans to operate its program rather than providing data covering the entire State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary believes that, in order to be able to target the areas in which the NEISP Program will be most beneficial,
it is necessary for States to collect and analyze Statewide data as required under &sect;693.20(e)(2). The Secretary
notes that this requirement is not intended to be overly prescriptive and that a State is expected to have sufficient
information available to make a reasonable determination of Statewide needs for early intervention activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that the ``tie-breaker'' to be used in the selection of similarly rated applications under
&sect;693.22(c)(4) should not give preference to Statewide programs. Due to the limited Federal funding, the commenter
proposed that priority be given to programs that will serve a targeted population well, rather than serving students
Statewide but in a less effective way.

 The Secretary believes that the emphasis placed on selecting applicants with Statewide, coordinated programs is
appropriate. Since this provision is a ``tie-breaker'' for otherwise similarly rated applications, the Secretary
does not believe that the State providing services to more areas will be less effective.

 One commenter believed that early intervention programs should be provided as early in a student's schooling as necessary
to be effective and, therefore, believed that there should be a stronger preference for long-term early intervention
programs in the selection criteria.

 During the development of the NPRM, the Secretary gave careful consideration to the need to emphasize long-term mentoring

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a State, as part of its early intervention program under &sect;693.11, requires a student to sign an agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that includes academic milestones, the Secretary agrees that the State should be able to require that a student meet
these milestones as one of the student eligibility requirements for a scholarship. However, if a student has participated
in the early intervention program, the student should be eligible for scholarship consideration since income level
is not necessarily the basis for determining scholarship eligibility in the NEISP Program under section 404D(d)
of the HEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

The Secretary is amending &sect;693.40 to provide that if a State includes academic milestones in a written agreement

requirement.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter believed that under proposed &sect;693.40(e) (1) and (2) the Secretary should not limit scholarship
eligibility to those students who participated in the NEISP Program or a Federal Upward Bound Program. The commenter
believed that accepting early intervention programs comparable to those described in section 404C of the program
statute as meeting the requirement would allow States the flexibility to identify additional students as eligible
to receive scholarships.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter and further notes that section 404D(d)(4) of the HEA clearly provides for
such an option since it does not require that the early intervention program establishing student eligibility for
a scholarship be funded under the NEISP Program as is required in the case of the Federal Upward Bound Program in section
404D(e)(2) of the HEA.

One commenter believed that, due to the comprehensive nature of the biennial evaluation report under &sect;693.50(b),
it would not be reasonable to estimate one hour to complete the report. In the commenter's opinion, the report could
not be designed and implemented in less than two staff months.
