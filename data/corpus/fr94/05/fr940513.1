SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Personnel Management is proposing to consolidate existing Federal student employment programs into
one streamlined, flexible program that: adapts to changing market conditions and occupational demands, encourages
greater participation and partnerships between Federal agencies and educational institutions in developing effective
programs, and serves as a critical tool to assist agencies in building a diverse workforce. The program would consist
of two components: work-study and temporary student positions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, a number of different student employment programs and appointing authorities have often impeded
Federal agencies from meeting critical employment challenges with innovative solutions. This new framework will
substitute complex regulatory guidance with a flexible approach to developing student educational and employment
programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under this authority, agencies can develop innovative work-study or temporary programs to attract students. For
instance, agencies could create internship programs with a tuition assistance option for students attending college
(associate, undergraduate, and graduate), and vocational and technical institutions. Students in these agency/academic
tailored programs can be employed in professional, scientific, administrative, technical, clerical, and trades/crafts
occupations.

Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, a new authority, the Student Educational Employment Program, would replace the
following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(p) graduate students in scientific, professional or analytical positions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(q), students in scientific, professional and technical positions,
GS&hyph;9 and below;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(v), temporary summer aid;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(w), stay-in-school program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(y), summer employment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(jj), legal intern positions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(a) through (c), (e) and (g), cooperative education program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3102(d), Harry S. Truman Foundation Scholarship Program; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(f), Federal Junior Fellowship Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the new program, agencies would appoint students under &sect;213.3202(b) (work study) and &sect;213.3202(c)
(temporary). The new schedule B authority would contain both a Work-Study Component, &sect;213.3202(b) and a Temporary
Student Component, &sect;213.3202(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new program, the definition of student is an individual who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in at least
a half-time academic course load in an accredited high school, technical or vocational, associate, baccalaureate,
graduate, or professional diploma or certificate program. An individual is still deemed to be a student as long as
there are no breaks in course work of more than 5 months and the student shows to the satisfaction of the agency and academic
institution that he/she has a bona fide intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training. An individual
who has to complete less than half of an academic course load immediately prior to graduating is still considered a
student.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies may appoint students on a full-time, part-time or intermittent basis at any time during the year. The student's
work schedule should not interfere with his or her academic studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Work-Study Component
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The work-study component provides experience that is directly related to the student's educational program. Agencies
should appoint students under &sect;213.3202(b) when the job is related to their academic field of study. Programs
developed under this component provide for a schedule of periods of attendance at an accredited school combined with
periods of career-related work in a Federal agency. Agencies, participating educational institutions, and students
should agree on a formally-arranged schedule of school and work to ensure that work responsibilities do not interfere
with academic performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Students appointed under this component will be classified as Student Trainees, to the -99 series of the appropriate
occupational group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Students appointed under &sect;213.3202(b) (work study) may be noncompetitively converted to a career or career-conditional
appointment under Executive Order 12015 when students have: (1) completed within the preceding 120 days an educational
program and course requirements at an accredited school; (2) completed at least 640 hours of career-related work,
before completion of or concurrently with, the course requirements (agencies have the option of increasing this
requirement for some or all of its occupation fields); (3) been recommended by the employing agency in which the career-related
work was performed; and (4) met the qualification standards for the targeted position to which the student is appointed.
Conversions will be to an occupation related to the student's academic training and work-study experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Temporary Student Component
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This component provides flexibility to agencies to appoint students on a temporary basis to jobs that may/may not
be related to the students' academic field of study. The intent of a temporary student component is to provide maximum
flexibility and opportunity to agencies and students that will meet both of their needs on a short-term basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Classification for students appointed under this component is based on the occupational series for which they are
hired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(c) would be used for students employed on a not-to-exceed 1 year appointment.
Appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments as long as the employee is enrolled or accepted
for enrollment as a student in a diplomat or certificate program at an accredited academic institution and is performing
at the fully successful or higher performance summary level. Students would not be eligible for conversion to a career
or career-conditional appointment under this authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Movement Between Components
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies may noncompetitively move students between temporary and work-study components if students meet the requirements
for that component. Movement between components will require using the appointing authority for the component that
the student is entering.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Work performed in the temporary component can not be credited toward meeting the work period requirements of the work-study
component.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Student Volunteers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The student volunteer program will continue to be covered by Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, part 308, Volunteer
Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Student Financial Assistance Option
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under both components of this program, agencies have the option of using financial need criteria to hire talented
students who demonstrate a need for income from employment to continue their education. OPM will continue to develop
and distribute annual economic guidelines for use in determining financial need. State Employment Service Offices
and financial aid offices in schools can assist in making these determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefit Entitlements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since it is expected that appointments under the work-study component would be for more than 1 year, students would
be eligible for retirement, health benefits, and life insurance. Students under the temporary component are not
eligible for retirement or life insurance but would become eligible for health benefits coverage only after they
complete 1 year of current, continuous employment. Since under the temporary appointment no Government contribution
would be available, the employee would pay the entire premium.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Tuition Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under both components of this program, agencies may use their training authority in 5 U.S.C. chapter 41 and 5 CFR part
410 to pay for all or part of training expenses. Under the work-study component, an agency may pay other expenses directly
related to training, including travel and transportation expenses between duty stations and schools.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to allow, under certain conditions, the cold treatment of imported fruits upon arrival at the port
of Wilmington, NC. We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers
that are adequate to prevent the introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape
from shipments of fruit before undergoing cold treatment. We are also proposing to delete cold treatments in the regulations
and replace them with a reference to cold treatments in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, which
is incorporated by reference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Fruits and Vegetables regulations, contained in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56&hyph;8 (referred to below as ``the
regulations''), prohibit or restrict the importation of fruits and vegetables to prevent the introduction and dissemination
of injurious insects, including fruit flies, that are new to or not widely distributed in the United States. The Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers these regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations, APHIS allows certain fruits to be imported into the United States if they undergo sustained
refrigeration (cold treatment) sufficient to kill certain insect pests. Cold treatment temperature and refrigeration
period requirements vary according to the type of fruit and the pests involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most imported fruit that requires cold treatment undergoes cold treatment in transit to the United States. However,
APHIS allows imported fruit to undergo cold treatment after arrival in the United States at certain ports designated
by APHIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, cold treatment is limited to ports in the northern United States because APHIS has determined that insect
pests escaping from shipments of imported fruit after arrival in the United States would be unable to survive winter
weather conditions in the north. The following ports are currently authorized by APHIS to conduct cold treatment
on imported fruit: Atlantic ports north of, and including, Baltimore, MD; ports on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence
Seaway; Canadian border ports on the North Dakota border and east of North Dakota; and, for air shipments, Washington
DC, at Baltimore-Washington International and Dulles International airports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently, we received petitions from individuals at the ports of Wilmington, NC, and Gulfport, MS, requesting that
we amend the regulations to allow cold treatment to be conducted at these ports. On November 12, 1993, in response to
these petitions, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 59953, Docket No. 93&hyph;121&hyph;1) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting public comment
on whether we should allow cold treatment at ports in the Southern United States and in California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning this notice for a 45-day period ending on December 27, 1993. During that period,
we received four comments, three from State governments and one from a grower organization. Two comments opposed
allowing cold treatment at ports in the Southern United States and California, arguing that allowing such treatments
would place California and Florida citrus crops at too great a risk of fruit fly infestation. Another comment requested
that we perform a detailed pest-risk analysis before deciding whether to allow cold treatment at southern and California
ports. Another comment supported allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we are still considering whether to allow cold treatment at other ports in the Southern United States and California,
we are now proposing to allow cold treatment of certain fruit, under certain conditions, at the port of Wilmington,
NC. We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers adequate to prevent
introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape from shipments of fruit before
undergoing cold treatment. Also, we are proposing to impose additional special conditions regarding cold treatment
at Wilmington, NC, that would further reduce the risk of fruit fly introduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to meeting the requirements in &sect;319.56&hyph;2d of the regulations regarding cold treatment, the
port of Wilmington, NC, cold treatment facilities would be required to operate under the following additional special
conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Bulk shipments (those shipments which are stowed and unloaded by the case or bin) of fruit arriving for cold treatment
must be packaged in fly-proof packaging that prevents the escape of adult, larval, or pupal fruit flies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Bulk and containerized shipments of fruit arriving at the port of Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment must be cold-treated
within the port, that is, the area over which the Bureau of Customs is assigned the authority to accept entries of merchandise,
to collect duties, and to enforce the various provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Advance reservations for cold treatment space at the port of Wilmington, NC, must be made prior to the departure
of a shipment from its port of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe these requirements would reduce the risk of fruit fly introduction into the United States in the event infested
shipments of fruit entered the port of Wilmington, NC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal to allow cold treatment of fruit under certain conditions at the port of Wilmington, NC, is based, in
part, on a draft document, prepared by APHIS, assessing the pest risks associated with allowing cold treatment of
tropical fruit fly host materials at certain United States ports. Some of the risk mitigation measures discussed
in the draft are included in this proposal as requirements for the port of Wilmington, NC. Copies of this draft document
may be obtained from Mr. Victor Harabin at the address listed under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would revise the PPQ Treatment Manual, which has been incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations
at 7 CFR 300.1, to reflect the addition of Wilmington, NC, to the list of ports where cold treatment of imported fruits
can be conducted, under certain conditions, upon arrival.

We are also proposing to replace the four cold treatment schedules currently listed in &sect;319.56&hyph;2d(a)
with a single reference to the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference
at 7 CFR 300.1. The cold treatments listed in the PPQ treatment manual are applicable for any fruit required to be cold
treated under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also as a nonsubstantive editorial change, we are proposing to remove and reserve the regulations under &sect;319.56&hyph;2q,
regarding conditions governing the entry into the United States of pummelo from Israel, and to add pummelo from Israel
to the list, under &sect;319.56&hyph;2x, of fruits and vegetables requiring treatment as a condition of entry into
the United States. This change would simplify the regulations by placing pummelo from Israel on a list of commodities
with similar entry requirements, but would not revise current requirements concerning the entry into the United
States of pummelo from Israel.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to allow, under certain conditions, cold treatment of imported fruit upon arrival at the port of Wilmington,
NC. As a result of this proposal, a number of different fruits could be imported into Wilmington, NC. Specifically,
officials of the North Carolina State Ports Authority in Wilmington, NC, anticipate that apples, grapes, and pears
from Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa would be imported and cold treated at the port of Wilmington, NC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 20 million pounds of each fruit could be imported annually into Wilmington, NC, as a result of this rule,
though we anticipate the amount would be much smaller. While some of the fruit arriving at Wilmington, NC, would be
imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the United States, some merely would be shipments
diverted from other ports also approved to conduct cold treatment on arrival. In the following analysis of the potential
impact of this action on domestic producers of apples, grapes and pears, in order to demonstrate the greatest possible
economic impact, we have assumed that the maximum amount of fruit would be imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment,
and further, that those commodities would be imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the following analysis, we have used published price flexibilities to estimate the potential economic effects
of allowing apples, grapes, and pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC; flexibilities are used to estimate relationships
between changes in supply and subsequent changes in price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, 36,718 farms in the United States, of which 1,186 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. Although it is
not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less,
according to Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards), it is likely that most would. In 1992, domestic
farms produced almost 5.78 billion pounds of apples for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.13 billion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the volume of apples imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute
about 7.5 percent of current total imports into the United States, about 0.35 percent of current domestic production
and about 0.33 percent of the current total apple supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that a 0.33 percent increase in the supply of apples would lead to a decrease of about 0.20 percent in the domestic
price of apples (using a price flexibility for apples of ^0.590, based on all Eastern States' sales of North Carolina
apples), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.038 per hundredweight
(cwt), or $0.00038 per pound, from an original price of $0.195 per pound. As a result of the price decrease, there could
be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. apple producers of about $2.20 million, which is roughly 0.20 percent of the original
total revenue of $1.13 billion. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing apples to be cold treated at Wilmington,
NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers.

In 1987, 23,236 farms in the United States, of which 286 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992 domestic
farms produced about 1.54 billion pounds of grapes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $327 million. Although
it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million
or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would.

If the volume of grapes to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 2.9 percent of current
total imports to the United States, about 1.3 percent of current domestic production and about 0.89 percent of the
current total grape supply in the United States (domestic and imports).

Assuming that a 0.89 percent increase in the supply of grapes would lead to a decrease of about 0.88 percent in the domestic
price of grapes (using a price flexibility for California grapes of ^0.981), we estimate that this increase in supply
would result in a price decrease of about $3.73 per ton, or $0.0019 per pound, from an original price of $425.62 per ton.
As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. grape producers of about $2.9 million,
which is roughly 0.88 percent of the original total revenue of $327 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing
grapes to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, 10,092 farms in the United States, 88 of which were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992, domestic
farms produced about 890 million pounds of pears for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $168 million. Although
it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million
or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the volume of pears to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 15.4 percent of current
total imports to the United States, about 2.2 percent of current domestic production and about 2.0 percent of the current
total pear supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that a 2.0 percent increase in the supply of pears would lead to a decrease of about 1.2 percent in the domestic
price of grapes (using a price flexibility for California pears of ^0.609), we estimate that this increase in supply
would result in a price decrease of about $4.51 per ton, or $0.0023 per pound, from an original price of $377.61 per ton.
As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. pear producers of about $2.0 million,
which is roughly 1.19 percent of the original total revenue of $168 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing
pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in light of the preceding analyses (which estimate greatest possible, and thus highly unlikely, economic
effects), as well as our expectation that most imports of fruit to Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment would occur during
the off-season for domestic production, we anticipate that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact
on domestic producers of apples, grapes, and pears. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, we anticipate that allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC, could have beneficial economic
effects. Importers who routinely transport fruit to the Southeastern United States could benefit from this action
due to lower transportation costs. Freight companies and shipping companies in North Carolina, as well as the local
economy, might also benefit. Also, consumers are likely to gain from the increased selection of products and any price
decreases, albeit small, that occur with increases in supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would allow cold treatment of certain fruits to be conducted at the port of Wilmington, NC. If this
proposed rule is adopted, State and local laws and regulations regarding the importation of fruits under this rule
would be preempted while the fruits are in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution
and sale to the consuming public, and would remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question
of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If this proposed rule is adopted,
no retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act (Act) of 1985 and the Order issued thereunder,
this proposed rule would increase the amount of the assessment per pound due on imported pork and pork products to reflect
an increase in the 1993 six market average price for domestic barrows and gilts. This proposed action would bring the
equivalent market value of the live animals from which such imported pork and pork products were derived in line with
the market values of domestic porcine animals. This proposed rule also would revise the Harmonized Tariff System
(HTS) numbers which identify imported live porcine animals, pork, and pork products to conform with recent changes
in these numbers made by the United States Customs Service (USCS). These proposed changes will facilitate the continued
collection of assessments on imported porcine animals, pork, and pork products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposal is not intended to have a retroactive effect. The Act states that
the statute is intended to occupy the field of promotion and consumer education involving pork and pork products and
of obtaining funds thereof from pork producers and that the regulation of such activity (other than a regulation or
requirement relating to a matter of public health or the provision of State or local funds for such activity) that is
in addition to or different from the Act may not be imposed by a State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1625
of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, a provision of
such order or an obligation imposed in connection with such order is not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification
of the order or an exemption from the order. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States
in the district in which person resides or does business has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's determination,
if a complaint is filed not later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 20 days after the date such person receives notice of such determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action also was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Order upon small entities was discussed in the September 5, 1986, issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 31898), and it was determined that the Order would not have a significant effect upon a substantial number of
small entities. Many importers may be classified as small entities. This proposed rule would increase the amount
of assessments on imported pork and pork products subject to assessment by two-hundredths of a cent per pound, or as
expressed in cents per kilogram, four-hundredths of a cent per kilogram. Adjusting the assessments on imported pork
and pork products would result in an estimated increase in assessments of $143,000 over a 12-month period. Accordingly,
the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This proposed rule would also revise HTS numbers for imported porcine animals, pork, and
pork products subject to assessment from 11 digits to 10 digits to conform a change in those HTS numbers made by USCS.
The change made in the number of digits in HTS numbers is merely a technical change and will not impose any new requirements
on importers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act (7 U.S.C. 4801&hyph;4819) approved December 23, 1985, authorized the establishment of a national pork promotion,
research, and consumer information program. The program was funded by an initial assessment rate of 0.25 percent
of the market value of all porcine animals marketed in the United States and an equivalent amount of assessment on imported
porcine animals, pork, and pork products. However, that rate was increased to 0.35 percent effective December 1,
1991 (56 FR 51635). The final Order establishing a pork promotion, research, and consumer information program was
published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 5, 1986, issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 31898; as corrected, at 51 FR 36383 and amended at 53 FR 1909, 53 FR 30243, 56 FR 4, and 56 FR 51635) and assessments
began on November 1, 1986.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Order requires importers of porcine animals to pay USCS, upon importation, the assessment of 0.35 percent of the
animal's declared value and importers of pork and pork products to pay USCS, upon importation, the assessment of 0.35
percent of the market value of the live porcine animals from which such pork and pork products were produced. This proposed
rule would increase the assessments on all of the imported pork and pork products subject to assessment listed in 7
CFR 1230.110 (September 8, 1993; 58 FR 47205). This increase is consistent with the increase in the annual average
price of domestic barrows and gilts for calendar year 1993 as reported by USDA, AMS, Livestock and Grain Market News
(LGMN) Branch. This increase in assessments would make the equivalent market value of the live porcine animal from
which the imported pork and pork products were derived reflect the recent increase in the market value of domestic
porcine animals, thereby promoting comparability between importer and domestic assessments. This proposed rule
would not change the current assessment rate of 0.35 percent of the market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology for determining the per-pound amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for imported pork and pork products was described in the Supplementary Information accompanying the Order and published

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the September 5, 1986, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 51 FR 31901. The weight of imported pork and pork products is converted to a carcass weight equivalent by utilizing
conversion factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are published in the USDA Statistical Bulletin No. 616 ``Conversion Factors and Weights and Measures.'' These
conversion factors take into account the removal of bone, weight lost in cooking or other processing, and the nonpork
components of pork products. Secondly, the carcass weight equivalent is converted to a live animal equivalent weight
by dividing the carcass weight equivalent by 70 percent, which is the average dressing percentage of porcine animals
in the United States. Thirdly, the equivalent value of the live porcine animal is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by multiplying the live animal equivalent weight by an annual average market price for barrows and gilts as reported
by USDA, AMS, LGMN Branch. The annual average price, which was based on price data from seven major markets, is now based
on only six markets. One of the seven markets_Kansas City_closed in 1991; and thus the 1992 and 1993 annual average
prices are based on price data from only six markets. This average price is published on a yearly basis during the month
of January in LGMN Branch's publication ``Livestock, Meat, and Wool Weekly Summary and Statistics.'' Finally, the
equivalent value is multiplied by the applicable assessment rate of 0.35 percent due on imported pork and pork products.
The end result is expressed in an amount per pound for each type of pork or pork product. To determine the amount per kilogram
for pork and pork products subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assessment under the Act and Order, the cent-per-pound assessments are multiplied by a metric conversion factor
2.2046 and carried to the sixth decimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula in the preamble for the Order at 51 FR 31901 contemplated that it would be necessary to recalculate the equivalent
live animal value of imported pork and pork products to reflect changes in the annual average price of domestic barrows
and gilts to maintain equity of assessments between domestic porcine animals and imported pork and pork products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average annual market price increased from $42.11 in 1992 to $45.32 in 1993, an increase of about 7 percent. This
increase would result in a corresponding increase in assessments for all HTS numbers listed in the table in &sect;1230.110
of an amount equal to two-hundredths of a cent per pound, or as expressed in cents per kilogram, four-hundredths of
a cent per kilogram. Based on the most recent available Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, data on the total
dollar value of imported pork and pork products subject to the assessment in 1993 the proposed increase in assessment
amounts would result in an estimated $143,000 increase in assessments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USCS recently revised HTS numbers to conform with changes in importation procedures. The change is only a minor technical
change which revises all HTS numbers for live porcine animals, pork, and pork products listed in the table found at
&sect;1230.110 (58 FR 47205) by changing them from 11 digit numbers to 10 digit numbers by dropping the last digit.
The live porcine animals, pork, and pork products subject to assessment and HTS article descriptions listed in a chart
contained in the Supplementary Information section on page 15914 of the final rule (54 FR 15914) would not change.
A comparison of the 11 digit numbers and the proposed 10 digit numbers are listed in the following chart.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document includes not only the Department of Agriculture (USDA) procedures to implement 15 U.S.C. 3710(i) but
also draws upon the General Services Administration (GSA) regulations concerning the disposal of excess personal
property. However, because of the limited ability at the Office of Operations (00) to change the portions of this Part
that reflect GSA policy, comments on those portions are not appropriate for this proposed rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will has been reviewed under Executive Order No. 12866, and it has been determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 mllion or more or adversely and
materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This rule will not create any serious inconsistencies or otherwise
interfere with any actions taken or planned by another agency. It will not materially alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs and does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. In addition, it will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is given in compliance with Executive Order No. 12778. All State and local laws and regulations that
are in conflict with his rule are preempted. No retroactive effect is to be given to this rule. This rule does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

This proposed rule would amend agency regulations by requiring Immigration Judge to enter an order of deportation
or exclusion, without a hearing, if satisfied that the alien voluntarily entered into a plea-negotiated or otherwise
stipulated request for an order of deportation or exclusion. It further codifies the practice of Immigration Judges
conducting telephone hearings in deportation, exclusion, or rescission cases, and codifies the authority of the
Immigration Judge to hold video teleconferenced hearings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
supplementary information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule amends 8 CFR 3.25 by requiring the Immigration Judge, under new subparagraph (b), to enter an order
of deportation or exclusion on the written record, without an in-person hearing, based upon the stipulated written
request of the respondent/applicant and the government, provided that the Immigration Judge determines that the
charging document sets forth a valid basis for deportability or excludability; the stipulated request for an order
of deportation or exclusion is voluntarily entered into by the respondent/applicant; and the respondent/applicant
specifically waives relief from deportation or exclusion as well as the described hearing rights. The requirements
that the Immigration Judge enter the order without a hearing is limited to cases in which the applicant or respondent
was represented at the time of the stipulation. The stipulation must be signed on behalf of the government and by both
the applicant or respondent and his or her attorney or other representative qualified under part 292 of this chapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This procedure codifies the litigation practice in some jurisdictions where, if a party enters into a stipulated
request for a deportation or exclusion order with a written waiver of his or her appearance and rights, the Immigration
Judge may sign the order of deportation or exclusion based upon the written record. This practice facilitates judicial
efficiency in uncontested cases. For example, it has been used to expedite departure shortly after the sentencing
of aliens convicted of offenses rendering them immediately deportable or excludable. Whereas this practice currently
occurs at the discretion of the Immigration Judge, the proposed rule would make it mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedure also has been used by imprisoned criminal aliens having no apparent avenue of relief from deportation
or exclusion who, after consultation with counsel, wish to avoid further detention pending deportation or exclusion
proceedings following release from prison. While protecting the rights of the parties, the rule also implements
the statutory requirement of expeditious deportation of criminal aliens under 8 U.S.C. 1252(i), 1252a(d). If used
more widely by litigants and criminal prosecutors, the procedure could alleviate overcrowded federal, state, and
local detention facilities and eliminate the need to calendar such uncontested cases on crowded immigration court
dockets. The procedure is not limited to cases arising from the criminal context and can be used in other appropriate
settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New subparagraph (c) establishes the authority of Immigration Judges to hold telephonic hearings. Although the
proposal is meant to be applicable nationwide,

INS,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 884 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1988), holds that telephonic deportation hearings may only be conducted with the consent of
the parties. This is in conflict with the proposed regulation, which permits telephonic hearings to be conducted
at the discretion of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judges in the geographical confines the Ninth Circuit
currently follow 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purba
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will continue to follow the law of the circuit if the proposed rule is finally adopted. In all areas outside the Ninth
Circuit the regulation would be effective and telephonic hearings would be conducted when an Immigration Judge,
in his or her sound discretion, deems it appropriate. Subparagraph (c) also codifies the authority of Immigration
Judges to hold video teleconferenced hearings. This practice increases administrative efficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposed rule also makes minor technical changes in subparagraph (a) to conform with the

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section
1(b) of Executive Order No. 12291 and this rule has no Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612. The rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections

This proposed rule establishes an alternative procedure for filing proof of fee payment for appeals of Immigration
Judge decisions to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board). It provides added flexibility in the appeal filing procedure
by permitting a respondent/applicant to certify that a fee was forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(Service). It further allows thirty (30) days from the date of filing the appeal for the respondent/applicant to submit
a fee receipt. It also provides that failure to present proof of payment of fee will cause the appeal to be deemed improperly
filed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule provides a flexible alternative to the existing procedure of filing appeals of Immigration Judge
decisions before the Board of Immigration Appeals. The current procedure mandates that a timely filed notice of appeal
include a copy of a fee receipt or a fee waiver application. The proposed alternative procedure would allow the filing
of an appeal of the Immigration Judge's decision to the Board with a certification stating that the fee has been forwarded
to the Service. A sample certification follows the proposed rule. The respondent/applicant would then have thirty
(30) days from the date of filing the notice of appeal to obtain and file a copy of the fee receipt. This alternate procedure
may be particularly useful when the respondent/applicant is located a great distance from a Service office or is in
a custodial setting. This alternate procedure provides additional flexibility for such a person by creating a thirty
(30) day window of time, in which he or she may submit proof of payment of the appropriate fee for an appeal. It also preserves
the current appeal filing deadline and fee filing procedures.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend existing regulations by providing, in specified circumstances, for the automatic
termination of temporary resident status under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) upon the
entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion. This amendment is necessary to avoid possible delays in, or termination
of, pending deportation and exclusion proceedings that would result if the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS or Service) were required to follow the existing procedures for the termination of temporary resident status.
This amendment would permit the expeditious deportation and removal of aliens who hold temporary resident status,
but who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, or who have been found to be ineligible for admission into the United
States for reasons that are not waivable. This rule would also prevent the release of dangerous criminal liens into
society during deportation or exclusion proceedings.

This proposed regulation is necessary in order to correct a procedural anomaly that has resulted in the release of
aggravated felons who hold temporary resident status and has impaired the ability of the INS to deport those who, after
obtaining temporary resident status, commit deportable acts.

3138 (BIA September 10, 1990), that the status of a lawful temporary resident alien who commits a deportable offense
must be terminated pursuant to &sect;245A(b) (2) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(b)(2)), and in accordance with 8 CFR 245a.2(u),
before commencement of deportation proceedings. By following this precedent, INS is unable to detain deportable
aliens, such as those who commit aggravated felonies, who hold temporary resident status, without first stripping
the alien of his or her temporary resident status.

interpretation of 8 CFR 244a.2(u)(2) confronts the INS with conflicting obligations. On the one hand, &sect;242(a)(2)(A)
of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(A)) requires the INS to detain any alien convicted of an aggravated felony and &sect;242
of the Act generally establishes the procedure for apprehension and deportation of aliens. On the other hand, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
stands as an obstacle to detaining and deporting such individuals until the alien's temporary residency status is
revoked.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 8 CFR 245a.2(u)(2) also grant more procedural rights to temporary residents_who must first have their status
revoked_than to lawful permanent residents, who may simply be deported upon the commission of an aggravated felony,
without first terminating their status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment harmonizes with other provisions of 8 CFR 245a.2(u)(1), which it will amend. This section
currently provides, in part:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 245(a)(1) of the Act may be terminated
at any time in accordance with section 245A(b)(2) of the Act. It is not necessary that a final order of deportation be
entered in order to terminate temporary resident status.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the existing regulation contemplates that institution of deportation proceedings may precede termination
of resident status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation will correspond to regulations currently in force with respect to Special Agricultural
Workers. Special Agricultural Workers' temporary resident status is automatically revoked upon the entry of a final
order of deportation or exclusion. 8 CFR 210.4(d) (promulgated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1160(a)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in other contexts, courts have recognized that deportation entails loss of lawful resident status. See,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., Marti-Xiques 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in order to avoid any delay or termination of deportation or exclusion proceedings that may be caused by invoking
the termination procedure prescribed in &sect;245a.2(u)(2)(i), and to permit the expeditious deportation and
removal of aggravated felons as required by sections 242A(d) and 242(i) of the Act, the INS proposes to add a new paragraph
(ii) to &sect;245a.2(u)(2), to provide for the institution of deportation or exclusion proceedings and the automatic
termination of lawful resident status upon the entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion in cases where: (1)
the ground for deportation arises under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)) (convicted
aggravated felons); or (2) the ground of deportability arises after the acquisition of temporary resident status,
and that ground may not be waived pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(d)(2)(B)(ii))
(relating to certain crimes, drug offenses, national security, and likelihood of becoming a public charge); or (3)
the alien seeks admission, and the ground of inadmissibility may not be waived pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii)
of the Act.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant
adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It will affect certain individual aliens, not
small entities. This is not a significant rule within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does
this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with
Executive Order 12612.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' regulations to provide that
United States origin health certificates include all test results, certifications, or other statements required
by the foreign country of destination. This action appears necessary to ensure that the origin health certificate
contains all of the information required by the foreign country of destination. We are also proposing to amend the
requirements concerning scrapie for sheep and goats intended for export. This action would clarify the regulations
and make the terminology used in the export regulations consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations.
We are also proposing to revise one definition in the domestic scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those
regulations consistent with each other.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the
regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations provide, among
other things, that all animals intended for exportation to a foreign country, except animals intended for exportation
to Mexico or Canada and cattle from Mexico imported into the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return
to Mexico, must be accompanied from the State of origin of the export movement to the port of embarkation by an origin
health certificate. All animals intended for exportation to Mexico or Canada, except cattle from Mexico imported
into the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return to Mexico, must be accompanied from the State of origin
of the export movement to the border of the United States by an origin health certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations state that the origin health certificate shall certify that the animals were inspected within the
30 days prior to the date of the movement of the animals for export, and were found to be sound, healthy, and free from
evidence of communicable disease and exposure to communicable disease. The origin health certificate, issued by
an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) representative or an accredited veterinarian, must be endorsed
by an authorized APHIS veterinarian in the State of origin. The origin health certificate must also include any test
results added by the authorized APHIS veterinarian pursuant to 9 CFR 161.3, which allows test results to be added to
an origin health certificate after it is issued or signed by an accredited veterinarian. (Because of a typographical
error, the reference in part 91 is to ``&sect;161.2.'' As part of this proposed rule, this reference would be corrected.)
The origin health certificate must individually identify the animals in the shipment as to species, breed, sex, and
age, and, if applicable, must also show registration name and number, tattoo markings, or other natural or acquired
markings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the information described in the preceding paragraph, a foreign country of destination may require
that its health requirements be added to the origin health certificate. Because these requirements are not imposed
by the United States, and may vary from export to export depending on the requirements of the destination country,
they are not set out in our regulations. However, unless all information required by a foreign government is included
on the origin health certificate, that animal may be refused entry into the foreign country upon export. To help prevent
the return of animals to the United States because they were refused entry in another country, we are proposing to amend
&sect;91.3 to require that the origin health certificate include any test results, certifications, or other statements
required by the foreign country of destination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exportation of Sheep and Goats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 91 also set forth the conditions under which sheep and goats are eligible for exportation
with regard to scrapie. Scrapie is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system of sheep and goats.
The signs that become manifest may include nervousness, incoordination, slight muscular tremors, visible weight
loss, lack of luster in the animal's wool, and itching. Infected animals become debilitated and die. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in &sect;&sect;91.6(a)(3) and 91.8(a) provide that a goat or sheep shall not be exported if it is affected
with or exposed to scrapie; if it originated from, or has been on, any premises which then were infected or source flock
premises; if it is the progeny, sire or dam, or full or half brother or sister of any animal found to be affected with scrapie;
or if it was moved from premises located in an area quarantined for scrapie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations, infected premises are those on which an animal has been found to be infected with scrapie,
and source flock premises are those premises from which an affected animal was moved within 18 months or less prior
to showing signs of scrapie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the 18-month time period was established for source flocks, existing biological evidence indicated that the
incubation period for scrapie was less than 18 months. Therefore, flocks from which an affected animal was moved more
than 18 months prior to showing signs of scrapie were not considered to be at risk from the scrapie-affected animal.
However, evidence now available indicates that scrapie develops more slowly than previously thought, with an incubation
period that could last for years, and that averages more than 18 months. Therefore, a flock from which a sheep or goat
was moved more than 18 months prior to showing signs of scrapie could be at risk from the affected animal. We are therefore
proposing to amend &sect;&sect;91.6 and 91.8 by removing footnote 4, which refers to source flock premises as those
premises from which an affected animal was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs of scrapie, and to define
``source flock'' as defined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to amend &sect;&sect;91.6 and 91.8 to prohibit the exportation of scrapie positive animals and all
animals from infected flocks, source flocks, and trace flocks, as defined in both 9 CFR part 54 (which describes the
Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program in place in the United States) and 9 CFR part 79 (which imposes interstate
movement restrictions for sheep and goats). We are also proposing to prohibit the exportation of exposed animals,
as defined in part 79, and to amend the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
scrapie-exposed animals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in part 54 to update it and make it consistent with the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed animal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in part 79. The definitions of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed animal, infected flock, scrapie-positive animal, source flock, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exposed animal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any animal which has been in the same flock at the same time within the previous 60 months as a scrapie-positive animal,
excluding limited contacts. Limited contacts are contacts between animals that occur off the premises of the flock,
and do not occur during or immediately after parturition for any of the animals involved. Limited contacts do not include
commingling (when animals concurrently share the same pen or same section in a transportation unit where there is
uninhibited physical contact).

in accordance with (9 CFR part 79), through histological examination of central nervous system samples from the animal
for microscopic lesions in the form of neuronal vacuoles or spongy degeneration, or by the use of protease-resistant
protein analysis or other confirmation techniques used in conjunction with histological examination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A flock in which a Veterinary Services representative has determined that at least two animals, that were diagnosed
as scrapie-positive animals at an age of 54 months or less, were born. In order to be a source flock, the second scrapie-positive
diagnosis must be made within 60 months of the first scrapie-positive diagnosis. A flock will no longer be considered
a source flock after it has completed the requirements of a flock plan.

Trace flock. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A flock in which a Veterinary Services representative has determined that one animal, which was diagnosed as a scrapie-positive
animal at an age of 54 months or less, was born. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We consider each of the flocks and animals described in these definitions to pose a risk of transmitting scrapie. The
proposed changes to the regulations would both ensure that such animals are not exported, and make the terminology
used in part 91 consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are making several other changes to the export provisions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;91.6(a) and 91.8(a). As noted above, those paragraphs prohibit the export of a sheep or goat if it was
moved from premises located in an area quarantined for scrapie, or if it is the progeny, sire or dam, or full or half brother
or sister of any animal found to be affected with scrapie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prohibition of the export of sheep and goats from premises in a quarantined area is outdated. The provisions that
formerly were set forth in part 79 for quarantining areas in which scrapie exists have been replaced in part 54 with
a program focusing on individual flocks. Therefore, we are proposing to remove the prohibition, in &sect;&sect;91.6(a)
and 91.8(a), of the export of sheep and goats from premises in an area quarantined for scrapie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to make nonsubstantive changes to the wording in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;91.6(a) and 91.8(a). We would replace the words ``sire or dam'' with the word ``parent,'' and would replace
the words ``full or half brother or sister'' with the word ``sibling.''

Scrapie-Exposed Animals 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in 9 CFR part 54 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
scrapie-exposed animals 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in part 54 differs from the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed animals 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in part 79. The definition in part 54 reads as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scrapie-exposed animals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Animals, other than affected or bloodline animals, in a flock in which an affected animal has been diagnosed by a Veterinary
Services representative or state representative. Animals in the flock are no longer considered exposed after they
are destroyed or upon the flock's release from surveillance by state animal health officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is outdated and does not reflect current practice. For instance, we no longer conduct a bloodline
program, nor is surveillance conducted under the current voluntary flock certification program. The definition
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed animal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in part 79 (set forth above) was published as part of the current program, and does reflect current practice. Therefore,
we are proposing to amend &sect;54.1 to remove the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
scrapie-exposed animals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and to add the same definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exposed animal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that appears in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.1.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, we have performed an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact
of this proposed rule on small entities. This proposed rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. However, we do not currently have all the data necessary for a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning potential impacts. In
particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may incur benefits or costs
from implementation of this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 21 U.S.C. 105, 113, 120, 121, 612, 613, and 614, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations
to require inspection and certification of animals intended for export from the United States, and to take other measures
to prevent the exportation of diseased livestock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed rule, we would require that the origin health certificate required for animals exported from
the United States include any test results, certifications, or other statements required by the foreign country
of destination. Under this proposed rule, we would also revise the export regulations in &sect;&sect;91.6(a)(3)
and 91.8(a) to make them consistent with the regulations in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79 regarding the Voluntary Scrapie Flock
Certification Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We anticipate the proposed changes involving certification will have little or no impact on small domestic exporters.
In order for exporters to sell their animals abroad, the animals must meet the import requirements of the country of
destination. Therefore, it is in the exporter's interest, even under the current regulations, to ensure that those
requirements are met. The proposed change would require only that the origin health certificate include all test
results, certifications, or other statements required by the country of destination. However, estimates of the
number of animals and the number of small entities that would be affected, and the potential costs to exporters, are
not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes concerning sheep and goats with regard to scrapie would affect some producers. Under the current
regulations in part 91, sheep and goats from source flock premises may not be exported, and source flock premises are
considered those from which an animal affected with scrapie was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs
of scrapie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, the export of sheep and goats from source flocks would continue to be prohibited,
but the meaning of ``source flock'' would be revised to mean a flock in which at least two animals were diagnosed as scrapie-positive
animals at an age of 54 months or less, provided the second diagnosis was made within 60 months of the first, and provided
the requirements of a flock plan have not been completed. This change would make the regulations more restrictive,
and could increase the number of animals prohibited exportation because they originated in a source flock. However,
as of September 1993, there were only 8 source flocks in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed change would apply to both sheep and goats, at present the number of goats being exported is minimal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 92,500 sheep farms in the United States, with approximately 11 million sheep. The large majority
of these are small entities. Ninety-nine percent of the sheep farms in this country each have annual sales totalling
less than $500,000, and approximately 77,000 have fewer than 100 sheep. In 1992, there were approximately 830,000
sheep exported from the United States.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1212 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. 13317, requires the Department of Energy to make, subject to
the availability of appropriations, incentive payments to the owners or operators of qualified renewable energy
facilities for the production and sale of electric energy from certain renewable energy sources. With certain exceptions,
qualified renewable energy facilities are renewable energy conversion facilities (solar, wind, geothermal, or
biomass) owned by States, subdivisions of States, or nonprofit electrical cooperatives that generate electric
energy for sale. The goal of the incentive program is to advance the use of renewable energy conversion systems in the
United States, particularly those systems that use emerging technologies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The payment rate begins at 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, adjusted for fiscal year 1994 inflation over fiscal year 1993,
for energy produced in fiscal year 1994. For energy produced in subsequent years, payment rates will be similarly
adjusted annually to account for inflation. Payments may be made for 10 years only to owners or operators of qualified
facilities first put in service during the period beginning on October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stated purposes of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, of which section 1212 is a part, are promotion of: ``
(1) Increases in the production and utilization of energy from renewable energy resources; (2) further advances
of renewable energy technologies; and (3) exports of United States renewable energy technologies.'' 42 U.S.C. 13311.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1212 appears to be complementary to sections 1914 and 1916 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Section 1914 amended
the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour adjusted for inflation for electricity
produced from wind or from biomass derived from organic matter grown exclusively for use in generating electricity.
26 U.S.C. 45. Section 1916 amended the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent the energy investment tax credit for
non-utility investors in solar and geothermal property. 26 U.S.C. 48(a)(2). Sections 1914 and 1916 are designed
to assist in making certain emerging renewable energy technologies cost competitive. Section 1212 appears to have
a similar objective with regard to State instrumentalities and nonprofit electric cooperatives neither of which
can benefit from tax credits because they do not pay Federal income taxes.

II. Description of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.1 defines the purpose and scope of part 451 as setting policies and procedures governing the administration
of the renewable energy production incentive program and the process for the payment of incentives. This proposed
section states that determinations with regard to incentive payments are not subject to the Department's general
financial assistance regulation in 10 CFR part 600. Those regulations deal with grants and cooperative agreements
that are awarded to stimulate assistance recipients to undertake certain future activities with Federal funds.
In contrast, the incentive payments under section 1212 are a reward for activities that have already taken place and
there is no stated restriction with regard to what the recipient does with the Federal funds received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.2 sets forth the definitions for part 451. The first defined term is ``closed-loop biomass''
which is based on the definition of the same term in section 1914. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, closed-loop
biomass energy facilities, in contrast to other eligible biomass energy facilities, would receive priority payment
in the event that Congress has not appropriated enough funds to make all incentive payments in any given fiscal year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;451.2 defines the term ``fiscal year'' as the standard Federal fiscal year which runs from October
1 of any given year to September 30 of the next year. Section 1212 refers to fiscal years, but does not provide a definition.
In the absence of any legislative history to the contrary, Congress is assumed to have intended use of the standard
Federal fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;451.2 defines the term ``nonprofit electrical cooperative,'' which is one category of eligible
owners named in section 1212. The proposed definition is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code dealing
with tax exempt organizations and on information provided by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
The Department invites comments on the adequacy of this definition and related suggestions for editing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 1212 does not use the term ``renewable energy source,'' or any other term, to characterize the eligible
energy sources, the Department has found it useful at various points in the proposed rule. The definition is based
on the list of energy sources in paragraph (b) of section 1212 which refers to ``solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal
energy.'' 42 U.S.C. 13317(b). It is also based on the list of excepted (and therefore ineligible) energy sources in
subparagraphs (b)(1) (municipal solid waste) and (b)(2) (certain dry steam geothermal energy). 42 U.S.C. 13317(b)
(1), (2). Wind and biomass are indirect forms of solar energy. The specification of those two indirect forms as well
as the word ``solar'' suggests that Congress meant the word ``solar'' to include only direct forms of solar energy,
namely, solar heat (concentrated solar insulation for a solar thermal electric facility) and solar light (concentrated
or unconcentrated solar insulation for a solar photovoltaic electric facility). That reading is supported by the
facts with regard to indirect forms of solar energy. Indirect forms of solar energy other than wind and biomass (e.g.,
hydropower) are either fully competitive with fossil fuels without need of an incentive payment or are at a development
stage such that an incentive payment could not make them cost competitive with fossil fuels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.2 defines the term ``renewable energy facility'' which appears in section 1212. The key part
of the definition is the reference to ``a system or an integrated set of components'' which makes it clear that the facility
is mostly equipment such as heat exchangers or turbines and that the facility does not include the land on which it is
located. In addition, for geothermal facilities it does not include the geothermal field, and for biomass facilities
it does not include the biomass farm. The proposed definition also omits any reference to equipment for transmission
or use of electricity because the text of paragraph (b) of section 1212 which defines the term ``qualified renewable
energy facility,'' does not state that such a facility must include such equipment. It is important to note that the
definition refers to electric energy ``in whole or in part'' from a renewable energy source. That language takes account
of the likelihood that some facilities will produce electric energy in part from a non-renewable energy source such
as fossil fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, proposed 451.2 defines the term ``State'' which is not defined in the text of section 1212. However, given
the above-quoted stated purpose of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress
meant for incentive payments to be available for power generation in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States. This qualification is explicitedly set forth
in proposed &sect;451.4(g) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.3 deals with who is eligible to apply. Consistent with section 1212, it states that any owner or
operator of a qualified renewable energy facility may apply. However, it qualifies the word ``operator'' to make
clear that such a person or entity must have the written consent of the owner. A contractual provision would suffice,
but it is not the only written manifestation of owner consent that would be acceptable. This provision will enable
the Department to avoid a situation where both the owner and operator of a facility apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.4 answers the question: What is a qualified renewable energy facility? Proposed paragraph (a)
tracks section 1212 by providing that various State instrumentalities or a nonprofit electric cooperative must
be the owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies an ambiguity in section 1212 with regard to what constitutes ownership. In light
of the possibility that the facilities of nonprofit electric cooperative may be financed, the Department worded
proposed paragraph (b) to cover situations in which the cooperative has all rights to the beneficial use of the qualified
renewable energy facility, but legal title is held by a financing source for the benefit of the cooperative. The Department
invites comments on the adequacy of proposed paragraph (b) in light of experience with the title aspects of financing
arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) tracks the language of section 1212 by requiring that the electricity generated must be ``for
sale in, or affecting, interstate commerce among the States.'' The Department is inclined to interpret the word ``sale''
to mean a transaction between two entities, who may be related, involving the transfer of electric energy for consideration.
Thus, electric energy generated by an entity for internal use by that entity would not constitute a ``sale.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) restates that only ``renewable energy sources'' as defined by proposed &sect;451.2 are covered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e) lists the types of biomass and geothermal energy sources specifically excluded by section
1212. This paragraph reflects the provisions of section 1212(b)(1) and (2). 42 U.S.C. 13317(b)(1) and (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) tracks the provision of section 1212 which requires that the facility must first be used during
the period beginning with October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department considered inclusion of a requirement that, to be considered qualified for receipt of
incentive payments, a facility must be purchased and installed without financial assistance from other federal
programs. The requirement was omitted from this proposed rule because of uncertainty regarding the total breadth
and form of federal programs that might be applicable to facility design, construction, installation, and operation.
The Department will consider this possibility further and invites comments on the advisability of such a requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.5 deals with where and when to apply. Proposed paragraph (a) permits the filing of an application
only in response to an annual notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Issuance of that notice should closely follow enactment of appropriations. Proposed paragraph (b) concerns the
initial application. It provides that such an application may be filed in the first fiscal year following that in which
electricity eligible for incentive payments is first generated, and that subsequent applications may be filed in
the fiscal years following those in which electricity eligible for incentive payments is generated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the requirements of section 1212, proposed &sect;451.6 provides that the Department may only make
incentive payments for a 10-fiscal year period to any particular qualified renewable facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.7 describes metering requirements which the Department thinks are desirable to promote the
accuracy and veracity of applications for incentive payments. In all cases, the number of kilowatt-hours generated
and sold is to be metered. If non-qualifying renewable or non-renewable energy sources as well as qualifying renewable
energy sources are used, proposed &sect;451.7 would not require electrical metering of sources where such is not
possible or practical. In such cases, the kilowatt hours attributable to the qualified renewable energy source must
usually be calculated from fractions of heat input, or other energy input, from the several sources. Such inputs must
be metered, measured, or otherwise quantified from the respective raw energy streams using commonly accepted (and
identified) procedures and conversion methodologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.8 sets forth application content requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the requirements are self-explanatory. However, several of them deserve some discussion to focus them for
public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) would require: ``That components and equipment, representing at least 50 percent of the capital
cost of the qualified renewable energy facility, were substantially manufactured in a State.'' This provision is
consistent with the purposes of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is modeled on a provision of section 6 of
the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989, as amended by title XII of the
Energy Policy Act of 1992. 42 U.S.C. &sect;12005(b)(1)(B). Like section 6, it would not exclude entities merely on
the basis of foreign ownership. It would promote domestic jobs and production without discriminating against foreign
entities that invest in production facilities in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (g) and (h) would require independently audited and certified statements of the monthly and
annual electric energy generated and sold. The content of the certification should be similar to the type of certification
supplied by an accounting firm in a company's annual report to shareholders. Paragraph (h) also describes the calculation
necessary when the metered number of kilowatt-hours represents electric energy generated from renewable and non-renewable
or excluded-renewable energy sources. The proposed requirement for an independently audited and certified statement
will minimize the chance of erroneous claims and the need for DOE audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with applicable regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 5 CFR 1320.6(f), proposed paragraph
(k) would require a statement agreeing to retain records for a period of three years to provide for prompt access to,
or copies of, such records in response to a written request by DOE. DOE is still considering whether the retention period
should be the entire ten year period during which incentive payments may be collected. DOE did not propose a longer
retention period because the proposed audit and certification requirements would make fraud or mistake unlikely.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Section 451.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;451.9 describes DOE's procedures for processing applications for incentive payments including
the statutory formula for initially calculating the amount due and the adjustment for inflation. DOE is proposing
a procedure to deal with the possibility that there could be a shortage of appropriations to make the full incentive
payments. The President's annual budget request and Congressional action on that request will precede receipt of
the applications in every year. It is therefore unlikely that Congress will appropriate precisely the amount necessary
to make the full incentive payments. In the event that the amount appropriated is less than the amount required to make
full payments to all qualified applicants, the proposed procedure involves priority first (and, if necessary, pro
rata payments) to all owners or operators of solar, wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass facilities, and priority
second (and, if necessary, pro rata payments) to owners or operators of all other qualified facilities. This procedure
favors emerging technologies which are similarly favored by the tax credit provisions of sections 1914 and 1916.
These technologies are close to or in early commercialization stages where the incentive payments can help speed
the commercialization process. If payments are reduced as a result of a shortage of appropriations, the kilowatt-hours
attributable to the shortfall will accrue for payment in succeeding years to the extent that Congress appropriates
funds sufficient to allow payment for these accruals together with other eligible electricity production.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE is proposing an administrative remedy for those aggrieved by the initial decision of the DOE Deciding Official
who will be the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In order to exhaust administrative
remedies, it will be necessary to appeal to DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals. This procedure has two virtues. It
would be less expensive than pursuing a judicial remedy immediately. It would also ensure that DOE has made a record
which is appropriate for judicial review in the event a petition for review is filed in a federal court.

III. Regulatory Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has concluded that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria which define
such actions under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, and is therefore exempt from regulatory review. Accordingly,
no clearance of this proposed rule by the Office of Management and Budget is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, which requires
preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions. DOE has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small entities because
the rule directly affects only qualified renewable energy facilities owned by state or local governments or non-profit
electrical cooperatives, and such facilities are not deemed small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., and recordkeeping
requirements are proposed by this rulemaking. Accordingly, this notice has been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review and approval of paperwork requirements. Earlier in this notice, DOE described the application
content proposed for use under the rule. The information DOE proposes to collect on the applications for incentive
payments is necessary to determine whether the applicant is qualified for payment. The frequency of the information
collection is monthly for those entities eligible to apply for incentive payments. It is estimated that less than
40 entities will apply for incentive payments in the first year, growing to less than 200 over a ten year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden is estimated to average 25 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and retrieving the collection
of information. The collection of information contained in this proposed rule is considered the least burdensome
for the Department of Energy's functions to comply with the legal requirements and achieve program objectives. However,
comments are requested concerning the accuracy of the estimated paperwork reporting burden, in addition to the proposed
record retention requirement discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Review Under Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National
Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government.
If there are sufficient substantial effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment
to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing policy action. This proposed rule establishes
an incentive program under which state owned renewable energy facilities may qualify for incentive payments based
on the amount of electric energy the facility generates using specified renewable sources for sale in, or affecting
interstate commerce. The Department has determined that since the generation of electricity is not a primary function
of a State, the proposed rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional
functions of States.

VII. Review Under Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations.
These requirements, set forth in section 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity,
drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected legal
conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable
effort to ensure that the regulation describes any administrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review
and any provisions for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies that the proposed rule meets the
requirements of section 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has determined that promulgation of this proposed rule falls within the procedural rulemaking class, Category
A6 of Appendix A to Subpart D, ``Categorical Exclusions Applicable to General Agency Actions'', of the DOE National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. 10 CFR part 1021. It is therefore categorically excluded from preparation
of either an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement under the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321, et. seq).

Calculating payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to adjustments under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, incentive payments under this part to the owner
or operator of any qualified renewable energy facility shall be calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours
of electricity generated through the use of renewable energy sources and sold to another entity during the payment
period by 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjustments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of the incentive payment to any owner or operator under this section shall be adjusted for inflation for
each fiscal year beginning after calendar year 1993 in the same manner as provided in section 29(d)(2)(B) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, except that in applying such provisions the calendar year 1993 shall be substituted for calendar
year 1979. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If there are insufficient appropriations available to make incentive payments for all approved applications,
DOE shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On a priority (and if necessary on a pro rata) basis, make incentive payments first with respect to qualified renewable
energy facilities using wind, solar, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass technologies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the event there are insufficient funds for full incentive payments to applicants other than those specified
in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, reduce the amount of incentive payments to these other applicants on a prorated
basis by the ratio of appropriated funds remaining after payments under paragraph (g)(1) to the total approved incentive
payments for the other applicants; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Treat the number of kilowatt-hours attributable to the portion of any incentive payment which is reduced under
this paragraph as accrued energy that may be combined with energy subsequently produced from the same source for which
subsequent application for incentive payment is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) After calculating the amount of the incentive payment under paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, the DOE
Deciding Official shall then issue a notice of the determination to the applicant_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Approving the application as appropriate for payment and forwarding a copy to the DOE Finance Office with a request
to pay; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Setting forth the calculation of the approved amount; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Stating the amount of accrued kilowatt-hours, if any, and the energy source for same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the application does not meet the requirements of this part or some of the kilowatt-hours claimed in the application
meriting an incentive payment are disallowed as unqualified, the Deciding Official shall issue a notice denying
the application in whole or in part with an explanation of the basis for denial.

set forth in subpart H of 10 CFR part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, which amended the Farm Credit Act of 1971, the Corporation was created,
among other things, to manage the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) which was established to ensure the
timely payment of principal and interest on insured notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations issued on behalf
of the Farm Credit System (FCS) Banks. The Corporation must be appointed as the conservator or receiver for any FCS
institution placed into conservatorship or receivership by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) after January
5, 1993. The Corporation has the authority to examine, as it deems necessary, FCS banks, direct lender associations,
and FCS institutions in receivership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations set forth procedures to be used in requesting access to and responding to requests for
Corporation Privacy Act records. As required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), the Corporation is notifying the public of the proposed
regulations. They provide that all requests for access to Corporation Privacy Act records must be in writing and signed
by the subject of the record, adequately describe the material sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia.
The proposed regulations delegate to the Privacy Act Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning
requests for access to records. The proposed regulations provide procedures for requests for amendment of records
and the appeal of an initial adverse determination on a request to amend a record. The proposed regulations also recite
the statutory bases for exemption from disclosure. Finally, the proposed regulations provide a fee structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are sought on all the provisions contained in the regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway
30 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Thomaston-Upson County Airport has recently been developed.
Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed for instrument flight
rules (IFR) operations when utilizing this SIAP. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace for IFR operators executing the developed SIAP. If approved, the operating status of the airport would
change from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for
IFR operators executing the NDB Runway 30 SIAP to serve the Thomaston-Upson County Airport. The coordinates for this
airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective
September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the
Order. If approved, the operating status of the airport would be changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations
concurrent with publication of the SIAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed regulations defining the phrase ``influencing legislation'' for purposes of the
deduction disallowance for certain amounts paid or incurred in connection with influencing legislation. These
regulations are necessary because of changes made to the Internal Revenue Code by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993. These rules will assist businesses and certain tax-exempt organizations in complying with the Internal
Revenue Code. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains proposed Income Tax Regulations under section 162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(Code), as amended by section 13222 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) (107 Stat. 477). These
proposed regulations relate to the definition of ``influencing legislation''. On December 27, 1993, a notice of
proposed rulemaking (IA&hyph;57&hyph;93) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (52 FR 68330) concerning the rules for allocating costs to certain activities, including influencing legislation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13222 of OBRA 1993 amended section 162(e) of the Code, concerning the deductibility of certain lobbying and
political expenditures. As amended, section 162(e)(1)(A) denies a deduction for amounts paid or incurred in connection
with influencing legislation. However, certain lobbying expenditures relating to local legislation are not subject
to section 162(e)(1)(A). In addition, section 162(e)(1)(D) denies a deduction for any amount paid or incurred in
connection with influencing certain federal executive branch officials. Section 162(e)(1)(B) and (C) continues
the rules disallowing business deductions for amounts paid or incurred in connection with grassroots lobbying and
participation in political campaigns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 162(e)(4)(A) defines ``influencing legislation'' as ``any attempt to influence any legislation through
communication with any member or employee of a legislative body, or with any government official or employee who may
participate in the formulation of legislation.'' Section 162(e)(5)(C) provides that ``[a]ny amount paid or incurred
for research for, or preparation, planning, or coordination of, any activity described in paragraph (1) [including
`influencing legislation'] shall be treated as paid or incurred in connection with such activity.'' The legislative
history of the amendment to section 162(e) indicates that attempts to influence legislation should be distinguished
from ``mere monitoring'' of legislative activities. The legislative history further provides, however, that if
a taxpayer monitors legislation and subsequently attempts to influence that or similar legislation, the monitoring
activity should generally be treated as ``in connection with'' the attempt to influence legislation (and, therefore,
the costs relating to that monitoring activity would be non-deductible).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4911, relating to the excise tax on certain lobbying activities of certain electing public charities, contains
a definition of ``influencing legislation'' that is essentially identical (as it relates to direct, as opposed to
grassroots, lobbying) to the definition of that term in section 162(e)(4)(A). Because of this similarity, these
proposed regulations adopt rules that are similar to the rules applicable to direct lobbying communications under
&sect;56.4911&hyph;2(b)(1). However, section 162(e) differs from section 4911 in certain material respects.
For example, section 4911(d)(2) contains exceptions to the term ``influencing legislation,'' while section 162(e)(4)
does not. Moreover, these proposed regulations under section 162(e) and the regulations under section 4911 differ
in some respects due to the nature of charitable organizations described in section 501(c)(3) as compared to, for
example, organizations described in section 501(c)(6) and for-profit entities. Accordingly, taxpayers should
not infer that these proposed regulations reflect an interpretation of section 4911 or the regulations thereunder.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Selected Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations define ``influencing legislation'' in the same terms as the statutory definition in section
162(e)(4)(A), which requires a ``communication'' with a government official or employee. With respect to that communication,
the proposed regulations adopt rules similar to the rules in the section 4911 regulations. Those rules require that
the communication refer to specific legislation and reflect a view on that legislation. This approach was believed
to be more appropriate than a general facts and circumstances analysis because it provides reasonably objective
criteria for determining whether an attempt to influence legislation has been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also provide rules for determining which activities support a lobbying communication
and, therefore, are considered part of the attempt to influence legislation. The principal issue in this regard is
whether the mere fact that an activity is used in some manner to support a lobbying communication should be sufficient
to treat that activity as part of the attempt to influence legislation. This approach has been referred to by some commentators
as a ``lookback'' rule, in that lobbying activities would be identified solely by ``looking back'' from the lobbying
communication to those activities which supported it. While a lookback approach would appear to be consistent with
the legislative history, numerous comments suggested that the administrative burdens associated with a lookback
rule could be onerous, particularly if the period of the lookback were long or unlimited. Accordingly, these comments
recommended that a lookback rule not be adopted, or, if adopted, that it be limited to a brief period of time. Some of
the comments suggested that an appropriate period of time may be six months, by analogy to the limited lookback rule
applicable to certain grassroots lobbying activities under the section 4911 regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of the statute, its legislative history, and the comments received, it was concluded that a lookback
rule would not be appropriate. Instead, the proposed regulations provide that only those activities engaged in for
the purpose of making or supporting a lobbying communication will be treated as a lobbying activity. This approach
strikes an appropriate balance between taxpayers' need for greater contemporaneous certainty regarding whether
a particular activity may be treated as a lobbying activity, and Congress' objective of not allowing a deduction for
lobbying activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury and the IRS view the legislative history on this point as voicing a concern that taxpayers may attempt to abuse
an intent- or purpose-based rule by labelling their lobbying activities as ``mere monitoring.'' To protect against
that potential abuse, while also providing greater certainty regarding those activities that are less likely to
be lobbying activities, the proposed regulations provide presumptions regarding the purpose for engaging in certain
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the temporal connection between the lobbying communication and the related activity is an important factor
in assessing whether the related activity was engaged in for the purpose of supporting the lobbying communication,
the presumptions turn to a considerable extent on whether the activity occurred during the taxable year in which the
lobbying communication was made or the immediately preceding year. It was believed that the mere closing of the annual
accounting period was insufficient, in some cases, to affect this temporal connection, and, consequently, that
the presumption would need to operate in more than one annual accounting period. Thus it was believed that the presumption
period was an appropriate period during which to treat this temporal connection as indicating (rebuttably) the purpose
for engaging in the activity without creating significant difficulties for taxpayers in determining, at the time
they file their returns, whether the presumption is likely to operate with respect to that activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also address those supporting activities that are engaged in for both lobbying and non-lobbying
purposes. In this connection, some of the comments have suggested that a principal or primary purpose test be adopted.
Under this approach, an activity would be treated as influencing legislation if the principal or primary purpose
for engaging in that activity was to make or support a lobbying communication, even if the activity was engaged in for
other, non-lobbying purposes as well. Conversely, an activity would be treated as not involving lobbying if the principal
or primary purpose for engaging in that activity was a non-lobbying purpose, even though a substantial purpose of
the activity was to support lobbying.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration, these suggestions have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. Instead, the proposed regulations require an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is engaged in for both lobbying and non-lobbying purposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated as engaged in partially for a lobbying purpose and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation under &sect;1.162&hyph;28. This allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach was adopted rather than a principal or primary purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test because a principal/primary purpose test does not avoid the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessity of determining the various purposes for engaging in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity and weighing the relative importance of those purposes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and because it has a substantial ``cliff'' effect that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation approach does not. In those situations where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer has substantial lobbying and non-lobbying purposes, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results under a principal/primary purpose test would differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dramatically depending on one's views as to which of the purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is dominant. As a result, Treasury and the IRS have serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns whether that test could be administered responsibly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairly. Finally, nothing in section 162(e) or its legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history indicates that Congress intended to treat activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in for a substantial lobbying purpose as outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of 162(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration was also given to treating an activity as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation if any substantial purpose for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity is lobbying. Treasury and the IRS believe it generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be easier to establish a substantial purpose for engaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an activity, rather than examining all of the purposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a principal/primary purpose. As a result, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach would be easier to administer than a principal/primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose test. Moreover, a substantial purpose test would appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be more consistent with Congressional intent to treat as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation those activities that in fact support a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication than would a principal/primary purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. However, Treasury and the IRS are concerned that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach could be considerably over-inclusive, in that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities engaged in predominantly for non-lobbying purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be treated entirely as non-deductible lobbying activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS invites comments, however, whether this approach would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more appropriate than the rule in the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, to provide taxpayers greater certainty and relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from burdensome recordkeeping regarding certain relatively minor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurring activities, the proposed regulations treat certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities as engaged in solely for non-lobbying purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, as under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
162(e)(4)(A), ``influencing legislation'' means any attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence any legislation through a lobbying communication with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any member or employee of a legislative body or any government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official or employee (other than a member or employee of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative body) who may participate in the formulation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation that the taxpayer desires to influence. A lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication is a communication that either (i) refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) clarifies, amplifies, modifies, or provides support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
views reflected in a prior lobbying communication. Specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation includes both legislation that has already been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced in a legislative body and a specific legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal that the taxpayer either supports or opposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An attempt to ``influence legislation'' means the lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication and all activities, such as research, preparation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other background activities, engaged in for a purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making or supporting the lobbying communication. Whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity is engaged in for this purpose is determined based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the facts and circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a taxpayer engages in an activity both for a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose and for some non-lobbying purpose, the taxpayer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treat the activity as engaged in partially for a lobbying purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation under &sect;1.162&hyph;28. A taxpayer's allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to influencing legislation of only the incremental amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs that would not have been incurred but for the lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose generally is not reasonable. Similarly, an allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the number of purposes for engaging in an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without regard to their relative importance also generally is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations presume that if an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to a lobbying communication was engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year in which the lobbying communication is made, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity was engaged in for all periods solely for that non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying purpose. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part (it cannot be rebutted entirely because the presumption only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operates if the taxpayer establishes that the activity has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose) by establishing that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity was also engaged in for the purpose of making or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting a lobbying communication. Thus, for example, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer regularly conducts an activity in the ordinary course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its business operations beginning at least two taxable years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the taxable year in which the lobbying communication is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made, it would be presumed that the continuing activity was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in to support the lobbying communication, even during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year in which the lobbying communication is made (and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding taxable year). In this regard, it is expected that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a course of conduct spanning a period of time is a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity will be determined based on all the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. In particular, it is expected that a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the way an activity is conducted will result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised activity being considered a separate activity from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier conduct of the activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also presume that if an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to a lobbying communication was engaged in during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same taxable year as the communication is made or in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately preceding taxable year, and is not within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumption described in the preceding paragraph, that activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was engaged in for the sole purpose of making or supporting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication. The taxpayer may rebut this presumption (in whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or part) by establishing that the activity was engaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(entirely or partially) for a non-lobbying purpose. If, during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same taxable year, the taxpayer commences an activity that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relates directly to the subject matter of specific legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(then in existence) and makes a lobbying communication with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to that legislation, it is expected that the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally will be unable to rebut the presumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations treat certain activities as engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in without a purpose of making or supporting a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication. These activities consist of performing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity for purposes of complying with the requirements of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law, reading any general circulation publications, or viewing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listening to other mass media communications available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public. In addition, if, prior to evidencing a purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to influence specific legislation (or similar legislation), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer determines the existence or procedural status of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation; determines the time, place, and subject of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing to be held by a legislative body with respect to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation; or prepares routine, brief summaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of that legislation, the taxpayer is treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaging in that activity without a purpose of making or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting a lobbying communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide a special rule for so- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called ``paid volunteers.'' If, for the purpose of making or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting a lobbying communication, one taxpayer uses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services or facilities of a second taxpayer and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensate the second taxpayer for the full cost of the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or facilities, the purpose and actions of the first taxpayer are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imputed to the second taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association uses the services of a member's employee, at no cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the association, to conduct research or similar activities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the trade association's lobbying communication, the trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's purpose and actions are imputed to the member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the member is treated as influencing legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the employee's work in support of the trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's lobbying communication. The proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also provide a general anti-avoidance rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations are proposed to be effective for amounts paid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred on or after May 13, 1994. Taxpayers will be required to adopt a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation of section 162(e)(1)(A) for amounts paid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred prior to this date.

Modification of 1993 Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 27, 1993, the IRS issued a notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (IA&hyph;57&hyph;93) concerning the allocation of costs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying activities. Section 1.162&hyph;28(g)(3) of those proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations provides a general rule for determining whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting with certain specified government officials or employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes a lobbying activity (a term that includes influencing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation). Because the proposed regulations contained in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document provide rules for determining whether a taxpayer is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in influencing legislation, the IRS will amend &sect;1.162- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28(g)(3), when it is promulgated as a final regulation, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform that provision to these proposed regulations. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, whether sponsoring or attending a meeting constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation will be determined under the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are the subject of these proposed regulations. Thus, for example, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer attends a speech by a legislator at which specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation is discussed, the taxpayer will not necessarily be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be influencing legislation unless the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes a communication with the legislator which refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the taxpayer makes a lobbying communication with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to that legislation (or similar legislation) within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same or the succeeding taxable year, the presumptions provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposed regulations will apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Grass Roots Lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations do not address grass roots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying. Although the proposed regulations provide a definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of influencing legislation that is similar to the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct lobbying communication under the section 4911 regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it should not be inferred that the IRS will adopt the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of grassroots lobbying communication under the section 4911 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for purposes of section 162(e)(1)(C). As noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the prior law rules disallowing business deductions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses for grassroots lobbying and participation in political 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campaigns remain in effect under OBRA 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code, a copy of this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small business.

Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for Monday, September 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, at 10 a.m. in the Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. Because of access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must submit written comments by July 12, 1994, and submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devoted to each topic (a signed original and eight (8) copies) by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monday, August 22, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
162(e)(1)(A). Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule and necessary definitions for determining whether a taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is influencing legislation. Paragraph (c) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides rules for determining whether a purpose of an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to make or support a lobbying communication which constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation. Paragraph (d) of this section provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a special rule relating to the use by one taxpayer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services or facilities of another taxpayer in connection with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general anti-avoidance rule. Paragraph (f) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the effective date. See section 162(e)(2) and &sect;1.162&hyph;20(c) for exceptions relating to certain
local legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules are not intended to be applied for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4911 and the regulations thereunder. See section 4911 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;&sect;56.4911&hyph;1 through 56.4911&hyph;10 for rules relating to excise

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Examples
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illustrated by the following examples:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Taxpayer P's employee, A, is assigned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach members of Congress to gain their support for a pending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bill. A drafts and P prints a position letter on the bill. P 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributes the letter to members of Congress. Additionally, A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personally contacts several members of Congress or their staffs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to seek support for P's position on the bill. The letter and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal contacts are lobbying communications. Therefore, P is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Taxpayer R is invited to provide testimony at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
congressional oversight hearing concerning the implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1989. Specifically, the hearing concerns a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation increasing the threshold value of commercial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential real estate transactions for which an appraisal by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state licensed or certified appraiser is required. In its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony, R states that it is in favor of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Because R does not refer to any specific legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reflect a view on any such legislation, R has not made a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication. Therefore, R is not influencing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. State X enacts a statute that requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing of all day-care providers. Agency B in State X is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged with writing rules to implement the statute. After the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enactment of the statute, Taxpayer S sends a letter to Agency B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing detailed proposed rules that S recommends Agency B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt to implement the statute on licensing of day-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers. Because the letter to Agency B neither refers to nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects a view on any specific legislation, it is not a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication. Therefore, S is not influencing legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Taxpayer T proposes to a State Park Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it purchase a particular tract of land for a new park. Even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if T's proposal would necessarily require the State Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Authority eventually to seek appropriations to acquire the land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and develop the new park, T has not made a lobbying communication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because there has been no reference to, nor any view reflected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on, any specific legislation. Therefore, T's proposal is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) Taxpayer U prepares a paper that asserts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lack of new capital is hurting State X's economy. The paper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that State X residents either should invest more in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local businesses or increase their savings so that funds will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to others interested in making investments. U forwards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a summary of the unpublished paper to legislators in State X with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cover letter that states in part:

availability of new capital in the state.

(ii) Because neither the summary nor the cover letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to any specific legislative proposal, forwarding the

(iii) Q, a member of the legislature of State X, calls

letter that simply refers to the enclosed materials. Because U's

letter to Q and the unpublished paper do not refer to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation or reflect a view on any such legislation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the letter is not a lobbying communication. Therefore, U is not

. (i) Taxpayer V prepares a paper that asserts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lack of new capital is hurting the national economy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paper indicates that lowering the capital gains rate would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the availability of capital and increase tax receipts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the capital gains tax. V forwards the paper to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives in Congress with a cover letter that says, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(ii) V's communication is a lobbying communication because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it refers to and reflects a view on a specific legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal that V supports (i.e., lowering the capital gains rate). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, V is influencing legislation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a legislator of State A that State X has passed a bill that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishes a stated purpose and then says that State A should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass such a bill. No such bill has been introduced into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State A legislature. The communication is a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication because it refers to and reflects a view on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislative proposal that W supports. Therefore, W is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

. (i) Taxpayer Y represents citrus fruit growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Y writes a letter to a Senator discussing how pesticide O has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefited citrus fruit growers and disputing problems linked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its use. The letter discusses a bill pending in Congress and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states in part:

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This bill would prohibit the use of pesticide O. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If citrus growers are unable to use this pesticide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their crop yields will be severely reduced, leading to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher prices for consumers and lower profits, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy, for growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The communication is a lobbying communication because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Y is influencing legislation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends that legislation be introduced that would create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum capital and surplus requirements for surplus-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies and create clearer guidelines concerning the risks that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surplus-line companies can insure. B's discussion with Q is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication because B refers to and reflects a view on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific legislative proposal that Z supports. Therefore, Z is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influencing legislation.

companies is substantial enough to warrant such legislation and

requests that B provide information on the amount and types of

has employees of Z prepare estimates of the percentage of

property and casualty insurance risks handled by surplus-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies. B sends the estimates with a cover letter that simply

refers to the enclosed materials. Although B's follow-up letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Q does not refer to specific legislation or reflect a view on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such legislation, B's letter supports the views reflected in the

earlier communication. Therefore, the letter is a lobbying

communication and Z is influencing legislation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose or purposes for which a taxpayer engages in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity are determined based on all the facts and circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a taxpayer engages in an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both for the purpose of making or supporting a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication and for some non-lobbying purpose, the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must treat the activity as engaged in partially for a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose and partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to influencing legislation. See &sect;1.162&hyph;28 (allocation rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies). A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's treatment will, in general, not result in a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation if it allocates to influencing legislation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Only the incremental amount of costs that would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been incurred but for the lobbying purpose; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An amount based on the number of purposes for engaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that activity without regard to the relative importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Presumption of non-lobbying purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to a lobbying communication is engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year in which the communication is made, the activity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumed to be engaged in for all periods solely for that non-lobbying purpose. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part by establishing that the activity was also engaged in for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying purpose. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an activity engaged in for multiple purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Presumption of lobbying purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to a lobbying communication is engaged in during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same taxable year as the communication is made or the immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding taxable year, and is not within the presumption in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the activity is presumed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in for the sole purpose of making or supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication. A taxpayer can rebut the presumption (in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole or part) by establishing that the activity was engaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(entirely or partially) for a non-lobbying purpose. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(2) of this section relating to an activity engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in for multiple purposes. If, during the same taxable year, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer commences an activity that relates directly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject matter of specific legislation (then in existence) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes a lobbying communication with respect to that legislation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is expected that the taxpayer generally will be unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebut the presumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Activities treated as having no purpose to influence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A taxpayer that engages in any of the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities is treated as having done so without a purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making or supporting a lobbying communication_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to evidencing a purpose to influence any specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation referred to in this paragraph (c)(5)(i) (A) or (B) (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar legislation)_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Determining the existence or procedural status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation, or the time, place, and subject of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing to be held by a legislative body with respect to specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Preparing routine, brief summaries of the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Performing an activity for purposes of complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of any law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Reading any general circulation publications or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viewing or listening to other mass media communications available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Examples. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this paragraph (c) are

illustrated by the following examples:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1995, Agency F issues proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the business of Taxpayer W, a calendar year taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no specific legislation during 1995 that is similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulatory proposal. W undertakes a study of the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations on its business. W incorporates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of that study in comments sent to Agency F in 1995. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996, legislation is introduced in Congress that is similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulatory proposal. W writes a letter to Senator P stating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it opposes the proposed legislation. With the letter, W 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encloses a copy of the comments it sent to Agency F. W's letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Senator P refers to and reflects a view on specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation and therefore is a lobbying communication. Because W 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used the results of its study of the impact of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations in its letter to Senator P in the taxable year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the taxable year the study was conducted, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumed under paragraph (c)(4) of this section that W engaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the study for the sole purpose of making or supporting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication. Based on these facts, however, W can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebut the presumption entirely by showing that its sole purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for undertaking the study was to comment on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the ordinary course of its business, Taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Y, a calendar year manufacturing company, regularly keeps records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of electricity consumption in its manufacturing process. Y has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept such records since 1970, the year in which Y began business, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to track the cost of its manufacturing process. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, the governor of State Q proposes a budget that includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales tax on electricity. Using its records of electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption, Y estimates the additional costs that the budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would impose upon its business. In the same year, Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writes to members of the state legislature and explains that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposes the increased sales tax. In its letter, Y includes its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate of the costs that the sales tax would impose on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. The letter is a lobbying communication (because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governor's proposed budget). Both the recordkeeping activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the activity of estimating additional costs under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed sales tax relate to the lobbying communication because Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used the records to make the estimates, and Y used the estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its opposition to the governor's proposal. However, Y had a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-lobbying purpose for keeping the records and engaged in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity prior to the first taxable year preceding the taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which it made the lobbying communication. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is presumed that Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept these records solely for a non-lobbying purpose during all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods. Based on these facts, the Commissioner cannot rebut the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumption. In contrast, it is presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, that Y estimated the additional costs it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incur under the proposal solely to make or support the lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication, because the activity commenced in the same taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year as the lobbying communication was made. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts, because Y estimated its additional costs under the budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to support the lobbying communication, Y cannot rebut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presumption as it relates to this activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1995, a Senator in the State Q legislature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announces her intention to introduce legislation to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health insurers to cover a particular medical procedure in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies sold in the state. Taxpayer Y, a calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer, has different policies for two groups of employees, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which covers the procedure and one of which does not. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bill is introduced, Y's legislative affairs staff asks Y's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human resources staff to track claims for the procedure that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed, in order to estimate the additional cost of requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coverage under both policies. In 1996, Y's legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affairs staff prepares a study estimating Y's increased costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the results of tracking, in 1995, the claims made. Also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1996, Y writes to members of the state legislature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explains that it opposes the proposed change in insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage based on the study. The letter is a lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication (because it refers to and reflects a view on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific legislation). Both the activity of tracking the claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the activity of estimating Y's additional costs under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed legislation relate to the lobbying communication because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are used to support that communication. It is presumed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, that Y engaged in 1996 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the activity of estimating the additional costs it would incur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the proposal solely to make or support the lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication, because the activity commenced in the same taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year as the lobbying communication. Based on these facts, Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot rebut the presumption as it relates to this activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because Y did not regularly track these claims before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, it is presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Y engaged in 1995 in the activity of tracking these claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely to make or support the lobbying communication. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facts, because Y tracked these claims to support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication, Y cannot rebut the presumption.

Example 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After several years of developmental work under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various contracts, in 1997, Taxpayer A, a calendar year aerospace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company, contracts with the Department of Defense (DOD) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a prototype of a new generation military aircraft. A is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware that DOD will be able to fund the contract only if Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriates an amount for that purpose in the upcoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriations process. In 1998, A conducts simulation tests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aircraft and revises the specifications of the aircraft's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected performance capabilities, as required under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract. A submits the results of the tests and the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications to DOD. In 1999, Congress considers legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to appropriate funds for the contract. In that connection, A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes the results of the simulation tests and of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft's expected performance capabilities, and submits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary to interested members of Congress with a cover letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that encourages them to support appropriations of funds for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract. The letter is a lobbying communication (because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to specific legislation (i.e., appropriations) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests passage). The described activities in 1998 and 1999 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relate to that lobbying communication and, therefore, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to be for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sole purpose of making or supporting that communication. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these facts, A cannot rebut the presumption as it relates to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the summary prepared specifically for that communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because A conducted the tests and revised the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications to comply with its production contract with DOD, A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can rebut the presumption as it relates to those activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Example 5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
C, president of Taxpayer W, travels to the state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital to attend a two-day conference on new manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. C plans to spend a third day in the capital meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with state legislators to explain why W opposes a pending bill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrelated to the subject of the conference. C's staff prepares a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
briefing book on the pending bill for C's use in meetings with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state legislators. Because the meetings with the legislators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be lobbying communications (because C will refer to and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect a view on specific legislation), C's travel and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the briefing book are presumed to be solely for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purpose of making or supporting the lobbying communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these facts, W cannot rebut the presumption as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relates to the preparation of the briefing book, but can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partially rebut the presumption as it relates to C's travel by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating that the travel was engaged in both for lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and non-lobbying purposes. As a result, under paragraph (c)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, W must reasonably allocate C's travel between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending the conference and meeting with the state legislators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1995, Taxpayer F comments on proposed EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and successfully contests their validity on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutional grounds in litigation. In 1997, Senator N 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduces environmental legislation, which F believes to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unconstitutional on the same grounds as the previously proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and defeated regulations. F sends some of the documents it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared in 1995 to Senator N's staff with a cover letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that F opposes the environmental legislation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter to Senator N refers to and reflects a view on specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation and thus is a lobbying communication. F engaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the activity of preparing the documents, however, for a non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year in which the lobbying communication was made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is presumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the document preparation was engaged in solely for a non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying purpose. Based on these facts, the Commissioner cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebut that presumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 1, 1995, a bill is introduced in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress that would affect Company E, a calendar year taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees in E's legislative affairs department, as is customary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare a brief summary of the bill and periodically confirm the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural status of the bill through conversations with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees and members of Congress. On March 31, 1995, the head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of E's legislative affairs department meets with E's President to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request that B, a chemist, temporarily help the legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affairs department analyze the bill. The President agrees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggests that B also be assigned to draft a position letter in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposition to the bill. Employees of the legislative affairs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
department continue to confirm periodically the procedural status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the bill. On October 31, 1995, B's position letter in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposition to the bill is delivered to members of Congress. B's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter is a lobbying communication because it refers to and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects a view on specific legislation. Under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(5)(i) of this section, the assignment of B to assist the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative affairs department in analyzing the bill and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drafting a position letter in opposition to the bill evidences a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose to influence legislation. Based on these facts, neither 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the activity of periodically confirming the procedural status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bill nor the activity of preparing the routine, brief summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the bill before March 31 constitutes influencing legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to periodically confirming the procedural status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bill on or after March 31, it is presumed, under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(4) of this section, that E engaged in the activity solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make or support the lobbying communication because the activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenced in the same taxable year as the lobbying communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These facts indicate that after March 31, E determined the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural status of the bill for the purpose of supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobbying communication by B and, accordingly, E cannot rebut the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumption as it relates to this activity.

Taxpayer Z prepares a report that it is required

by state law to submit to a state corporation commission. Z 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sends a copy of the report to its delegate in the state

legislature along with the taxpayer's letter opposing a bill that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would increase the state sales tax. Even though the letter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delegate is a lobbying communication (because it refers to, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reflects a view on, specific legislation), under paragraph

to keep abreast of legislative developments. Even if Y attempts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to influence legislation that is identified and tracked in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newsletter, under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, the time

Special imputation rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If one taxpayer, for the

purpose of making or supporting a lobbying communication, uses

the services or facilities of a second taxpayer and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensate the second taxpayer for the full cost of the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or facilities, the purpose and actions of the first taxpayer are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imputed to the second taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association uses the services of a member's employee, at no cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the association, to conduct research or similar activities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the trade association's lobbying communication, the trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's purpose and actions are imputed to the member. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result, the member is treated as influencing legislation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the employee's work in support of the trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's lobbying communication.

The period for commenting on the proposed guidelines on harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin,
age, or disability (58 FR 51266, October 1, 1993) has been extended to June 13, 1994. After the comment period closed,
the Commission received numerous comments and requests by individuals to submit comments. Since the Commission
has informally been accepting and reviewing comments and letters received after the comment period officially closed,
it has thus decided to formally extend the comment period in order to give all parties an opportunity to express their
views.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing the receipt of a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter,
the ``Colorado program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
consists of revisions to the Colorado rules pertaining to bonding of surface coal mining and reclamation operations
and revegetation success criteria for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations,
clarify ambiguities, and improve operational efficiency.

I. Background on the Colorado Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Colorado program can be found in the December 15, 1980, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Colorado's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 906.15,
906.16, and 906.30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated April 18, 1994, Colorado submitted the proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;611). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in response to the May 7, 1986, and March 22, 1990,
letters (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;282 and CO&hyph;496) that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30
CFR 732.17(c), and at its own initiative. The provisions of 2 Code of Colorado Regulations 407&hyph;2, the rules and
regulations of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board, that Colorado proposes to amend are: Rule 1.04, definitions;
Rule 3.02, performance bond requirements for surface coal mining and reclamation operations; Rule 3.03, release
of performance bonds; Rule 3.06, special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities;
and Rule 4.15.10, revegetation success criteria for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential
use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Colorado proposes the following changes to the previsions of its rules at:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 4 p.m., m.d.t. May, 31, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Public Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

IV. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Park Service (NPS) proposes to eliminate registration and check out requirements for climbing and off
trail travel above 7,000 ft., and for winter travel in Grand Teton National Park. Existing regulations requiring
climbers, off trail hikers, and winter travel users to register and check out upon completion of their activity were
intended primarily to provide information necessary to initiate search and rescue responses. Actual experience
over the years has shown that the intended purpose of these regulations has not been achieved. Nearly all search and
rescue responses are generated by reports from sources other than the check out system. Instead of aiding rescuers,
these regulations burden park rangers with the task of checking on countless cases of climbers and backpackers who
failed to check out. These regulations have been enforced selectively for several years, where local climbers and
guides have not been forced to register because of an assumed expertise and knowledge of the local area. The deletion
of these regulations will not eliminate visitor protection services provided by park personnel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing National Park Service (NPS) special regulations that pertain to mountain climbing, off trail travel,
and winter travel trips are codified at 36 CFR 7.22 (f) and (g). They require all technical climbers, off trail travel,
and winter travel users to register or check in prior to undertaking these activities and to check out with a ranger
upon completion of the activity. The original intent was primarily to provide park search and rescue personnel with
the knowledge that a park user was in essence overdue from a potentially dangerous activity. In reality, almost all
perceived overdue parties concerned climbers and backcountry users failing to properly check out. In addition,
the vast majority of winter travelers either ignore or do not know of the requirement to register, and strict enforcement
of this regulation has not been done for several years. The result has been a combination of non-compliance, failure
to check out, failure to contact a ranger in a timely manner and wasted time and energy on the part of the park staff administering
the system. After working with these restrictions since promulgation it has been determined that they are not achieving
their original purpose of saving lives by alerting search and rescue personnel. In reality, almost all park search
and rescue efforts are the result of initial reports by climbing partners, other park backcountry users, friends
or relatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPS believes the deletion of these rules will make the management of mountain climbing and winter backcountry
trips more consistent with the practices of both state and federal agencies whose lands are contiguous with Grand
Teton National Park. Overnight backcountry trips will continue to be regulated by general camping regulations at
36 CFR 2.10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A voluntary registration system will be available to climbers and backcountry travelers who choose to use it. The
exchange of information between climbers, off trail hikers, winter travelers and park rangers will still be available
and encouraged without mandating it through regulation. Furthermore the park staff will be educating park users
to leave trip information with family or friends, shifting responsibility for trip planning onto the park user.

The NPS has determined that this proposed rulemaking will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human
environment, health and safety because it is not expected to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Increase public use to the extent of compromising the nature and character of the area causing physical damage
to it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the nature and characteristics of the area, or cause physical
damage to it;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this determination, this proposed rulemaking is categorically excluded from the procedural requirements
of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by Departmental Regulations in 516 DM 6, (49 FR 21438). As such, neither
an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Long- Term Strategy of Colorado's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for
Visibility Protection, as submitted by the Governor with a letter dated November 18, 1992. The revisions were made
to bring the SIP into compliance with the Federal visibility protection requirements for states containing mandatory
Class I Federal Areas, and to fulfill requirements to periodically review and, if necessary, revise the Long-Term
Strategy for visibility protection. EPA is also proposing to correct its error in a previous action on the State's
Visibility protection provisions.

Mandatory class I Federal areas are certain national parks, wildernesses and international parks described in section
162(a). These areas are the responsibility of ``Federal land managers'' (FLMs), the Secretary of the department
with authority over such lands. See section 302(i) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA promulgated regulations that, in broad outline, required affected States to: (1) Coordinate development of
SIPs with appropriate Federal land managers; (2) develop a program to assess and remedy visibility impairment from
new and existing sources; and (3) develop a long-term strategy to assure reasonable progress toward the National
visibility goal. 45 FR 80084 (December 2, 1980) (codified at 40 CFR 51.300&hyph;51.307). The regulations provided
for the remedying of visibility impairment that is reasonably attributable to a single existing stationary facility
or small group of existing stationary facilities. These regualtions required that the SIPs provide for periodic
review and revisions, as appropriate, of the long-term strategy not less frequent than every three years, that the
review process include consultation with the appropriate FLMs and that the State report to the public and EPA a specified
assessment of its progress toward the National goal. See 40 CFR 51.306(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544) and November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132), EPA disapproved SIPs of states that failed to comply
with the requirements of, among others, the provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 (visibility general plan requirements),
51.305 (visibility monitoring), and 51.306 (visibility Long-Term Strategy). EPA also incorporated corresponding
Federal plans and regulations into the SIPs of these states pursuant to section 110(c)(1) of the Act. The Governor
of Colorado submitted a SIP revision for visibility protection on December 21, 1987, which met the criteria of 40 CFR
51.302, 51.305, and 51.306 and consisted of five major sections: existing impairment, new source review, consultation
with Federal land managers, monitoring strategy, and the long-term strategy. EPA approved this SIP revision in an

II. Revisions Submitted November 18, 1992
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its public hearing on August 20, 1992, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) adopted revisions to
the Long-Term Strategy of the Class I Visibility SIP and revisions concerning the Long-Term Strategy in Commission
Regulation No. 3. These revisions require the Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) to review the Long-Term Strategy
and report on visibility progress at regular intervals. In a letter dated November 18, 1992, the Governor of Colorado
submitted these revisions to EPA. These revisions were made to bring the plan into compliance with Federal regulation
and to fulfill the Federal and Colorado requirements to review and, if necessary, revise the Long-Term Strategy at
least every three years. This submittal updates the State's Visibility Long-Term Strategy and makes it consistent
with Federal requirements. Pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act, EPA found the submittal to be complete and so
notified the Governor in a letter dated January 15, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation No. 3 previously required a Long-Term Strategy review/revision report from the APCD to the AQCC every
three years following the effective date of the regulation (November 1987). The August 1992 Long-Term Strategy report
was the first to be completed by APCD and, therefore, was behind schedule in arriving at the AQCC (i.e., it should have
been prepared by 1990). The purpose of the regulatory change was to clarify, in light of the delay in submitting the
initial report, when subsequent Long-Term Strategy review and revision report cycles would occur. Without this
regulatory change, the next Long-Term Strategy review would have been due September 1993_approximately a year from
the adoption of the August 1992 report. To adjust the reporting schedule, the regulation was revised. The revision
indicates that the Long-Term Strategy report will be made available by September 1 at least every third year following
the submittal of the previous report. If the proposed approval of this revision is finalized by EPA, the submittal
of the next report by September 1, 1995 will be a federally-enforceable obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation No. 3 was also revised to clear up a discrepancy with EPA requirements regarding the scope of review of the
Long-Term Strategy. Among the items indicated for review in the previous version of the regulation was the ``progress
achieved in developing the components of the Long-Term Strategy.'' The State revised the language to indicate that
the Long-Term Strategy must be reviewed, among other things, to determine ``[t]he need for BART [Best Available Retrofit
Technology] to remedy existing impairment in an integral vista declared since plan approval.'' This change brings
the State's program into conformance with EPA regulations. See 40 CFR 51.306(c)(7). Declaration of an integral vista
allows for protection of visibility resources outside a mandatory Class I area affecting views from within the area.
See 40 CFR 51.301(n). The State has not identified any integral vistas at this time, but may do so in the future at its
discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this SIP revision consists of replacing the original Long-Term Strategy with the revised Long-Term Strategy
adopted by the State in August, 1992. The SIP revisions address when the Long-Term Strategy review is to be completed,
factors to be assessed in periodic Long-Term Strategy reviews, and components of the Long-Term Strategy plan (e.g.,
existing impairment, prevention of future impairment, smoke management practices, Federal land manager consultation
and communication, and annual visibility data reports).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a February 18, 1993 letter from Doug Skie, EPA, to Paul Frohardt, APCD, EPA requested additional information to
determine the approvability of the SIP revisions. From a technical standpoint, EPA found the Long-Term Strategy
review and report complete and fully approvable. However, the revision to the timing of the reporting schedule raised
some concerns. According to Federal regulation (40 CFR 51.306), ``[t]he plan must provide for periodic review and
revision, as appropriate, of the long- term strategy not less frequent than every three years.'' Colorado's reviews
should have occurred in 1990, 1993, 1996, and so forth. The August 20, 1992 review and report were nearly two years late.
Rather than conducting another review in 1993, the revision changed the schedule to provide for review at least every
third year following the submittal of the previous report. Therefore, since the first report was prepared in 1992,
the reviews would occur in 1992, 1995, 1998, and so forth. In effect, only two reviews/reports would be submitted to
EPA through 1996, when three reports should have been provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the State committed in a March 5, 1993 letter to Doug Skie, EPA, to prepare and submit a brief informal status
report on the Long-Term Strategy by November, 1993. In this way, the State will have provided three reports through
the 1996 timeframe (1992, 1993, 1995). The State fulfilled its commitment by submitting to EPA an informal Long-Term
Strategy status report dated December 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State believes that the Long-Term Strategy revisions to the Visibility SIP will provide for continued Class I
visibility protection in Colorado, as well as bring the SIP into conformance with Federal requirements for Long-
Term Strategy review. This action was requested by the State of Colorado. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing, under section 110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act, to correct the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a) (``Visibility
protection''). This provision incorrectly states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures
for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When EPA initially approved the general elements of Colorado's visibility protection program on August 12, 1988
(53 FR 30428), the State's visibility new source review (NSR) regulations had not yet been approved. Therefore, the
program disapproval of 40 CFR 52.344(a), quoted above, which had been adopted on July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544), was retained.
Colorado's visibility NSR regulations were approved on December 1, 1988 as to industrial source categories for which
EPA had approved Colorado's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and nonattainment NSR permit requirements
(53 FR 48537). For other sources, for which Colorado did not have approved PSD and nonattainment NSR regulations,
EPA disapproved the State's visibility NSR regulations and continued to implement Federal regulations in 40 CFR
52.26 and 52.28, as incorporated into the Colorado SIP. This exception to approval is noted in 40 CFR 52.344(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of approval of the visibility NSR regulations, the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a), relating to over-all
program disapproval, should have been revised to indicate that Colorado's visibility protection program was approved,
with the exception of visibility NSR as it applied to certain industrial source categories. With this notice, EPA
proposes to correct section 52.344(a) to accurately reflect the status of program approval in Colorado.

III. Implications of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has reviewed the adequacy of Colorado's Long-term strategy review and revisions relative to its date of adoption
in 1992. EPA is proposing to approve Colorado's revision to the Long-Term Strategy of the Class I Visibility Protection
SIP, as submitted by the Governor with a letter dated November 18, 1992. EPA is also proposing to approve revisions
to Colorado AQCC Regulation No. 3 to bring it into conformance with Federal requirements for the Long-Term Strategy
and to revise the reporting schedule. EPA proposes to determine that these revisions are consistent with applicable
Federal requirements for Long-Term Strategy review under the Clean Air Act's visibility protection program for
mandatory Class I Federal Areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to correct its error in failing to accurately reflect Colorado's Visibility SIP approval status
in a previous action on the State's Visibility protection provisions.

IV. Request for Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will consider
any comments received by June 13, 1994.

V. Executive Order (EO) 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Regulatory Flexibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Standards implementing two provisions of the Clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Act (the Act) are being proposed by today's notice. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set of standards is proposed under section 183(f) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would limit air emissions of volatile organic compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing marine tank vessel loading and unloading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. These standards would require the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reasonably available control technology (RACT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An additional set of standards is proposed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d) of the Act and would limit air emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP from new and existing marine tank vessel loading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unloading operations. These proposed national emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require existing and new major sources to control emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the maximum achievable control technology (MACT).

A. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1982, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) began working with the EPA regarding
the establishment of Federal regulations under the Clean Air Act pertaining to air pollutants emitted from commercial
marine vessels. The MARAD raised concerns regarding the potential disruption of interstate and foreign commerce
and safety problems that may result from State regulation of marine vessel emissions. The MARAD believed that the
most appropriate method to control these emissions without causing undue disruption of commerce or safety problems
would be for the EPA to promulgate national standards regulating air pollutants from these sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1985, the U.S. Department of Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that the National Academy of Sciences' National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research Council (NRC) evaluate the feasibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling emissions from marine tank vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. At that time, many States were already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering vapor controls for barge and tankship loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tankship ballasting. The NRC Commission on Engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Technical Systems (CETS) then convened a Committee on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control and Recovery of Hydrocarbon Vapors from Ships and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Barges. This committee operated under the guidance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marine Board of the NRC. The committee and the Marine Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisted of members of industry and academia and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives. The Coast Guard (U.S. Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transportation) and the EPA also worked with the committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the feasibility study. In 1987, the committee issued its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report ``Controlling Hydrocarbon Emissions From Tank Vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loading'' (Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;I&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Marine Board's report determined that controls were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technically feasible but that there was a need for the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard to promulgate safety requirements and a need for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to set uniform emissions standards to mitigate some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety issues that could arise from varied State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The report recommended that the Coast Guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``lead the development and implementation of a coordinated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to ensure the safety and standardization of maritime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbon vapor emissions controls.'' The Coast Guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be responsible for the safety issues involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(standardized equipment, detonation arrestors, personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, etc.), and the EPA would be responsible for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions standards. One of the methods suggested to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve the coordination necessary to develop standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine tank vessel loading operations was an amendment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part of the Marine Board's task was to develop cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates. The Marine Board contracted United Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Design (UTD) to develop cost estimates for three different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model terminals and four model vessels. These model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals and costs served as the basis for the EPA costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;I&hyph;5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NRC recommendation, the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard's Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formed a Subcommittee on Vapor Control to develop standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for designing and operating vapor control systems. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CTAC subcommittee presented its final recommendations to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coast Guard in February 1989. The Coast Guard standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe design, installation, and operation of marine vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery equipment were promulgated in June 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(55 FR 2596). The Coast Guard regulations are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33 CFR part 154 and 46 CFR part 39.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the NRC recommendation, Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) added a new section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Act, section 183(f), that requires the EPA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgate standards applicable to emissions of VOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other air pollutants resulting from the loading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unloading of tank vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 amendments also revised section 112 of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require the EPA to publish a list of categories of major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources and area sources of listed HAP and to promulgate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions standards for each listed category of emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. In the Agency's initial list of categories of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources to be regulated under section 112(c) of the Act, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel loading and unloading source category was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed because the Agency intended to regulate the emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HAP as well as VOC under the authority of section 183(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act (57 FR 31566, July 16, 1992). After publication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this initial list of source categories, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to regulate HAP emissions from major sources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel loading and unloading facilities under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of section 112 of the Act (58 FR 60021, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 12, 1993).

1. Clean Air Act Section 183(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 183(f) of the Act requires the Administrator, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in consultation with the Secretary of the Department in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Coast Guard is operating, to
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Promulgate standards applicable to the emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of VOC and any other air pollutant from loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and unloading of tank vessels (as that term is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 2101 of title 46 of the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Code) which the Administrator finds causes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or contributes to, air pollution that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably anticipated to endanger public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or welfare. Such standards shall require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of reasonably available control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology, considering costs, any non-air-quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits, environmental impacts, energy

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act further directed the Administrator to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the standards, to the extent practicable, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading and unloading facilities and not to tank vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards were to be promulgated within 2 years after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enactment of the amended Act and must be effective within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 years of promulgation. The Coast Guard was directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue regulations ``to insure the safety of the equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations which are to control emissions from the loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and unloading of tank vessels *&blank;*&blank;*.''

2. Clean Air Act Section 112 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title III of the 1990 amendments revised section 112 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act to reduce the amount of nationwide air toxics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Under title III, section 112 was amended to give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA the authority to establish national standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce air toxics from industries that generate these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Section 112(b) contains a list of 189 HAP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of which are to be regulated. Specific HAP on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list include benzene (including benzene from gasoline), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toluene, and hexane. Section 112(c) directs the EPA to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of major and area sources of the pollutants on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HAP list. National emissions standards for hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air pollutants (NESHAP) will be developed for each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories on that list. The list of source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 (57 FR 31576) and was revised to include marine vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading and unloading operations on November 12, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 60021). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from both new and existing major and area sources according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the statutory directives set out in section 112(d) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. (Section 112(a) defines a major source as any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary source or group of stationary sources located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a contiguous area and under common control that emits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or has the potential to emit considering control, 10 tons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year or more of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of HAP. An area source is any stationary source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is not considered ``major''.) The statute requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of HAP that is achievable for new or existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. This control level is referred to as the ``maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achievable control technology (MACT)'', the selection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which must reflect consideration of the cost of achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emission reduction, any nonair quality health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts, and energy requirements for control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels more stringent than the MACT floors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT floor is the minimum stringency level for MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. For new sources, MACT must be no less stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the level of emission control already achieved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice by the best controlled similar source. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing sources, MACT must be no less stringent than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 percent of existing sources or the best performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 sources in categories or subcategories with fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the floor has been determined for new or existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must set MACT standards that ``shall require the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of emission reduction of the hazardous air pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to this section *&blank;*&blank;* that the Administrator, taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission

reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental

impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new or existing sources *&blank;*&blank;*.'' These standards must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be no less stringent than the MACT floor. Such standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must then be met by all sources within the category or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategory. In establishing standards, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a category or subcategory.

1. Process Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marine tank vessel loading operations are facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that load and unload liquid commodities (e.g., crude oil, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, toluene, alcohols, fuel oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numbers 2 and 6, some chemicals, and groups of solvents or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petrochemical products, etc.) in bulk. The cargo is pumped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the terminal's large, above-ground storage tanks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a network of pipes and into a storage compartment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(tank) on the vessel. Most marine tank vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations are associated with petroleum refineries or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synthetic organic chemical manufacturers, or are independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gasoline, crude oil, and other VOC- and HAP-emitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities are normally delivered from refinery to terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or terminal to terminal via pipeline, ship, or barge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During marine tank vessel loading operations, emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result as the liquid that is being loaded into the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displaces vapors from the vessel's tank. The vapors emitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fall into two categories: Arrival emissions and generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Arrival emissions are attributed to any vapors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining in the otherwise empty cargo tanks prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading. Generated emissions refer to vapors resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evaporation of the liquid cargo as it is loaded. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of arrival vapors to generated vapors can vary greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending upon the liquid, vapor pressure, loading method, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and loading conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major emission points for marine vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations include open tank hatches and overhead vent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. Overhead vent systems collect vapors displaced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during loading and route them to a vertical pipe or stack. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The vapors are released well above the height of the deck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an upward velocity to help isolate the vapors from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deck. Other possible emission points are hatch covers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domes, pressure-vacuum relief valves, seals, and vents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions may also occur during ballasting, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process of drawing ballast (i.e., water) into a cargo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold. When ballast is loaded into tanks that contain vapors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the preceding cargo, the vapor is displaced and emitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel. Most tankships carrying crude oil built 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since 1980 are required by domestic law and international 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement to use segregated ballast tanks, which prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of ballast emissions (see also: The Port and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tanker Safety Act (1978), the Act to Prevent Pollution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ships (1980), the Marine Vapor Control System Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(55 FR 25396, June 21, 1990); and the Double Hull Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Tank Vessels Carrying Oil (57 FR 36221, August 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992). However, some older and smaller tankships may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt from these requirements. Inland barges do not carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Control Technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The description of control technologies has two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, the capture of vapors and the destruction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of VOC and HAP. The capture of vapors at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel requires that the compartments on both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankships and barges be closed to the atmosphere during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading. Most tankships are already equipped for closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading as a result of having inert gas systems on board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because closed loading is necessary to maintain the legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required minimum inert gas pressure in the cargo tanks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Coast Guard regulations (46 CFR 32.53 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46 CFR 153.500). Barges generally do not use inert gas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are usually open loaded. Equipment necessary for closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading includes (1) devices to protect tanks from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underpressurization and overpressurization, (2) level-monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and alarm systems to prevent overfilling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) devices for cargo gauging and sampling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The vapor emissions captured from marine tank vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading operations can be controlled using one of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary methods: Combustion or recovery. Combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices include flares, enclosed flares, and thermal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic incinerators. The primary recovery methods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorption, absorption, vapor balancing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration. (For a more complete discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture and control techniques, consult the technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support document (TSD) previously mentioned in the

II. Summary of the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following summarizes the proposed standards. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full discussion of the rationale underlying these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is found in part III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Source Category To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The source category to be regulated is major source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations will require those operations exceeding certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline or crude oil throughput cutoffs or certain HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions cutoff at major sources to install vapor control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. Approximately 300 marine tank vessel loading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unloading operations would be affected by these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Vessels loading at affected sources must meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor tightness criteria in order to load product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source category includes only emissions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly caused by the loading and unloading of bulk liquids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at points where marine terminal equipment is connected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel sources. Thus, this source category does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include storage tanks and leaking equipment associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal transfer operations. Nor does this source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include emissions from offshore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer operations (i.e., lightering operations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lightering operations do not take place at onshore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals. The Agency may consider addressing lightering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations in a separate source category.

B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pollutants to be regulated are all VOC and HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitted during marine tank vessel loading and unloading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards are developed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 183(f) and 112(d) of the Act. As discussed above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 183(f) requires the promulgation of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing reasonably available control technology (RACT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(d) requires the promulgation of maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achievable control technology (MACT), which is selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using different criteria than are used for determining RACT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, RACT standards developed under section 183(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have somewhat different applicability criteria, as well as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different level of emissions reduction, compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d) MACT standards. However, the majority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (e.g., reporting, recordkeeping, performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, monitoring) are identical. In order to simplify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory process, both sets of standards, RACT and MACT, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are presented in a single regulation and proposed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 63.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing and new sources exceeding either of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughput cutoffs of 790 million liters per year (L/yr) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 million barrels per year (bbl/yr)) of gasoline or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 billion L/yr (100 million bbl/yr) of crude oil must meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RACT requirement of capture and control of vapors from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel loading operations. The EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 25 terminals will be required to install 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls under these proposed standards. The RACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel loading operations is a capture system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisting of a vapor tight marine vessel and all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piping and equipment necessary to route all VOC vapors to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device connected to either a thermal destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device or a recovery device. If a thermal destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device is used to process vapors, 98 percent destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency must be achieved. If a recovery device is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to process the vapors, 95 percent recovery must be achieved, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or as an alternative, for recovery of gasoline vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, a source must ensure an outlet concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Proposed MACT Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New marine vessel loading operations exceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 megagram per year (Mg/yr) (1.1 tons per year) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontrolled HAP emissions that are located at major sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must meet the MACT requirement of capture and control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors from marine vessel loading operations. The MACT for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new marine vessel loading operations is a capture system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisting of a vapor tight marine vessel and all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piping and equipment necessary to route all VOC vapors to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device that is capable of reducing HAP emissions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the atmosphere by 98 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing marine vessel loading operations exceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 1 Mg/yr of HAP emissions that are located at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major sources must meet the same vessel tightness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements as new sources. The EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 300 terminals will be affected by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards. These operations will have a MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions requirement of 93 percent emission reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control devices used to achieve this emission limit are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to operate at 95- and 98 percent removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies respectively. However, these facilities have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the option of exempting emissions of one or more commodities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from control provided an overall 93 percent emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction is achieved. This overall emission reduction may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be demonstrated by controlling all but a few commodities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loaded. Partial control of any given commodity would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed under the proposed compliance provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At both new and existing sources, emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballasting operations would be prohibited. Emissions of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from steam stripping used to regenerate carbon beds when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorption is used to control emissions from marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel loading operations would also be prohibited under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Source Reduction and Recycling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq., ER 71:0501) establishes the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution prevention hierarchy as national policy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Pollution should be prevented or reduced at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source wherever feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Pollution that cannot be prevented should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycled in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be treated in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Disposal or other release into the environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be employed only as a last resort and should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in an environmentally safe manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution prevention means ``source reduction,'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined under the Pollution Prevention Act, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants. Source reduction is any practice that reduces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of any hazardous substance entering the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, treatment, or disposal. Source reduction does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include any practice which alters the physical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or activity which itself is not integral to and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the production of a product or the providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a service. Under the Pollution Prevention Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, energy recovery, treatment and disposal are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included within the definition of pollution prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some practices commonly described as ``in-process recycling'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may qualify as pollution prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution prevention principles have been incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the proposed marine vessel standards. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition of emissions from ballasting and steam stripping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations has the effect of preventing pollution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring at the source. Alternative processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., segregated ballast tanks and vacuum regeneration) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily available, widely used, and have the benefit of not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting in HAP or VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not considered pollution prevention, vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery and recycling is a common practice in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, particularly gasoline recovery (the lower vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure crude oils are less conducive to recovery and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely to foul the carbon bed). The proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage vapor recovery by allowing the use of well- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated and maintained recovery devices that operate at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95-percent emission reduction. Recovery devices are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable compared to combustion devices because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovered compounds can be reused in other processes, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the quantity of virgin materials that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced. Recovery devices also tend to generate fewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary pollution impacts than do combustion devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Emission Points To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission points to be regulated include all means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of venting the tank during loading of product or ballast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These include, but are not limited to, open hatches and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhead vent systems. The proposed rulemakings will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly regulate seals, hatches, or covers associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the marine tank vessel. However, these items must be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory condition for the vessel to pass one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three different marine tank vessel tightness tests, and must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain closed during the loading process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Format for the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The chosen format for the standards for product loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a percentage of mass emissions reduction. An alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format for gasoline vapor recovery, a maximum allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration for the vapor processor exhaust is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed. Emissions are prohibited from ballasting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations and from regeneration of carbon adsorber beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Compliance Deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The compliance deadline for existing sources affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the RACT standards is 2 years after the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation. The compliance deadline for existing sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the MACT standards is 2 years after the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation. An existing source that subsequently exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a RACT throughput cutoff will have 2 years to comply once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source exceeds a throughput cutoff. Similarly, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source that exists as of the effective date of the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and subsequently exceeds the MACT applicability thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have 2 years to comply with the existing source MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. All other new or reconstructed facilities will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to comply upon startup, with the exceptions noted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;63.6 of the part 63 General Provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Initial Performance Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators must perform initial performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests as required by &sect;63.7 of the General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all combustion or recovery devices except devices such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as boilers or process heaters where the emissions stream is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the primary fuel or boilers and process heaters having a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or more. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test method for compliance for combustion devices is the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 25 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The test method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance for recovery devices is the EPA Method 25A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. Flares are not subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same tests as other control devices, but must pass a visible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions test according to the requirements of Method 22 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The performance tests must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted to include the loading of the last 20 percent of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compartment, and may be spread out over multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compartments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Vessel Tightness Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three alternatives to ensure vessel tightness are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed: (1) Pressure test the vessel, (2) perform a leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test on all components using Method 21 of appendix A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60, or (3) load the vessel at less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators using a vent system that contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must either monitor vent stream flow to ensure that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not diverted from a control device or secure the bypass line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valve in the closed position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring criteria have been established for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion devices (except flares), carbon adsorbers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensers and adsorbers. In general, facilities would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to establish operating parameters during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial performance test and then monitor combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature for combustion devices, VOC concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust stream outlet for carbon adsorbers, exhaust stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature for condensers, and VOC outlet concentration for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adsorbers. In the case of flares, owners or operators would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be required to monitor for the continuous presence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flame and to monitor vent stream flow. Owners or operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking to use other types of control devices may develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhanced monitoring criteria for these devices and submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria to the Administrator for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Recordkeeping and Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sources required to install controls would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 63 General Provisions including submittal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following reports: (1) Compliance notification report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) notification of initial performance test, (3) report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial performance test, (4) quarterly parameter exceedance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report, and (5) quarterly emissions estimation report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These sources must also maintain documentation that vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loaded at the facility are vapor tight. All information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be made readily available to the Administrator or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegated State authority for a minimum of 5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of Affected Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary release of vapors during the marine tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel loading process occurs at the tank vessel through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hatches, vents, and vent systems. However, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impractical for marine tank vessels to carry their own vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing systems given the limited space on individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels. It is also much more economical for terminals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
install and operate control devices that are capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling emissions from multiple vessels than for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel to control its own emissions. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 183(f) requires that ``to the extent practicable such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards shall apply to loading and unloading facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and not to tank vessels.'' Therefore, these regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that terminals install an air pollution control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and a means of routing the air/vapor mixture from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel to the air pollution control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessels will not be allowed to load or unload product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless they are compatible with terminal air pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control systems or have a self contained emissions control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system on board. Therefore, vessels loading at a controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal will need to have their own vapor collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems (i.e., pipes which allow for connection to terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air pollution control system) in order to route vapors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shore. However, vessels are not required to load at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled terminals. As a result, the affected source is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the terminal, which is in turn required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture and control all loading emissions, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of ballasting and off-shore terminal emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are discussed elsewhere in this preamble. Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from off shore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations (i.e., lightering operations) are also not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included as a source affected by these standards because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these operations do not take place at onshore terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Selection of Pollutants To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 183(f) of the Act states that the Administrator shall ``promulgate standards applicable to the emission
of VOC and any other pollutant from loading and unloading of tank vessels which the Administrator finds causes, or
contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'' Under section
112(d), the EPA is also required to regulate the emissions of HAP from source categories listed pursuant to section
112(c). Marine vessel loading operations were listed on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 60021). In the absence of regulation,
the EPA estimates that 75,200 Mg/yr of VOC will be emitted as a result of tank vessel loading operations. Approximately
8,000 Mg/yr of these VOC emissions will be emissions of HAP. Tank vessel loading operations emit approximately 53
different substances listed as HAP under section 112(b) of the Act. Such emissions include unregulated benzene emissions
of about 700 Mg/yr. In addition, approximately 6,900 Mg/yr of hexane, toluene, xylene compounds, ethyl benzene,
iso-octane, MTBE, naphthalene, and cumene are emitted from tank vessel loading operations. Approximately 44 HAP
comprise the remaining four percent of toxic emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzene is a known human carcinogen. It has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of nonlymphocytic leukemia
in occupationally exposed individuals. It has also been linked to other leukemias, as well as lymphomas and other
tumor types in animal studies. Benzene has also been associated with a number of adverse noncancer health effects,
including effects on the blood system and the immune system. The other HAP identified above also may induce adverse
health effects, including depression of the central nervous system, upper respiratory tract and eye irritation,
skeletal abnormalities, anemia, cataracts, kidney damage and liver damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of its authority to regulate emission from tank vessel loading operations under both section 183(f) and
section 112(d), the EPA shall regulate emissions of VOC and those HAP included on the list under section 112(b) in this
rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Selection of Basis and Level of the RACT Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Development of Regulatory Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In deciding how to implement the RACT provisions of section 183(f), the EPA had to determine whether or not all tank
vessel loading terminals should be subject to the standards (i.e., whether there should be ``cutoffs'' below which
a terminal would not be subject to the standards) and what level of control would be appropriate. Consistent with the
requirements of section 183(f) calling for the consideration of costs and other non-air quality impacts, as well
as the general requirements under RACT to review economic feasibility, the EPA believes that section 183(f) gives
the EPA the flexibility to determine the level and scope of regulation that is most appropriate for terminal facilities,
given all of the factors indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming 100 percent capture of emissions (which can be assumed when vapor tight vessels are loaded), the overall
level of control is determined by the efficiency of the control device to which emissions are ducted. Currently, recovery
devices (e.g., carbon adsorption, absorption, vapor balancing and refrigeration) are capable of achieving a 95
percent efficiency compared to a 98 percent efficiency achieved by thermal destruction (combustion) devices (e.g.,
flares, enclosed flares, and thermal and catalytic incinerators). Additional information and descriptions of
these control technologies are found in the TSD for this rulemaking (see

 section). For purposes of the regulatory alternative analysis, the use of a thermal destruction device (i.e., 98
percent efficiency) was assumed. The control technologies selected for this regulation are discussed in part 4 below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step was to identify regulatory alternatives that would allow the EPA to choose among different optimal cutoffs
specifying what types of terminals would have to install control devices. The EPA chose commodity and throughput
as factors to distinguish among alternatives because commodities with higher vapor pressures have higher emissions
and, for a given commodity, terminals with higher throughput loading similar vessels have higher emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 is a summary of the five regulatory alternatives developed by the EPA. The regulatory alternatives varied
in stringency from controlling all emissions at all facilities to controlling only gasoline loadings at terminals
with annual throughputs greater than 1,590 million liters (10 million bbl/yr) and crude oil terminals with throughputs
greater than 15,900 million liters/yr (100 million bbl/yr). The control levels are all based on the capture of loading
emissions from marine vessels and a 98 percent removal efficiency. Each regulatory alternative is structured such
that the emissions and resulting cost-effectiveness values from each commodity at the stated throughput are roughly
equivalent. For example, the costs of controlling emissions from 10 million barrels of gasoline is treated as being
roughly equivalent to the costs of controlling emissions from 100 million barrels of crude oil because the emissions
per volume of gasoline is ten times higher than for crude oil. (For a more complete rationale behind the selection of
the regulatory alternatives, consult the technical support document (TSD) previously mentioned in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis leading to a decision to regulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from ballasting and steam stripping operations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in section D, Selection of MACT Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Impacts of the Regulatory Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA developed model (i.e., example) vessels and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals for use in estimating the environmental, cost, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts associated with the actual terminals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented by the waterborne commerce in the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(WCUS) data base. The impacts that resulted from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis are presented in Tables 1 through 3. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed an economic impact analysis of the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives considered for these regulations. Potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price, output, and employment impacts for affected products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and for the marine transport industry and for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses were examined. Estimated maximum price increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any product loaded in bulk varied but were not large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under any of the regulatory alternatives. These price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase estimates reflect the control cost increase for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both transporting crude and transporting refined products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the price increases are small and because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elasticities of demand for petroleum products are small, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal in all but Regulatory Alternative V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions were also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small (less than 20) in all but Regulatory Alternative V.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Because today's proposed regulation involves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of both RACT and MACT, impacts for each standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were determined separately. In order to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overestimation or double-counting, and because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for RACT are more stringent than MACT, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts for facilities affected by RACT (i.e., facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with gasoline throughputs of greater than 790 million L/yr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 million bbl/yr) or crude oil throughputs of greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 billion L/yr (100 million bbl/yr)) were calculated first, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and were discounted when determining the impacts for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities affected by MACT (i.e., facilities emitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than 1 Mg/yr of HAP).

3. RACT Threshold Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Administrator is proposing Regulatory Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II as the regulatory threshold for the RACT standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative II would require controls for crude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil loadings at facilities with an crude oil marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughput of approximately 15,900 L/yr (100 million bbl/yr) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more, and gasoline loadings at facilities with a gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughput of approximately 795 million L/yr (5 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bbl/yr). Approximately 25 terminals (1.5 percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals) will be affected if the thresholds for Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative II are implemented. In addition, under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative, only a small volume of U.S. marine vessels will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be retrofitted. It is anticipated that only those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels that are least costly to retrofit would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofitted. Approximately 76 percent of the VOC emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from all marine terminals would be controlled at an average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost effectiveness of approximately $770/Mg of VOC reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Regulatory Alternative II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator believes that the incremental cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness ($5,000/Mg) of going beyond Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative II is inappropriate given this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative III was strongly considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the additional 35 terminals controlled under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative III would produce only an additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight percent reduction in nationwide emissions. Of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35 additional terminals, as many as 25 could be under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased competitive pressure, compared to only up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five terminals under Regulatory Alternative II. (Increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitive pressure refers to the situation where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled terminal is in direct competition with a much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller or larger terminal. The smaller terminal may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled and the larger terminal may be able to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors more effectively on a per-barrel basis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled terminal could be forced to absorb some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control costs, reduce throughput, substitute nonregulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, or close the facility.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the more stringent regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives considered involved control of commodities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have vapor pressures much lower than gasoline and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crude oil. Emissions generally correspond to the vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure of the commodity being loaded. Gasoline and crude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil generally have the highest vapor pressures, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore present better control alternatives. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic and other environmental impacts of Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative II are reasonable and should not place an undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden on industry or the environment, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected Regulatory Alternative II as representative of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RACT.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Control of marine vessel loading emissions requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture of displaced vapors and efficient control of vapors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once captured. Vessels loading at facilities with controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must install a vapor collection system and pass one of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank vessel tightness alternatives to ensure good capture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors. The tightness alternative may be one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: (1) A leak check performed during loading on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components using Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) a pressure test, where the internal tanks are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized and the pressure drop is monitored over time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if the vessel is tight; or (3) for noninerted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels (i.e., vessels having tanks that are not blanketed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with nonreactive gas during loading to ensure that vapors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tanks are below the explosive range), load the vessel at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than atmospheric pressure. These tightness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives are the same as those promulgated in the NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for benzene (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). The EPA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have sufficient data necessary to determine at what point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel leaks affect the operation and efficiency of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control system; however, the Agency believes that the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tightness alternatives proposed are sufficient to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the collection of nearly all displaced vapors. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that once assured of good capture and collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vapors through the tightness tests, facilities can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrate on the operation and maintenance of the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device as a means of ensuring compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing that vapor emissions captured from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine tank vessel loading operations can be controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using one of two primary methods: Combustion or recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary devices used for combustion of vapors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flares, enclosed flares (often referred to as thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxidizers), catalytic incinerators, and thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators. The primary methods for recovery of vapors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include carbon adsorption, absorption, refrigeration, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor balancing. In States with marine tank vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that allow both combustion and recovery, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control devices are evenly split between enclosed flares and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorption.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The EPA is proposing that standards for the control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors captured during the loading operations be one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: (1) A combustion device meeting 98 percent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater destruction efficiency or (2) A recovery device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting 95 percent or greater recovery efficiency. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in control efficiencies between recovery and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion is designed to not prohibit recovery systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have smaller secondary air emission (sulfur dioxide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrous oxides, and carbon monoxide) impacts than combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. The smaller emissions reduction is also warranted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these emissions are recovered as product instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed. Additionally, the EPA has data supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95- and 98-percent control efficiencies as achievable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery and combustion devices, respectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, items II&hyph;A&hyph;7 and II&hyph;B&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For terminals that use recovery devices for control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline vapor emissions, the EPA is proposing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative means of compliance. Such sources can comply by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring an outlet concentration of 1,000 ppmv or less for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from gasoline loadings. The EPA believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 ppmv limit for gasoline vapor is generally more strict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the 95 percent reduction requirement. Data from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing facility show this limit to be achievable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;B&hyph;13). The intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration alternative is to allow those facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate at a higher efficiency than required by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to perform a simpler compliance test, as they would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only have to test at the outlet of the control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the lower emission factors associated with crude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil emissions, the fact that hydrogen sulfide present in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crude oil may poison the activated carbon, and that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no known facilities controlling crude oil emissions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorbers, the EPA is not proposing a concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative for controlling vapors from crude oil emissions.

5. Impacts of the Proposed RACT Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The environmental, costs, energy, and economic impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed RACT standards are summarized in Tables 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 3, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They are also discussed in parts C.2. and C.3. above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Economic effects of the proposed RACT standards include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum price increase of approximately 0.2 percent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide employment reductions of less than fifty. Up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five terminals controlled under the proposed standards could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be under increased competitive pressure. Economic effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on oil tankers include an average control cost per barrel of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crude oil loaded equal to $0.002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A primary concern in the implementation of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards is safety. Section 183(f)(1) dictates that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA consult with the Coast Guard and consider safety when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgating these standards. Section 183(f)(2) states:

Regulations on Equipment Safety._Within 6 months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1990, the Secretary of the Department in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Coast Guard is operating shall issue regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the safety of the equipment and operations which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to control emissions from the loading and unloading of tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, under section 3703 of title 46 of the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code and section 6 of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(33 U.S.C. 1225). The standards promulgated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator under paragraph (1) and the regulations issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a State or political subdivision regarding emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loading and unloading of tank vessels shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the regulations regarding safety of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department in which the Coast Guard is operating.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Coast Guard regulations (55 FR 25396) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated in June 1990, before the passage of the amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. These standards dictate equipment, system, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational requirements for vapor control systems for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene, gasoline, and crude oil. The EPA has maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication with the Coast Guard throughout the rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. All control systems installed as a result of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation would be subject to the Coast Guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, and nothing in the proposed standard should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construed as to require any act or omission that would be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of any regulation or other requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Coast Guard or prevent any act or omission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to secure the safety of a vessel or for saving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life at sea. Representatives from the United States Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard have participated in all phases of the development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposed rules. The EPA is confidant that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are consistent with the Coast Guard regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the safety factors have been adequately addressed.

At one time, the Agency was considering planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulating based exclusively under the authority of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
183(f). During this time, the Agency held a public meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to discuss a possible approach for considering a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment/non-attainment status with respect to NAAQS ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and a facility's site specific risk to the public in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the standards (see Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;E&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach would have required intensive effort on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the Agency and the regulated community to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable criteria and technological methodologies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating whether the criteria have been met. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regulation under section 112, any facility that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been exempted from RACT under section 183(f) with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach discussed at the public meeting would ultimately be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Area Source Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The HAP emitted from this source category include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene, toluene, hexane, xylene, and ethylbenzene from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline and crude oil loading as well as approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 HAP from alcohols and specialty chemicals. Of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 1,800 marine vessel terminals in this source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, at least 60 emit 25 ton/year of HAP or more, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are therefore considered major sources. In addition, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(a)(1), a marine vessel terminal may be a part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a major source if it is part of a ``group of stationary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources located within a contiguous area and under common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control that emits or has the potential to emit considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of hazardous air pollutants.'' There are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 600 refineries and chemical production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities in the United States; all of these are considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be major sources. While the Agency does not have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data in its marine vessel data base to estimate how many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities have bulk marine loading terminals that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contiguous to and under the same control as the main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, there is a high correlation between large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refineries and production facilities and large bulk loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals. Therefore, at a minimum, for purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, the Agency assumed that approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
300 terminals are major sources because they are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be located at major sources such as refineries or chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production facilities. This leaves approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,200 facilities that are considered likely area sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the emissions data contained in the Agency's data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base, these 1,200 facilities represent only 2 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide HAP emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(c)(3) states that categories of area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources emitting HAP may be listed and regulated if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator finds the sources, individually or in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate, present a threat of adverse effects to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment. Based on limited data available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Agency, the Administrator is unable to determine a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threat of adverse effects at this time. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency is proposing not to regulate such area sources in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking. This is consistent with the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision not to include in its initial list of source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories those categories that contained no major sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and for which the Agency had not made a finding of threat of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects (57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992). The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may, however, revisit these sources in the future, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional data become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Determination of Subcategories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The source category to be regulated is major sources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessel loading and unloading operations. As part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NESHAP development process, the source category was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated to determine if subcategorization of the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category was justified. Although the Act does not specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria from which subcategories can be developed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d)(1) of the Act states that the ``Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a category or subcategory *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these same criteria are acceptable criteria to use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making subcategory determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Size appears to be a likely candidate for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishing feature, and using total estimated HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions as an indicator for size, the EPA evaluated marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank vessel loading operations to determine whether it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to subcategorize the source category on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of size. The limit for determining subcategories was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined in 0.5 Mg increments of HAP emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.5 Mg/yr to 2.0 Mg/yr. A subcategory based on 1 Mg of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP emissions per year was selected for the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons. First, facilities that emit less than 1 Mg of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are likely to be area sources and therefore not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the proposed standards, or are facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are represented by relatively minimal, episodic emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a typical river barge holds 10,000 barrels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
420,000 gallons of gasoline. An uncontrolled facility below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 1-Mg cutoff could be loading less than 30 barges per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These facilities also typically emit less frequently than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities emitting more than 1 Mg/yr and typically only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
load a single commodity. Additionally, these facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also tend to load (and therefore emit) commodities having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower vapor pressures than commodities loaded at other, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger, facilities. Also, facilities that emit 1 Mg or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HAP emissions contribute approximately 98 percent of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions to the national inventory. (See Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44)

3. Determination of the MACT Floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The MACT floors were determined for the following types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operations: Product loading and ballasting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Product loading.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The marine vessel data base is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on throughput data for marine vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals. The throughput data are divided into crude oil, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, and 11 other commodity categories. Additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on these data are available in the TSD for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble). The EPA estimated the emissions of HAP from each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these terminals using these throughput data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating assumptions about how many of these facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were controlled, and the extent of their control. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions are based on existing Federal and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. For example, benzene loadings are already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled by the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61, subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BB). In addition, four States have regulations requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of emissions from marine tank vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations: New Jersey, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California (District regulations). (Additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the derivation of the MACT floor is found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;A&hyph;44.) Additional discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's interpretation of the MACT floor is presented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section J. Solicitation of Comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the approximately 360 terminals estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the proposed regulation, 43 facilities comprise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the best performing 12 percent of facilities used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the MACT floor for terminals emitting over 1 Mg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HAP emissions. These terminals are subject to State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations in California, New Jersey, and Louisiana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Averaging the required control levels of these facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in a MACT floor of 93 percent control for facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitting more than 1 Mg of HAP per year. Although this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived average does not precisely match a control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology, for all practical purposes it is equivalent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction achieved by recovery techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., 95 percent). Additional information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivation of the MACT floor may be found in the docket for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed rulemaking effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,440 facilities that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emit less than 1 Mg of HAP emissions annually if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontrolled. The average control level of the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing 12 percent of facilities is 36 percent control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This control level does not represent an existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology. Therefore using the average of the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing 12 percent is inappropriate for establishing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor. Taking the median of the best performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 percent of these sources (94th percentile) results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control level of zero because the median facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontrolled. This is a more appropriate portrayal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of control that exists in this subcategory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this level of control (i.e., no control) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the MACT floor for terminals emitting less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 Mg/yr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT floor for new facilities, regardless of size, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a 98-percent overall control of emissions. This control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level represents the best performing similar source. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency will take comment on whether the MACT floor for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources could, consistent with the requirements of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112(d) of the Act, be equal to a control requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 percent when a recovery device is used. As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere in this preamble, the Agency wishes to encourage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of recovery devices. However, a 95 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction requirement for recovery devices may be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with the requirement of section 112(d)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act that emission standards for new sources shall not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less stringent than the emission control achieved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best controlled similar source. The EPA requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether the secondary benefits of recovery devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the Administrator with the ability to determine that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 95 percent reduction requirement for those sources using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery is ``not less stringent'' than a 98 percent reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for all other sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ballasting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 According to the Marine Board report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most tankships have segregated or clean ballast tanks due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coast Guard regulations and international agreements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively prohibit ballast emissions from occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Marine Board report was issued in 1987, as older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels have been retired, the proportion of ``uncontrolled'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels has decreased further. However, the Agency does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have any information available to it to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of vessels that still emit ballasting emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly those vessels that are not in crude oil service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(where the vast majority of ballasting occurs). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator determined that the MACT floor for ballasting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at new or existing sources would be a prohibition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballasting emissions. The Agency is requesting comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this decision to prohibit ballasting emissions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Product loading.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two regulatory alternatives were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for the subcategory represented by major source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emit less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP annually. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives are summarized in Table 4. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first alternative, Regulatory Alternative A, represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor of no control. Regulatory Alternative B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the control of a facility's total HAP throughput 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting in an overall emission reduction of 95 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two regulatory alternatives were considered for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategory represented by existing facilities emitting more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1 Mg of HAP per year. Regulatory Alternative A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the MACT floor level of control (93 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall control). Regulatory Alternative B represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of a facility's total HAP throughput to an overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of 95 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no regulatory alternatives for new facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that exceed the MACT floor of 98 percent control because no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other alternatives that are more stringent than the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were considered technically feasible.

Given the structure of the UTD cost estimates, distinctions between the costs at 93 percent and 95 percent emission
reduction were not possible. However, costs would be at least as high as those shown at the 93 percent emissions reduction
plus additional retrofit costs for vessels. (Retrofit costs for vessels range from $9,000 to $61,000.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Existing sources emitting 1 Mg/yr or less.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under Regulatory Alternative B, the average cost effectiveness to control existing facilities emitting less than
1 Mg/yr of HAP is approximately $3.4 million per Mg. The Administrator has determined that these costs are unreasonable
and, as a result, that MACT for the subcategory represented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing facilities with emissions less than or equal to 1 Mg per year of HAP emissions is equivalent to a MACT floor
of no control. This determination follows section 112(d) of the Act where the Administrator is required to consider
cost of achieving emission reductions beyond the MACT floor (among other criteria) when selecting MACT. These smaller
facilities represent only 2 percent of all industry-wide emissions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Existing sources emitting greater Than 1 Mg/yr.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administrator has determined that MACT for the subcategory represented by existing facilities with HAP emissions
exceeding 1 Mg per year is the MACT floor of 93 percent overall control. The incremental benefits of additional control
are not justified considering the costs of achieving these reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bulk of the incremental costs of control beyond the 93 percent emission limit (MACT floor) are the costs to retrofit
a sufficient number of vessels to capture emissions beyond those required at the MACT floor and supplemental operating
costs. Unfortunately, the Agency's marine vessel data base does not contain the type of data needed to analyze the
nationwide cost effectiveness of a more stringent alternative. However, the average cost per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to retrofit sufficient vessels to allow the facility to comply with the incremental emission reduction
required for that facility to meet standards beyond the MACT floor ranges from approximately $9,000 to $60,000 per
year. (Additional information on this analysis is found in Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II-A&hyph;23 and item
II-A&hyph;32). In addition, there may be substantial additional costs to the facility to equip additional emission
points (e.g., berths) with emission control equipment. The Administrator deems that any costs beyond the MACT floor,
which itself has a cost effectiveness of over $90,000 per Mg, would not be reasonable. (The statute itself precludes
the Administrator from selecting a less costly MACT floor.) Based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited analysis, the Administrator has elected to not require control beyond the MACT floor for this subcategory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selection of 93 percent emission limit as MACT for existing sources emitting greater than 1 Mg/yr should provide
flexibility to terminals that install control equipment that is expected to achieve 95 to 98 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions reduction. This flexibility enables facilities to control HAP emissions in the most efficient manner
by not requiring the control of liquids having minimal emissions. The Agency is soliciting comment on the need for
this flexibility, and on methods to ensure enforceability of these standards given this flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the EPA does not believe that the analysis performed above for MACT-regulated facilities is
applicable to the determination of RACT discussed in section III-C. The EPA believes that the incremental benefits
of controlling the MACT-regulated terminals above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93 percent control is unjustified, given the costs already associated with the MACT standard. On the other hand, the
RACT standards apply only to the largest crude oil and gasoline terminals in the United States. The cost effectiveness
associated with requiring 95 or 98 percent control at these facilities is considerably more favorable than that associated
with requiring 95 or 98 percent control for the MACT-regulated facilities. As shown above, the cost effectiveness
associated with the RACT standard is $2,100/Mg, considerably less than that for the MACT standard. Therefore, the
Agency believes that it is not appropriate to reduce the percent reduction requirements of the RACT standard to match
those of the MACT standard. The EPA recognizes that for some individual facilities regulated under both sections
112 and 183(f), the RACT standard may be more stringent than the MACT standard. The EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this result is appropriate, but the EPA is taking comment on this issue. The EPA also notes that the control equipment
required under both the MACT standard and the RACT standard must meet the 95 or 98 percent control threshold. The MACT
standard offers flexibility with regard to the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of liquids controlled, not the manner in which they are controlled.

New sources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that MACT for new facilities is the MACT floor, which is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall control requirement of 98 percent. However, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed above, the EPA will take comment on whether MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new facilities could, consistent with section 112(d) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, be equal to 95 percent reduction for recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices and 98 percent reduction for other destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ballasting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined impact of fleet turnover and Coast Guard and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory requirements for tankships to use segregated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballast tanks means that there should be no impacts from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control (i.e., prohibition) of ballast emissions. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, MACT was determined to be equivalent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition of emissions from ballasting. However, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in section J.2, Ballasting Emissions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator is soliciting comments and data on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of significant impacts to currently uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Selection of the Proposed MACT Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Product loading. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with the RACT standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels loading at facilities with controls must install a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor collection system and pass one of three tank vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tightness alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT standards for existing facilities are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a facility demonstrating that 93 percent of HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are controlled. Facilities would be allowed to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the standard is being met in one of two ways. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first case, a facility may choose to demonstrate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from all vessels being loaded at the facility are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being routed to either a 95 percent efficient recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device or a 98 percent efficient destruction device. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other case, the facility may opt to exclude the emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain vessels or process lines from control, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented emission estimates, so long as at least a 93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent overall level of control is achieved. The partial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of any commodity loaded or unloaded at the terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be allowed as a means of showing compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 93 percent overall emissions reduction standard. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility would still be required to demonstrate that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled emissions are being routed to either a 95 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient recovery device or a 98 percent efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT standards for new facilities require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions limit of 98 percent control. Additionally, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities would be required to maintain tank-tight vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while loading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ballasting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators of existing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to demonstrate compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ballasting standards by maintaining records showing that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels loaded met one of the following criteria: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel does not perform ballasting at any time, (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel meets the Coast Guard standards, or (3) ballasting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are ducted to a control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental, costs, energy and economic impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed MACT standards are summarized in Tables 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 6, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for facilities emitting less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Regulatory Alternative A for facilities emitting more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1 Mg of HAP. There are no projected impacts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling emissions from ballasting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section IV.C.5, the EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential safety impacts of the standards have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated impacts of the standards are a VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of 12,400 Mg/yr of which 1,300 Mg are HAP. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital and annualized costs are estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$570 million and $130 million, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT determination for this regulation. Potential price, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output, and employment impacts for affected producers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the marine transport industry were examined for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative. Potential small business impacts were also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isolated. Additional information on these economic impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available in the docket for this proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimated maximum price increases for the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products varied but were not large (less than 1 percent) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the products under Regulatory Alternative A of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These price increase estimates reflect both the control cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase for transporting crude oil and the control cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase for transporting petroleum products. Because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price increases are small and because the elasticity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand coefficients for petroleum products are small, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal. Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were also small (less than 200). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Regulatory Alternative A of the MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially significant economic impacts on the smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal operations that would have to install controls were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. These significant impacts may have resulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the high costs overall acting in combination with high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per-barrel control cost differentials between the smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and larger terminal operations that would have to control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that many of the smaller terminal operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be able to pass all of their control costs forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consumers since they would be under increased competitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure from the larger terminal operations. It was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated that up to 200 of the 264 affected terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations will have difficulty either absorbing control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs or passing along these costs to consumers under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential economic impact on marine vessel owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is relatively small. Average control cost per barrel for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tankers shipping crude oil or refined products was estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be $0.002 per barrel while owners or barges shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refined products would face control costs of $0.08 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrel. Because 77 percent of U.S. marine-transported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum product volume would be affected by these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, a significant percentage of U.S. marine vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will need to be retrofitted. The vessels least costly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify (most likely the larger, newer, double-skin vessels) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be retrofitted first, leading to a significant degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dedicated service. It is expected that vessel owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that do retrofit will be able to pass retrofit costs forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, a primary concern in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of these proposed regulations is safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though section 112 of the Act does not specifically address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Coast Guard regulations on safety, the EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endeavored to make sure that safety factors are adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed and that nothing in the proposed regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether proposed under section 183(f) or 112, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with current U.S. Coast Guard regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 183(f)(2) of the Act requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any regulations promulgated by any State or political 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unloading of tank vessels must be consistent with U.S. Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard regulations regarding safety. This consistency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is equally applicable to any State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act section 112. Moreover, section 112(l) requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator disapprove any program submitted by a State if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator determines that the program is not likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to satisfy the objectives of the Act. The EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any State or local program that is inconsistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Coast Guard safety regulations is ``not likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the objectives of the Act'' and would therefore be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Selection of Format for the Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The chosen format for the standards is a percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass emissions reduction. The percent of mass reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format allows a focus on the final control device after good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture has been ensured. This approach is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). Sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to develop a mass per unit loaded standard were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. Additionally, emission rates can vary between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and between vessels based on loading temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the arrival condition of the vessel, making it difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to set an acceptable mass per unit loaded standard while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring good capture and control. Developing a mass per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit loaded standard would have required extensive testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would need to be more stringent than the percent of mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction format in order to accommodate the varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal and vessel conditions. For this reason, a mass per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit loaded alternative is not being proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary format, mass emissions reduction, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT standards is the same as the RACT standards. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the MACT standards allow the source the flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to control only the portion of total facility emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to meet the 93 percent reduction requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities may choose to calculate both potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontrolled and actual controlled emissions as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance demonstration.

G. Selection of Test Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards require the use of approved test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to ensure consistent and verifiable results for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial performance tests and compliance demonstrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different test methods are specified for combustion and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery devices. For combustion devices, Method 25 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60, appendix A (Method 25) has been specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 25 is appropriate for measuring the VOC destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of combustion devices whose output is greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 50 ppmv. Given the large inlet concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with marine loadings, outlet concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 50 ppmv are not expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For recovery devices, (Method 25A) of 40 CFR part 60, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A (Method 25A) has been specified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Method 25A) is appropriate for measuring the VOC removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of a nondestructive control device. Method 25A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used for testing both removal efficiency and outlet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because emissions and control efficiency also vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the loading cycle, the EPA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance tests should be conducted to include the loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the last 20 percent of a compartment, and may be spread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out over multiple compartments. Data show that the greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions occur during the last 20 percent of loading of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank or compartment. The EPA believes that the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment should be designed to handle the peak loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, which occur during this period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards also allow the use of any test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method or test results validated according to the protocol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A to allow owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operators greater flexibility in testing.

Under today's proposed standards, owners or operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not having documentation of vessel vapor tightness would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to test the vapor tightness of vessels using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure test provided in the regulation, or a leak test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods are also provided for owners or operators loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under negative pressure. These test methods were first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for owners or operators of benzene transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations on September 14, 1989 (54 FR 38083) and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated on March 7, 1990 (55 FR 8292). In the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the benzene transfer operations NESHAP, comments were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requested regarding the suitability of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for these sources. Based on the comments received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these methods and the Agency's knowledge of the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these methods under the benzene transfer NESHAP, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is confident that these methods are suitable for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor tightness for today's proposed regulation.

Regarding the emission estimation procedures to be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, the Agency is proposing that facilities use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either actual test data or AP&hyph;42 emissions factors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify emissions from the various commodities and streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards list parameters to be monitored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the purpose of determining compliance. Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are proposed for both the vapor collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and control devices. The vapor collection system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements ensure that vent streams will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverted from the control device through the use of flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators or routine inspection of secured by-pass lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While many forms of monitoring may qualify as enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, enhanced monitoring for tank vessel loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor control systems will generally be limited to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous control device parameter monitoring system, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), portable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitors, or a combination thereof.

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The monitoring criterion for carbon adsorption is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CEMS for VOC concentration at the exhaust to atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance condition will be no exceedance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average concentration demonstrated during the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last compliance test. This monitoring criteria does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correspond precisely to the 95 percent reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, however it will be less costly to install and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain than a system monitoring inlet and outlet and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating removal efficiency.

The monitoring parameter for combustion devices, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flares, is combustion temperature. Combustion temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a strong indicator of performance. The temperature to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained will be determined from the facility's compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. For compliance purposes, temperature variation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to

temperature during the most recent compliance test.

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The monitoring parameter for condensers is the exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream temperature. Exhaust temperature directly correlates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to exhaust concentration and is easier to monitor than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlet concentration. Coolant temperature was not chosen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it provides no guarantee of heat transfer efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or control efficiency. As with combustion devices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature deviations from the operating parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established during the most recent compliance test are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The monitoring requirements for flares are established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 40 CFR 60.18, which requires the owner or operator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor for the presence of a flame at all times.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The monitoring parameters for absorbers are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature and specific gravity of the scrubbing liquid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deviations from the operating parameters established during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent compliance test are limited to 11
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (20
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

Finally, in order to not prohibit the use of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control devices or new technology, a facility not using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device for which enhanced monitoring criteria have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been included may develop its own monitoring criteria and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit them to the Administrator for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also proposing alternative means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring compliance with the standards at terminals using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery devices for control of gasoline vapor emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These terminals would monitor the outlet concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC from the recovery device. Compliance with the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is indicated provided that the VOC concentration is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 ppmv or less. The EPA believes the 1,000 ppmv limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for gasoline vapor is generally more strict than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95-percent control device efficiency requirement. Data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an existing facility show this limit to be achievable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;B&hyph;13). The intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration alternative is to allow those facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate at a higher efficiency than required by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to perform a simpler compliance test, as they would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only have to test at the outlet of the control device. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not have sufficient data to determine a ppmv 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit for controlling VOC vapors from crude oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Nor does the EPA have sufficient data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine a ppmv emission limit for controlling HAP vapors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from crude oil emissions or other commodities. The EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting data and comments regarding a ppmv limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling non-gasoline VOC and HAP emissions and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorption would be used to control emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crude oil and other commodities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For enforcement purposes, it is necessary to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records and reports of various parameters at all facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two types of records would be required to ensure compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of facilities required to install controls: (1) Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results from the most recent performance test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) results from periods when the measurement of parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly deviated from measurements of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters during the most recent performance test. Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those periods when monitored parameters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly outside the specified range would be submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly. These reports are necessary to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control equipment is maintained in good operating condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, owners or operators would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keep vapor tightness documentation for marine vessels loaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on file in a permanent form available for inspection. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner or operator would be required to update the vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tightness documentation at least once per year to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that only vapor tight marine vessels are loaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators of affected facilities seeking to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance with the 93 percent emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction standard must maintain records of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of HAP control efficiency and must submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly reports of the source's HAP control efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated from their actual throughputs. The Agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting comment on these requirements. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency requests information on the type and method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that should be required to assure compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the 93 percent emission reduction standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Solicitation of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator specifically requests comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topics discussed in this section. Commenters should provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data and rationale to support their comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each topic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Subcategories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has proposed to establish a subcategory for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals emitting less than 1 Mg/yr of HAP. The Agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also requesting comment on whether off-shore terminals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Valdez Marine Terminal should be placed in separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategories under section 112 of the Act. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment regarding whether subcategories should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for other types of terminals based on particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of these types of terminals of which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency currently has no information. EPA also requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on whether further subcategorization based on size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Offshore terminals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a facility which is at least one-half mile offshore is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of a land-based contiguous site. Offshore terminals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(both those with subsea lines and platforms) that are part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a contiguous terminal (i.e., offshore terminals less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1/2 mile from shore) present unique regulatory challenges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as the cost and environmental impacts of installing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional subsea lines to carry vapors to land-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Size constraints, permitting difficulties, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other concerns may be issues with an offshore control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. The EPA is proposing that offshore terminals exceeding the throughput cutoffs and emission limits be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the proposed regulations and control vapors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same extent as onshore facilities. The EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting information and comments regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility and cost of controlling emissions from offshore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals. Comments are also requested on the grouping of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offshore facilities into a separate subcategory with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different control requirements under MACT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional subcategory for the valdez marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1993, the Alyeska Pipeline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service Company (``Alyeska'') sent a letter to the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding this proposed rule (see Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;D&hyph; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65). In the letter, Alyeska discussed an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory approach that would allow the use of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent controls at Alyeska's Alaska Valdez Marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Terminal (VMT). Alyeska ``believes that the optimal vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control system for the VMT is a system that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captures and recovers vapors from tanker loading, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than one that incinerates captured vapors.'' Alyeska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that it can successfully design a vapor recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system for the VMT but intuitively believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction that such a system can achieve will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the percentage emissions reduction achieved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly smaller systems and particularly those which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address emissions from refined petroleum products rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than crude oil. Alyeska also believes that a vapor recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system for the VMT is unlikely to meet today's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of a 95-percent emission reduction of VOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP for recovery devices under section 183(f) and section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112, respectively. In addition, Alyeska states that the VMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be placed in a separate category or subcategory under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d) because Alyeska believes the VMT is unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among U.S. marine terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alyeska has also suggested separately (see Docket A&hyph;90&hyph; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44, item II&hyph;D&hyph;71) that a recovery device may be available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VMT that could meet a HAP emission reduction requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaching 93 percent but that would likely not meet a VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction requirement above 70 percent. Alyeska suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that as it is located in an ozone attainment area in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extreme northern climate where formation of ozone is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical concern, a lesser VOC reduction requirement may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable under section 183(f). The proposed format for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Section 112 emission limit requires the VMT to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the crude emissions by 95 percent when using a recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device. The EPA requests comments on whether this format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be changed to allow for a 93-percent reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions for less efficient control technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA made no changes to the proposed standard in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to Alyeska's letter. However, the EPA is seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment on the issues addressed by Alyeska. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, Alyeska intends to provide the EPA with further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation supporting its position before the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment period. The EPA will consider this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in addition to currently available information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in deciding the final standard. Currently available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information which will be considered is described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 183(f) requires the application of RACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering ``costs, any non-air quality benefits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts, energy requirements and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors associated with alternative control techniques.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(d) requires the application of MACT considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.'' (In addition, as described previously, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum control level is specified, referred to as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(c) requires the EPA to establish categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and subcategories of sources for regulation under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112(d). In the EPA's notice of initial list of categories, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA stated that ``a category of sources is a group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources having some common features suggesting that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be regulated in the same way and on the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule.'' (57 FR 31578, July 16, 1992). The EPA also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted that ``criteria that may need to be considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defining categories of similar sources include similarities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in: process operations (including differences between batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and continuous operations), emissions characteristics, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device applicability and costs, safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities for pollution prevention'' (57 FR 31580). To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justify VMT being placed in a separate category or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategory, it needs to be shown that VMT has distinctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are relevant from a regulatory standpoint (given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions of section 112), in determining whether the VMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be regulated in a similar manner as other terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VMT is the largest crude oil loading facility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the U.S. with hourly crude loading rates more than 15 times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of any other marine terminal. The VMT is one of only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few terminals which are exclusively used for crude oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alyeska has acknowledged that it could use a combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device at VMT to achieve a 98 percent reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. However, Alyeska has raised concerns about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility of recovering crude oil vapors with a 95 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency using conventional recovery devices such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon adsorbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Alyeska the design and construction of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor recovery system for the VMT would be technically more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicated than for any other marine terminal. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because no existing vapor recovery system is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating on as large a vapor stream as the VMT terminal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is great complexity in recovering crude oil vapor (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to petroleum product vapor), and for reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in the following paragraph, a VMT recovery system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be designed to operate efficiently over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad range of declining input volumes. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sub-Arctic climate of the region presents unique problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to handling water vapor in terms of both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complications on the technical processes by which crude oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapors can be recovered and in terms of monitoring accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different and more complex operating parameters must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in the design and construction of a vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery system that will operate effectively on the VMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crude oil stream because the number and range of volatility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the hydrocarbon components are greater in a crude oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream than in a product stream. Alyeska believes that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be possible to achieve as high a recovery from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crude oil vapor stream as is achievable from a product vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream because of this difference in the number and range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatility of the hydrocarbon components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The throughput in the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline (TAP), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which supplies the crude for loading at the VMT, is expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to decline such that the volume of vapors that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled by the VMT recovery system will decrease with time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988 annual TAP throughput reached a peak of 2.14 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrels per day. Throughput subsequently has declined to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current level of 1.62 million barrels per day (average year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to date for 1993) and estimates indicate that production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to decline over the life of the now declining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Slope oil fields. An emission control system designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the VMT needs to be able to operate efficiently over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad range of declining input volumes. When considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declining throughput, a recovery system enables more design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility than an incineration system because recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems require enough contact with either surface area or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrubbing liquid to ensure high recovery; as flow decreases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact increases which marginally increases recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a facility may design very large control units or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller parallel units, both of which will function at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design efficiency. An incinerator is not as flexible in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation as a recovery system. An incinerator requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper mixing of the waste stream and the flame and mixing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes poorer as flow rates decline. Large incinerators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be run at flow rates much lower than one half design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates without affecting mixing and corresponding combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition the VMT will require the use of ``active'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detonation arrestors instead of ``passive'' detonation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrestors used at other marine terminals, due to the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of vapors that must be collected and the distance between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vessel loading berths and vapor recovery facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alyeska has developed active detonator arrestors that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been approved by the Coast Guard, because passive detonation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrestors would not protect a VMT type system from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explosion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alyeska estimated that the additional amount of energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could be conserved by recovering (instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerating) tanker vapors at the VMT would be as great or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than the energy that could be saved by recovering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanker vapors at all other U.S. crude oil loading marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals combined (about 250,000 barrels at current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughput). Both recovery and incineration result in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air pollutants including particulate matter (PM), sulfur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxides (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Vapor recovery may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantageous when considering the overall contribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all pollutants to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard does not treat a facility such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VMT as a separate category or subcategory. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is still considering whether these characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above are sufficient to warrant treatment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility like the VMT as a separate subcategory, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting additional information and public comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this issue. Comment is also requested on the extent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which these factors, largely related to recovery devices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered if such a facility can use an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerator. Additional information is sought on the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which factors such as a different detonator device are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to the decision. The EPA also invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alyeska's suggestion that a VOC reduction requirement less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than 95 percent is appropriate for a terminal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ozone attainment area in an extreme northern climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where ozone formation is not a practical concern. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will evaluate all information and comments submitted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making a final determination before promulgation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alyeska states that diminishing throughput could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate the need for control equipment at all berths in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the future; if throughput continues to decline, the VMT will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eventually be able to handle the entire throughput at only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two berths instead of the four available berths. Alyeska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has raised an issue concerning the need to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
berths normally not in use if they are used for ``emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes.'' The issue is independent of the choice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control systems and would not be considered in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether it is appropriate to put the VMT in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate subcategory. However, the EPA may evaluate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory approach which requires full control of emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the primary loading berths, but allows occasional use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontrolled berths. This type of regulatory scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that emissions from the uncontrolled berths would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negligible when compared to emissions to the controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
berths. For the EPA to evaluate such an approach requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VMT to provide detailed information on the impacts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tradeoffs for various scenarios of the controlled versus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncontrolled berths. The EPA is requesting comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of approach, including the need to limit frequency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use or mass emissions, and the details that should be in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to ensure compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If facilities with characteristics like the VMT were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate subcategory, the MACT floor would appear to be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. The EPA would consider requiring control levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more stringent than the MACT floor. The tradeoffs between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration and vapor recovery would be considered in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, and also in the determination of RACT under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 183(f). The declining throughput and its affect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of berths would also be considered in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alyeska is still studying the total impacts associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with vapor recovery systems. Currently, Alyeska has not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided the EPA with the control efficiency of the recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, the energy requirements, costs, or the secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants associated with recovery; nor has Alyeska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided evidence showing that a 93 or 95 percent reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in emissions of HAP using a recovery device is infeasible at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VMT. Moreover, given that the EPA's definition of VOC does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include methane and ethane, there is some question as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a 95 percent reduction in VOC is in fact possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using recovery at the VMT. Additional information is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed on the declining throughput, its effect on the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of berths controlled, and the tradeoffs involved. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could possibly consider the trade-offs among HAP, VOC, PM,

 in addition to energy savings when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating recovery versus incineration. The EPA invites

comment on whether a regulatory approach that would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of a less stringent vapor recovery system at the VMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is permissible and appropriate under the Act. Such comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include the consideration of tradeoffs between HAP, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other pollutants, energy, and whether consideration of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tradeoffs is permissible under sections 112 and 183(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before promulgating a final rule, the EPA will evaluate all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information, data, and comments submitted. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this evaluation, the promulgated standards could be set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the proposed RACT and MACT levels, but the EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examine all information relevant to including a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategory for large crude terminals and establishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different MACT level for each subcategory.

2. Ballasting Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing today's proposed rule the Agency has assumed that the prohibition of ballasting emissions does not contain
any impacts for industry because of the U.S. Coast Guard regulations requiring segregated ballasting tanks. The
Administrator is soliciting comments and data that might indicate that there are potential impacts to certain classes
of vessels, particularly those carrying noncrude oil product. In addition, the Administrator encourages comment
on how a prohibition of ballasting emissions could be implemented most effectively.

3. Alternative Concentration-Based Compliance Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For terminals that use recovery devices for control of gasoline VOC and/or HAP emissions, the EPA is proposing an alternative
means of compliance to the proposed standards. The EPA is soliciting data and comments regarding a ppmv limit for controlling
non-gasoline VOC and HAP emissions and whether carbon adsorption would be used to control emissions from crude oil
and other commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Vessel Tightness Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards require vessels to undergo one of three tightness tests at least every 12 months. The Administrator
is soliciting data on the frequency of leaks on marine vessels to determine whether the interval between tests is appropriate.
The Administrator is also requesting data on the effectiveness of requiring vessels to undergo one of these three
tightness tests.

5. Procedures to Estimate HAP Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TSD describes the limited data regarding marine vessel loading emission factors available to the Administrator
to use in estimating HAP (or VOC) emissions from marine vessel loading operations. While these data are sufficient
to estimate emissions as part of regulatory impact analyses, they may not be sufficient for the Administrator to require
the use of specific emission factors in the emission estimation alternative allowed under the proposed part 63 standards
for existing sources. For this reason, facilities wanting to take advantage of this alternative will develop and
submit documentation of emission estimates on a case-by-case basis. The Administrator requests that commenters
submit data on possible emission factors and/or alternative emission estimation procedures for consideration
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. RACT Standard of 93 Percent Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, for those sources regulated under section 183(f) of the Act, the EPA is requiring that such sources
reduce emissions at their facility overall by 95 percent if using a recovery device or by 98 percent if using a destruction
device. Nevertheless, the Agency specifically decided not to increase the stringency of its MACT standard, for those
existing sources regulated under section 112, beyond a reduction level of 93 percent because the cost effectiveness
level of such an increase would not be reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that it is reasonable, given the associated cost effectiveness values, to require the facilities
regulated under section 183(f) (the largest terminals of their kind in the U.S.) to reduce emissions by 95 or 98 percent,
despite the fact that the Agency is requiring only 93 percent reduction for the terminals regulated under section
112. However, the EPA understands that it is unusual for a RACT standard for any single source to be more stringent than
a MACT standard for that source, as it may be for certain sources regulated under both sections 112 and 183(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on whether the analysis performed for regulation of sources under the MACT standard of
section 112 is equally valid under the RACT standard of section 183(f). That is, given the cost effectiveness values
associated with decreasing the stringency of the RACT standard from 95 or 98 percent control to 93 percent control,
would it be reasonable, ``considering costs, any nonair-quality benefits, environmental impacts, energy requirements
and safety factors,'' for the Agency to promulgate a standard of 93 percent control for those sources regulated under
section 183(f), in addition to those sources regulated solely under section 112?

7. Carbon Bed Regeneration Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed regulation, the Agency is prohibiting HAP emissions from the regeneration of a carbon bed when a carbon
bed adsorber is used to control HAP emissions. The Agency is requesting comment on this requirement.

8. MACT Floor Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a March 9, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice reopening the public comment period for determination of ``MACT floor'' for NESHAP source categories (59
FR 11018), the Agency considered more than one interpretation of the statutory language concerning the MACT floor
for existing sources and solicited comment on them. The MACT floor decision that the EPA will make on the basis of this
March 9, 1994, notice will have broad precedential effects, and will presumptively be followed by the Agency in any
rulemakings subsequently promulgated under Title III of the Act. The MACT floor determinations proposed in today's
rulemaking may therefore be affected by the Agency's final interpretation of ``MACT floor.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 112(d)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act require that the EPA set standards no less stringent than ``the average emission
limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources'' if there are at least 30 sources in
a category, or ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources'' if there are fewer than
30 sources in a category. During the development of this proposed rule, the EPA considered two interpretations of
this statutory language. One interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation achieved by'' together
in a single phrase and asks what is the ``average emission limitation achieved by'' the best performing 12 percent.
This interpretation places the emphasis on ``average.'' It would correspond to first identifying the best performing
12 percent of the existing sources, then determining the average emission limitation achieved by these sources as
a group. Another interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation'' into a single phrase and asks what
``average emission limitation'' is ``achieved by'' all members of the best performing 12 percent. In this case, the
``average emission limitation'' might be interpreted as the average reduction across the HAP emitted by an emission
point over time. Under this interpretation, the EPA would look at the average emission limits achieved by each of the
best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and take the lowest. This interpretation would correspond to the
level of control achieved by the source at the 88th percentile if all sources were ranked from the most controlled (100th
percentile) to the least controlled (1st percentile). For today's proposed regulation, the Administrator is using
the first interpretation described above, which interprets the statutory language to mean that the MACT floor for
existing sources should be set at the level of control achieved by the ``average'' of the best performing 12 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing the MACT floor for today's proposed regulations, the EPA also considered two possible meanings for
the word ``average'' as the term is used in section 112(d)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act. First, the EPA considered interpreting
``average'' as the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided
by the number of measurements in the set. The EPA determined that the arithmetic mean of the emissions limitations
achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources in some cases would yield an emission limitation that
fails to correspond to the limitation achieved by any particular technology. In cases where this limitation existed,
the EPA decided not to select this approach. The EPA also considered interpreting ``average'' as the median emission
limitation value. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of
values (when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the subcategory of sources emitting 1 Mg/yr or more of HAP, the Agency determined that the derived arithmetic mean,
for all practical purposes, is equivalent to recovery technologies and thus the Agency used the mean to determine
the MACT floor for this subcategory. The EPA selected the median for the subcategory of sources emitting less than
1 Mg/yr of HAP because the arithmetic mean yields a value that does not correspond to a particular emission control
technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA solicits comment on its interpretation of ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing
12 percent of the existing sources'' (section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Act) and its methodology for determining the MACT
floor.

standard. The baseline temperature is averaged over the

loading cycle. The Agency believes that it is appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to average temperatures measured during the compliance test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish a baseline temperature to which monitored data

The information collection requirements in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standard have been submitted for approval to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA (ICR No. 1679.01), and interested parties may obtain a

copy from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401 M Street, SW. (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public reporting burden for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this collection of information is estimated to average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
265 hours per respondent per year, including time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economy, a section of the economy, productivity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' because an annual effect on the economy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 million or more is anticipated. As such, this action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public record.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 19, 1980) requires consideration of the impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on small entities, which are small businesses, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small organizations, and small governments. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of this Act is to ensure consideration of regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives that might mitigate adverse economic impacts on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities. If a preliminary analysis indicates that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation is likely to have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory flexibility analysis must be performed to examine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives that might lessen such effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT determination considered for this regulation, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a preliminary assessment of the potential adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts on small entities. Two types of businesses were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified that could incur adverse small business impacts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine terminal operations and marine vessel operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to marine terminal operations, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards exempt facilities with HAP emissions of less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 Mg/yr. This reduces the number of impacted terminals from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 1,450 to 264. These exemptions allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smallest operations to avoid installation of controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These exemptions greatly reduce per-barrel control cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentials that, as indicated in the economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, would make it difficult for owners of the smallest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminals to pass forward control costs to consumers had no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or fewer exemptions been made. With the proposed standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, it is expected that a large portion (up to 200) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 264 regulated terminals will only be able to pass a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraction of the control costs on to consumers in the form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher prices. This condition is attributable to the EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption that loading costs will increase by the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of control, that terminals are competitive and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than average control cost terminals will have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorb those differences. Thus, the economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these terminal owners is expected to be significant because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the impact of cost absorption on profitability and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulty in raising capital for the control system. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other hand, of those 200 terminals, it is expected that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many are part of large integrated petroleum operations, have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easier access to capital and will remain open. Some with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than average control costs will also be in a position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to raise their prices as much as their control costs because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of favorable locations or other market conditions. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the overall number of small business terminal operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly affected by this regulation is expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to marine vessel operations, the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis considered all of these operations to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses. The number of vessel operations estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be impacted by the proposed standards is expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial since a significant percentage of the petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products transported via marine vessels will be affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards. Excluding volume from the three large crude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil terminals affected (these terminals are served by large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil tankers with insignificant estimated retrofit costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
($0.002/bbl), 77 percent of the U.S. marine transported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughput of controlled products and crude oil will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the standards. That same volume percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fleet marine vessels will need to be retrofitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service regulated terminals. It is expected, however, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many of these vessel owners will be able to pass forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofit costs in the form of higher transport prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has therefore judged that a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(namely terminals) will likely result from the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and that a regulatory flexibility analysis should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be performed.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lake Erie water snake is found on the islands of western Lake Erie and the adjacent mainland of Ohio and Ontario,
Canada. It has been proposed for listing as a threatened species due to strong evidence that its numbers have declined
dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat and human persecution, and that the threats
to the habitat and to the snakes themselves are continuing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice announcing the proposing of the Lake Erie water snake for classification as a threatened species was published
on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43857). The original comment period ended on November 16, and the deadline for receipt of public
hearing requests was October 4. On October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52740), a second notice was published extending the comment
period until November 16, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 5, 1993, the Service received a request for a public hearing on this proposal from Donald J. McTigue, representing
Baycliff's Corporation. A second request for a public hearing was received by the Service on October 13, 1993, from
H. R. Clagg, President of the Johnson's Island Property Owners' Association. The Service has scheduled two hearings
in the area potentially affected by the listing proposal. Those parties wishing to make statements for the record
should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the hearing. Oral statements may
be limited to 5 or 10 minutes, if the number of parties present necessitates some limitation. There are no limits to
the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. Oral and written comments receive
equal consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may now
be submitted until June 16, 1994, to the Service office in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS is required to publish an estimate of the number of seals expected to be harvested in the current year to meet the
subsistence needs of the Aleut residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK, pursuant to the regulations governing the subsistence
taking of northern fur seals. The purpose of these regulations is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing
for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management
purposes. This notice estimates the number of seals to be taken in 1994. This notice also proposes to amend existing
fur seal regulations, making the harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year. This proposed amendment
is based on the fact that a relatively consistent number of fur seals has been harvested each year since 1989, and that
NMFS does not expect subsistence needs to increase such that takes for subsistence purposes will exceed the established
upper limit of the subsistence harvest estimate range first established for the 1992 harvest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Callorhinus ursinus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, on the Pribilof Islands, AK, is governed by regulations found in 50 CFR part 215, subpart D_Taking for Subsistence
Purposes. The purpose of these regulations, published under the authority of the Fur Seal Act (FSA), 16 U.S.C. 1151

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents and to restrict
taking by sex, age, and season for herd management purposes. To minimize negative effects on the Pribilof Islands
fur seal population, the harvest has been limited to a 47-day season (June 23&hyph;August 8) and is restricted to only
subadult male fur seals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes, NMFS must publish a summary
of the previous year's fur seal harvest (1993 harvest results were published on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 59297)), and
a projection of the number of seals expected to be taken in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut
residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected estimates are given as a range, the lower end of which may be exceeded if NMFS is given notice, and the Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), determines that the annual subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts have
not been satisfied (50 CFR 215.32(e)(3)). Conversely, the harvest can be terminated before the lower end of the range
is reached if it is determined that the annual subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents have been met or the harvest
has been conducted in a wasteful manner.

Subsistence Estimates and Trends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of northern fur seals harvested on St. Paul Island since 1986 has ranged from 1,077 (1990) to 1,710 (1987)
(Table 1). The annual subsistence takes on St. George Island since 1986 have ranged from 92 (1987) to 319 (1993) seals
(Table 1). Within the past 3 years, however, the number of fur seals harvested annually has been relatively consistent.
Since 1991, the average number of seals harvested each year on St. Paul and St. George Islands has been 1,548 (range:
1,482&hyph;1,645) and 265 (range: 194&hyph;319), respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the actual number of animals
harvested has never reached the upper end of the estimated range. In 1992, for example, only 194 of the 365 fur seals
originally estimated for subsistence need during that year were taken on St. George Island. In 1993, only 319 of the
407 seals requested were taken to meet the subsistence needs of St. George residents.

Estimate of Subsistence Need for 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has used the previous year's harvest levels as a baseline to estimate need in the current year. Household surveys
have also been conducted by the tribal government on each island since 1992 to estimate, in part, the number of seals
required to meet the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Islands residents (57 FR 22450, May 25, 1992, and 58 FR 32892,
June 14, 1993). However, not all households can be assessed during a survey. Therefore, results of these surveys provide
an index of need rather than an absolute estimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS requested that the tribal government on each island determine the number of fur seals that each household would
need for the coming year on January 13, 1994. This year's results were consistent with past subsistence harvest survey
requests and take records. Therefore, NMFS proposes that the same estimate ranges be established for 1994 as were
established for 1992 and 1993: 281&hyph;500 fur seals for St. George Island and 1,645 to 2,000 for St. Paul Island.
NMFS' biologists will continue to monitor the entire harvest on St. George and St. Paul Islands to ensure that the harvest
is carried out in a manner that fully complies with the regulations specified at 50 CFR 215.32. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described earlier in this notice, if the Aleut residents of either island reach the lower end of this yearly harvest
estimate and have unmet subsistence needs and no indication of waste, they may request an additional number of seals
up to the upper limit of the respective harvest estimates. The residents of St. George Island and St. Paul Island may
substantiate any additional need for seals by submitting in writing the information upon which they base their decision
that subsistence needs are unfulfilled. The regulations at 50 CFR 215.32(e)(1)(iii) require a suspension of the
fur seal harvest for up to 48 hours once the lower end of the estimated harvest levels is reached. The suspension is to
last no more than 48 hours, followed either by a finding that the subsistence needs have been met or by a revised estimate
of the number of seals necessary to satisfy the Aleuts' subsistence needs.

Proposed Modification to Fur Seal Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a notice published on August 1, 1991, NMFS acknowledged the need to develop other methods to monitor the subsistence
harvest conducted on the Pribilof Islands (56 FR 36735). In a workshop conducted by NMFS on November 5, 1991, NMFS recognized
the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence, to determine whether changes in the fur seal
harvest from a commercial endeavor to one for subsistence may have warranted a revision of the current management
regime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a first step towards addressing these concerns, NMFS proposes an amendment to &sect;215.32 of the FSA regulations,
allowing subsistence take estimates to be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. During this 3-year period,
NMFS will examine the current subsistence harvest management regime. The proposed amendment is based on the fact
that the actual number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent (Table 1), and the
fur seal take has never exceeded the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest.
Due to recent commercial development in the Pribilof Islands, NMFS anticipates that the subsistence needs will increase
during the next 3 years, but, based on historical evidence to date, the annual subsistence needs are not expected to
increase to levels exceeding the range established in the 1993 final estimate.

NMFS has determined that the approval and implementation of this proposed rule will not significantly affect the
human environment, and that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on this is not required by section 102(2)
of the National Environmental Policy Act or its implementing regulations. This rule makes only minor changes to the
regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes; this action does not entail significant
substantive revision. Because this rule does not alter the conclusions of previous environmental impact analyses
and environmental assessments, it is categorically excluded by NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6 from the requirement
to prepare an environmental assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant pursuant to E.O. 12866.

The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The only impact will be on individual native Alaskan residents of the Pribilof Islands due to revision of the schedule
for estimating fur seal harvest levels from an annual estimate to an estimate applicable to a 3-year period. Therefore,
a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement a revised part of Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management
Plan (FMP) for the winter flounder fishery (revised winter flounder exemption) that was initially disapproved on
September 30, 1993. The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) has revised a provision that would exempt
fishermen from some regulations for the winter flounder fishery, under certain conditions, if they are fishing only
in state waters. The intended effect is to ensure adequate protection for winter flounder stocks, while minimizing
the regulatory burden on fishermen.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Council submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 27, 1993. Two measures in the amendment were disapproved on September 30, 1993_a haddock possession limit,
and the provisions for winter flounder fishing in state waters. The remainder of Amendment 5 was approved on January
3, 1994. Pursuant to section 304(b)(3)(A) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act),
the Council has submitted the revised winter flounder exemption as described in this proposed rule. The Council's
submission of a revised haddock possession limit is not contained in this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disapproved measure for winter flounder established an exemption to the minimum mesh size and minimum fish size
regulations when fishing for winter flounder in state waters, provided that a given state's regulations conformed
with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (ASMFC) Winter Flounder Plan (ASMFC Plan). The original
submission for winter flounder was disapproved because this provision was added to Amendment 5 without adequate
analysis, was poorly defined, and would likely have increased mortality of winter flounder and other multispecies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised winter flounder exemption, as described in this proposed rule, lists a detailed set of criteria under
which a vessel holding a Federal Northeast multispecies permit may fish for winter flounder with mesh smaller than
the minimum mesh requirement in the FMP, and retain winter flounder smaller than the minimum fish size for that species
in the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Federal regulations for winter flounder apply to all federally permitted vessels whether they are fishing
in state waters or Federal waters. When a federally permitted vessel is fishing for winter flounder in state waters,
the more restrictive of either the state or Federal regulations applies. Thus, even if an overall state management
program is more restrictive, an individual Federal regulation, such as a minimum mesh size, applies if it is more restrictive
than the individual state regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulations implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994), increased the minimum mesh size for fishing for any of the regulated multispecies finfish,
including winter flounder, and applied it throughout the range of the species. Prior to Amendment 5, the minimum mesh
size was 51/2 inches (13.97 cm) in the Gulf of Maine, on Georges Bank, and a part of Southern New England, while elsewhere
there was no minimum net mesh size. Under Amendment 5, the minimum mesh size requirement is 6 inches (15.24 cm) throughout
the net in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank, as of May 1, 1994. The minimum mesh size requirement is 51/2 inches (13.97
cm) throughout the net in Southern New England in 1994, remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51/2 inch (13.97 cm) diamond and increasing to 6-inch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15.24 cm) square in 1995, and thereafter. In the mid-Atlantic, the minimum mesh size requirement is 51/2 inches (13.97
cm) as described in the summer flounder regulations under 50 CFR 625.24(a). Also under the amendment, the minimum
size for winter flounder was increased from 11 inches (27.9 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASMFC Plan was approved in May, 1992. The fishing mortality objectives of the ASMFC Plan, a maximum spawning potential
(MSP) target of 30 percent by January 1, 1995, and an MSP target of 40 percent by January 1, 1999, are more restrictive
than in the FMP for federally managed stocks (20 percent MSP). The ASMFC Plan allows individual states to utilize different
measures to achieve these objectives. State plans must be reviewed by the ASMFC's Winter Flounder Technical Committee
and approved by the ASMFC Winter Flounder Management Board as meeting the management objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council proposes the winter flounder exemption on the basis that, while the management objectives of the ASMFC
Plan are more conservative for winter flounder than those of Amendment 5, they may be achieved by a different set of
measures than those in the FMP. Without the proposed exemption, a vessel would have to comply with the more restrictive
elements of both the state and Federal regulations. Under these circumstances, compliance with both state and Federal
rules simultaneously might impose an unnecessary regulatory burden on federally permitted vessels fishing in state
waters for winter flounder that exceeds that which applies to either state-permitted vessels fishing exclusively
in state waters or federally permitted vessels fishing in Federal waters. The purpose of the proposed action is to
alleviate the cumulative impact of the regulations on fishermen, while still achieving the FMP's objectives for
winter flounder and other regulated species of the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provides that a vessel holding a Federal multispecies permit may fish for winter flounder with mesh
smaller than that specified in the regulations governing the multispecies fishery (50 CFR part 651), may retain winter
flounder smaller than the minimum size allowed by those regulations, and may retain more than the possession limit
of winter flounder, if certain conditions are met. These conditions are: (1) The fishing is conducted exclusively
in the waters of the state from which the exemption certificate was obtained; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the vessel has on board a certificate issued by the state agency authorizing the vessel's participation in the
state's winter flounder fishing program and is in compliance with the applicable state laws pertaining to minimum
mesh size and minimum fish size for winter flounder; (3) the state's winter flounder plan has been approved by the ASMFC
as being in compliance with the ASMFC Plan; (4) the state elects in writing to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS
(Regional Director), to participate in the exemption program; (5) the amount of regulated species, exclusive of
winter flounder, on board a vessel issued a limited access permit that is fishing under the days-at-sea (DAS) program
or under a DAS exemption program in &sect;651.22(d), does not exceed the possession limit; (6) the vessel does not
enter or transit the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), unless the vessel is in a designated transit zone established
by the Regional Director at the request of the coastal state; and (7) the vessel does not enter or transit the waters
of another state, unless such other state is participating in the exemption program described by this section and
the vessel is enrolled in that state's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption to Federal fishery regulations being proposed in this action would apply to minimum fish lengths, minimum
mesh size, and the regulated species possession limit of winter flounder, in certain cases. A vessel must still comply
with all other applicable Federal fisheries regulations while fishing for winter flounder under this exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this revised version of the winter flounder exemption is to achieve conservation objectives under the
FMP and the ASMFC Plan for winter flounder, and to meet conservation objectives under the FMP for other regulated species
of groundfish as defined in the FMP, while still providing for the winter flounder exemption in state waters. The Council
intends that any vessel holding a Federal multispecies permit under the FMP subject to requirements of the DAS program
in the FMP will have its fishing activity in state waters for winter flounder credited towards its individual DAS or
fleet DAS. This requirement should minimize the effect of fishing for winter flounder in state waters on other regulated
species of groundfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessels fishing in state waters under the winter flounder exemption program would be subject to possession limits
that would vary, depending on the vessel's gear type and the category of the Federal multispecies permit it holds.
Vessels fishing with gillnets, vessels less than 45 ft (13.7 m) in length, and vessels under the individual or fleet
DAS program may harvest an unlimited amount of winter flounder and not more than 500 lbs (226.8 kg) of the remaining
regulated species other than winter flounder. Vessels using hook gear still would not be subject to any possession
limits on multispecies. Vessels fishing with a possession limit only permit would be subject to the 500-lb (226.8-kg)
possession limit for regulated species.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this action
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action proposed by this rule will
provide an undetermined amount of regulatory relief to affected fishing vessels, all of which are small entities.
It is unknown how many vessels will choose to fish exclusively in state waters on a given trip if this rule is implemented.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing revisions in subpart C (Child Labor Reg. No. 3) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an exception from the permissible hours and time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for minors 14 and 15 years of age when employed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendants in professional sports. The proposed exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits such employment to outside school hours and to duties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customarily performed by typical sports attendants (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batboys/girls, ballboys/girls, etc.). Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications are proposed in the procedure for obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational variations for 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work Experience and Career Exploration Programs. Among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other revisions to update these regulations, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also proposing to delete the procedures relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous occupation determinations in Subpart D (Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor Reg. 5), which, for the most part, have been replaced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedure Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (FLSA) establish a minimum age of 14 years for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment in most nonagricultural occupations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide by regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 years of age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and during periods and under conditions which will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with their schooling or with their health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-being. These provisions also permit 16- and 17-year- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
old minors to be employed in the nonagricultural sector, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without hours or time limitations, subject to prohibitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on occupations found and declared by the Secretary of Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be particularly hazardous, or detrimental to the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or well-being of minors under age 18. In agriculture, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minors 14 and older may be engaged in general employment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to prohibitions on occupations declared particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. Additionally, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agriculture 12- and 13-year-olds may be employed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written parental consent or on a farm where the minor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parent is also employed. Under very limited waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, 10- and 11-year-olds may be employed outside of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school hours in agriculture as hand harvesters of short 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season crops for a maximum annual period of eight weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations for 14-and 15-year-olds are known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart C of 29 CFR Part 570. Reg. 3, as amended, limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Outside school hours; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not in session; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Not more than 18 hours in any one week when school

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; except during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summer (June 1 through Labor Day) when the evening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour is extended to 9 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summer school sessions are considered to be ``outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school hours,'' i.e., nonschool weeks. Also, 14- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15-year-olds enrolled in a State-approved, school-supervised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks, 3 hours on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school days, and during school hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Child Labor Reg. 3 permits work by 14- and 15-year-olds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service establishments, and prohibits their employment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain other work, including work prohibited by hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing an exception from the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permissible hours and time standards for 14- and 15-year-olds employed as attendants in professional sports. The

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department suspended enforcement of the child labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as applied to batboys/girls employed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional baseball during the 1993 baseball season, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently extended the policy to attendants in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional sports while reviewing such employment under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the child labor regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During 1986 and 1987, the Department conducted a study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the request of the Congress
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to determine whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the permissible hours of employment for batboys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and batgirls would be detrimental to their well-being and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether any changes to existing standards should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed. The Department concluded that changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permissible hours and time standards for batboy/girl work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be detrimental to their health and well-being. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department surveyed 157 professional league baseball 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teams and conducted selected on-site interviews with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents, teachers, team owners, and batboys/girls and found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that youths genuinely enjoyed the experience. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department could find no evidence that school grades were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affected by such work. The Department also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advised the Congress that regulatory modifications, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than legislative change, would be the best vehicle to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the matter of permissible hours for batboys/girls.

The Department's Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in 1987 to provide advice and guidance in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of possible proposals to change existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, recommended that existing hours and time of work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards be retained for 14- and 15-year-olds employed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sports attendants, including batboys/girls; and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work performed in such activity be limited to traditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duties, i.e., putting out and taking in field equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
running errands for players, and supplying the umpire with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balls. While the Committee's advisory view was taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration, the Department also continued to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other pertinent information, including inquiries received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from interested parties concerning the employment of youth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in sports-related activities, such as scorekeepers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concession stand helpers, ball monitors and sideline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials. One inquiry concerned conforming the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child labor regulations to a State of Wisconsin provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which permits youths under age 14 to be employed by high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools as ball monitors and sideline officials at football 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
games. Another was received from the Grant County (Kansas) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recreation Commission concerning 14- and 15-year-olds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed as scorekeepers and concession stand helpers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summer softball, baseball, and other sports programs. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inc. (NAPBL) petitioned
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 the Department in June 1993 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revise the regulation to permit the employment of 14- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15-year-olds as batboys for professional baseball clubs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the NAPBL, existing hours and time-of-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards effectively preclude baseball teams from lawfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employing youth under the age of 16. The NAPBL contended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further that such employment is not adverse to the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and well-being of youth and that the denial of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batboy/girl experience is inconsistent with the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FLSA's child labor provisions.

Section 570.38 of the regulations provides that persons desiring revisions of subpart C of part 570 may submit in writing
to the Secretary of Labor a petition setting forth the changes desired and the reasons for proposing them. In response,
the Secretary may either schedule hearings or make other provision for affording interested parties an opportunity
to be heard.

Some employers are covered by all of FLSA's provisions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while others are covered by the FLSA but may be exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its minimum wage and overtime provisions though not its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child labor provisions.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Other employers that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the FLSA are subject to varying State child labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The practice of providing sport-attendant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences to America's youth is a longstanding tradition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a consequence, many professional and semi-professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sports teams, i.e., baseball, basketball, etc., have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violated Federal child labor regulations by employing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underage youth, particularly 14- and 15-year-olds, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sports-attendants.

For example, section 13(a)(3) of the FLSA exempts any employee employed by an amusement or recreational establishment
from the minimum wage (section 6) and overtime (section 7) provisions of the Act, but not from the child labor provisions
(section 12), if the establishment does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year, or if during the
preceding calendar year the establishment's average receipts for any six months were not more than 331/2 percent
of its average receipts for the other six months.

The Department believes that a change in the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal hours and times standards to allow employment of 14- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 15-year-olds as batboys/girls, ballboys/girls, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other sports-attendant capacities would not be inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FLSA's oppressive child labor provisions and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, proposes a narrow exception from the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Child Labor Reg. 3 for such work. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed exception is limited to employment by professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sports organizations and would apply only if the duties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed are traditional in nature and the work is outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular school hours. Thus, the current restrictions when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school is in session, i.e, 3-hour daily limit, 18-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekly limit, and 7 p.m. end-of-day time restriction, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current 9 p.m. end-of-day time restriction when school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in not in session would not apply to 14- and 15-year-old 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sports-attendants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that a delicate balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists between the value of jobs that provide positive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formative experiences, and the possible negative effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that excessive employment of youth can have on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic performance and their health and well-being. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that the proposed change for 14- and 15-year-olds in sports attending activities will not have
an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effect on their health, well-being, or educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development. Further, the Department believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided herein is consistent with the purpose of the FLSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to permit safe and healthy employment opportunities under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions which protect the health, well-being, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schooling of such young workers. See 29 U.S.C. 203(l). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department proposes to delete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 29 CFR part 570, subpart D (Child Labor Reg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5). These regulations provide a procedure for the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promulgate or amend hazardous occupation orders (HOs), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which identify occupations in which employment of minors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 18 years of age is prohibited because the Secretary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 3(l) of the Act, has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupations are particularly hazardous for such workers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detrimental to their health or well-being. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to repeal Child Labor Reg. 5, because its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural requirements are no longer necessary, and because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued existence of the regulation poses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for confusion regarding the process to be utilized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary in the review, amendment, and promulgation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of HOs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Child Labor Reg. 5 was promulgated in 1938, immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the enactment of the FLSA (3 FR 2640 (1938)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although neither the FLSA nor other laws required such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, the Children's Bureau, which at that time was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged with administration of the FLSA child labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, prescribed the process so that the public would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be informed of the Department's intentions regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creation or amendment of restrictions on the employment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minors in hazardous occupations. The original Child Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reg. 5 identified certain mandatory steps, including public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings, to be taken in HO promulgation. The Congress, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, imposed a standardized procedure in 1946 for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agencies to follow when issuing or amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The procedures in this law, the Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedure Act (APA), 60 Stat. 237, provide greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative flexibility than the process in Child Labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reg. 5, in that, for example, the APA does not mandate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing in every case prior to promulgation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. There have been no changes to Child Labor Reg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 except for a technical amendment in 1961 (26 FR 5005 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1961)) to more align the HO process with APA requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., hearings were identified among various optional steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Department could utilize.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Department's view that Child Labor Reg. 5 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer necessary. The procedures set out in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation are not substantively different from the APA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements which control DOL rulemaking, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of HOs. While the optional steps identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation are matters which the Department may choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to undertake in the promulgation of particular HOs, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps_involving study, drafting, examination, and review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of options and standards_are integral parts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's deliberative, policy-making process and, thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they need not and should not be set out in detail in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Further, it is the Department's view that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation potentially creates confusion in that the Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor Reg. 5 procedures may be viewed incorrectly as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory steps for promulgation of HOs. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeal of Child Labor Reg. 5 will eliminate the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also proposing a technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification in the regulations that is considered necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and appropriate in connection with the Work Experience and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Career Exploration Program (WECEP) to facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for certification under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 570.35a of the regulations provides for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in a State-approved, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school-supervised Work Experience and Career Exploration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program (WECEP).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 A condition for approval of such programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is that they provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employment will not interfere with the schooling of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minors or with their health and well-being. Enrollees in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved WECEPs may be employed for up to 23 hours in school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks, 3 hours on school days, and during school hours, in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for variances from the Reg. 3 occupations restrictions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those programs pursuant to &sect;570.35a(c)(3), the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has consistently approved variances for particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities which, within the operation of programs that meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the WECEP criteria, have been determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department not to interfere with the health and well-being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in the programs. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide pertinent guidance to the State Educational Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other interested parties, the Department proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend the WECEP regulations to specify that the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities will be ordinarily considered to be acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participants in approved WECEP programs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Using a deep fryer or cooking at a grill with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum temperature of 375 degrees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operating power-driven mowers, weed-eaters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimmers and whips with nylon string only; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Retrieving and/or placing food in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coolers/freezers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Loading and unloading goods weighing up to 30 lbs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that such work does not exceed 30 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the minor's weekly hours worked; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) Operating noncommercial dishwashers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In effect, the revised WECEP regulations would contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited exception to the Reg. 3 occupations restrictions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WECEP participants engaged in the specified activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in order to preserve the Department's discretion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify the Reg. 3 restrictions in special circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where a WECEP program applicant can demonstrate that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program will provide safe and suitable employment, the WECEP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation will continue to contain a provision for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining variances from occupational restrictions similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to variance procedures under other programs administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's Wage and Hour Division, e.g., see &sect;5.14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 29 CFR part 5 (Davis-Bacon and Related Acts) and &sect;4.123 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 29 CFR part 4 (McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department is proposing to delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exception contained in &sect;570.35(b) for enrollees in work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs conducted under the Economic Opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1964. This Act has been repealed and the exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no longer appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that this proposed rule is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866. It proposes to change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permissible hours and time standards to permit greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional sports attendants. While the changes proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expected to enhance opportunities for employment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on overall employment levels of 14- and 15-year-olds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is modest. Other proposed changes are technical in nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are expected to have only a minor impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds. Accordingly, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes are not expected to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no regulatory impact analysis has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. The proposed change to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception from the permissible hours and time standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minors 14 and 15 years of age when employed as attendants in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional sports has narrow application and will affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only a limited number of employers of which some may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered small entities. Although the other technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes may affect small entities, the impact is believed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be insignificant. For these reasons, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the proposed rule will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Labor has certified to this effect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis is required.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is considering proposing revisions in the child labor regulations issued
pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 CFR part 570, which set forth the criteria for the permissible employment
of minors under 18 years of age. In particular, subparts C and E of these regulations are under review. Subpart C (Child
Labor Reg. 3) specifies permissible hours and time standards, as well as occupational limitations, for 14- and 15-year-old
employees. Subpart E identifies occupations deemed particularly hazardous for, or detrimental to the health or
well-being of, employees under 18 years of age. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeks the views of the public
on needed changes to these regulations, and also with respect to other aspects of the regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establish a minimum age of 14 years for employment
in most nonagricultural occupations. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide by regulation for the employment
of young workers 14 and 15 years of age in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods
and under conditions which will not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being. These provisions
also permit 16- and 17-year-old minors to be employed in the nonagricultural sector, without hours or time limitations,
subject to prohibitions in occupations found and declared by the Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous,
or detrimental to the health or well-being of minors under age 18. In agriculture, minors 14 and older may be engaged
in general employment, subject to prohibitions on occupations declared particularly hazardous by the Secretary
of Labor. Additionally, in agriculture 12- and 13-year-olds may be employed with written parental consent or on a
farm where the minor's parent is also employed. Under very limited waiver conditions, 10- and 11-year-olds may be
employed outside of school hours in agriculture as hand harvesters of short season crops for a maximum annual period
of eight weeks.

The regulations for 14- and 15-year olds are known as Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are contained in subpart
C of 29 CFR part 570. Reg. 3, as amended, limits the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Outside school hours; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Not more than 40 hours in any one week when school is not in session; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Not more than 18 hours in any one week when school is in session; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(6) between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except during the summer (June 1 through Labor Day) when the evening hour is extended to
9 p.m.

Summer school sessions are considered to be ``outside school hours,'' i.e., nonschool weeks. Also, 14- and 15-year-olds
enrolled in a State-approved, school-supervised Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may be
employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks, 3 hours on school days, and during school hours.

Child Labor Reg. 3 permits work by 14- and 15-year-olds in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline
service establishments, and prohibits their employment in certain other work, including work prohibited by hazardous
occupational orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the FLSA child labor provisions, the Secretary has issued standards governing employment of minors under
18 years of age in nonagriculture occupations. The 17 nonagricultural hazardous occupations orders (HOs) now in
effect are contained in 29 CFR part 570, subpart E. Prohibitions established by these HOs apply either on an industry
basis, specifying the occupations in the industry that are not covered, or on an occupational basis irrespective
of the industry in which performed. The current nonagricultural HOs deal with manufacturing and storing explosives
(HO 1); motor-vehicle driving and outside helper (HO 2); coal mining (HO 3); logging and sawmilling (HO 4); power-driven
woodworking machines (HO 5); exposure to radioactive substances (HO 6); power-driven hoisting apparatus (HO 7);
power-driven metal-forming, punching, and shearing machines (HO 8); mining, other than coal mining (HO 9); slaughtering,
or meat-packing, processing, or rendering (HO 10); power-driven bakery machines (HO 11); power-driven paper-products
machines (HO 12); manufacturing brick, tile, and kindred products (HO 13); power-driven circular saws (HO 14); wrecking,
demolition, and ship-breaking operations (HO 15); roofing operations (HO 16); and excavation operations (HO 17).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Occupations in agriculture found particularly hazardous and, consequently, prohibited by the Secretary for children
below the age of 16 are contained in subpart E&hyph;1 of 29 CFR part 570. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of changes in the workplace and the introduction of new processes and technologies since the adoption of current
regulatory standards, as well as changes in places where young workers find employment opportunities, the existence
of differing Federal and State standards, and the divergent views on how best to correlate school and work experiences,
the Department is undertaking a comprehensive review of the criteria for child labor employment, and is considering
proposing revisions to Regulations, 29 CFR part 570. Accordingly, this advance notice of proposed rulemaking is
being published to obtain the views of the public with respect to the matters set out below as well as to any other issues
of interest under this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the regulations relating to hours, time and occupations were last amended, the Department has engaged in periodic
reviews of the appropriateness of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, in 1982, the Department published a proposal in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to, among other things, modify the permissible periods of work for 14- and 15-year-olds.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 This proposal would have increased the maximum daily hours from 3 to 4 hours on a school day, and increased the maximum
weekly hours of employment when school is in session from 18 to 24 hours. The proposal would have further permitted
14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 36 hours in any week when school was in session for only a portion of the week due to holidays
or vacation periods. Finally, this proposal would have generally expanded the end-of-day time restriction from
7 to 9 p.m. on school days, and would have established a 10 p.m. end-of-day limit on any day during the summer months or
preceding a nonschool day. The 1982 proposal generated considerable public interest and controversy. The Department
subsequently suspended the proposal from further consideration, and it was not implemented as a final rule.

In the U.S. Congress, bills have been introduced in the House and Senate that include, among other things, hours and
time restrictions for 14- and 15-year-old employees. Bills to reform the FLSA's child labor provisions, H.R. 1106,
introduced February 24, 1993, and S. 86, introduced January 21, 1993, would allow 14- and 15-year-olds to work only
for 3 hours a day and 15 hours a week, or between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. when school is in session. Under H.R. 1106,
16- and 17-year-old minors could not, for the first time, work more than 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, or before 6 a.m.
or after 10 p.m. when school is in session. These hours and time restrictions for 14- and 15-year-olds are similar to
the existing regulations, except that the bills set a 15 hours-per-week limit (rather than the current, regulatory
18).

Under a model State child labor law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition (a child labor advocacy group of 35 organizations
interested in updating child labor laws), the maximum hours of employment for 14- and 15-year-olds would be set at
15 hours a week while in school, and 30 hours a week when school is not in session. For 16- and 17-year-olds, the maximum
work hours would be 30 when school is in session and 40 hours when it is not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

by subtracting from 40 hours, 4 hours for each day that school is in session during the partial school week); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Changing the current 3-hours-per-day limit when school is in session to 4 hours; and

The Department is also aware of the child labor standards established by State governments. In this regard, nearly
all States have employment restrictions applicable to young workers and, although many have adopted standards similar
to the Federal standards for 14- and 15-year-olds, the restrictions vary significantly. For example, most States
limit the number of hours that may be worked in a day when school is not in session to 8 hours; only three States allow more
than 8 hours of work in a day when school is not in session. Most States limit the number of hours that may be worked in a
week when school is not in session to 40 hours; fifteen States, however, permit work in excess of 40 hours when school
is not in session, with the number of hours allowed ranging from 44 to 56. With respect to the number of hours that may
be worked in a week when school is in session, a large number of the States do not have any specific restrictions. Eighteen
States restrict work to no more than 18 hours; two States restrict work to 16 and 15 hours, respectively; two States
restrict work hours to 18 hours but allow more hours when school is not in session for a full week; and seven other States
have provisions that allow work in excess of 20 hours a week when school is in session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the States that restrict daily work hours, 20 provide for a 3-hour limitation on a school day, whether or not the following
day is a school day; one State sets a 3-hour limit on days followed by a school day; and one State permits longer hours
on Saturdays and Sundays. A daily limit of 4 hours is allowed by seven States, with one of these States permitting additional
hours on Fridays and on a school day preceding a day when school is not in session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four States have established maximum permissible daily and/or weekly combined school and work hours, i.e., 10 total
hours of combined school and work on a daily basis, or 48 total hours of combined school and work on a weekly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 28 States, work beyond 7 p.m. is prohibited except during the summer, on a holiday, or on a day preceding a day when
school is not in session, when work until 9 p.m. is allowed in 26 of these States, and until 10 p.m. in the other two States.
Two additional States prohibit work after 7 p.m. at all times. An additional 19 States allow work at least until 8 p.m.;
another five States permit work until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to allowing more working hours during the summer, State standards often distinguish between days preceding
a school day from those preceding a non-school day. Several States also make a distinction between full school weeks
and weeks when school is in partial session because of holiday and vacation time, permitting more hours to be worked
in partial school weeks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Department's Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP), which began in 1969, 14- and 15-year-old
enrollees were initially permitted to work up to 28 hours per week when school was in session and up to 4 hours on a school
day, any portion of which could be during school hours. Studies of WECEP indicated that limited labor market experience
in a controlled school setting had a definite positive impact on the scholastic performance and school attendance
of participating 14- and 15-year-old students. These studies also established that the optimum hours_at which students
attained the greatest educational benefits_were fewer than the maximum hours originally allowed. As a result, in
1975, the permissible hours of employment under WECEP were reduced to 3 hours per day and 23 hours per week, and these
revised standards were adopted in final regulations published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 3, 1975. See 29 CFR 570.35a(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also aware that some employers of young workers have adopted special programs designed to achieve
complementary integration of educational and work experiences. Such employers may, for example, ascertain young
workers' grade point averages (GPA) at the time of hiring; arrange work schedules, subject to parental consent, to
accommodate the scholastic needs of students; allow young workers to study at the workplace; give bonuses for superior
academic achievement or school attendance; monitor young workers' academic performance and school attendance
during employment; and ensure that students, prior to hiring, know their employment rights and the regulations applicable
to minors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comments on whether there is a need for changes in the requirements of Child Labor Reg. 3 for students
participating in programs under statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems advocated by the School-to-Work
initiative jointly sponsored by the Departments of Education and Labor (see 59 FR 5266 (February 3, 1994) and 59 FR
11154 (March 9, 1994)). Programs developed under this initiative are intended to give youth access to education and
training opportunities that will prepare them for high-skill, high-wage careers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, for the reasons discussed above, is particularly interested in obtaining public comment on the appropriateness
and feasibility of the following matters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should greater flexibility be allowed in the permissible hours of work for 14- and 15-year-olds whose employers
have a formal ``employer-parent-school'' program that links meaningful work experiences with support for the attainment
of the student-employee's educational goals and ongoing academic performance? Commenters are requested to include
specific recommendations as to the standards or criteria that should be considered for inclusion in any future rulemaking
to define such special programs, and as to the changes in permissible work hours that would be appropriate for 14- and
15-year-olds whose employers maintain such programs. Commenters are also requested to provide information regarding
the implications for employer recordkeeping that might be necessary for the Department to monitor compliance with
the standards for any such programs, and recommendations for how these recordkeeping requirements should be addressed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The current regulations contain an end-of-day restriction of 7 p.m. on days when school is in session. A less restrictive
time of 9 p.m. is permitted during the summer vacation period defined in the regulations as June 1 through the Labor
Day holiday. When school is in session, the regulations make no distinction between a day preceding a school day and
one preceding a non-school day, i.e., typically Fridays, Saturdays, and days before a school holiday. Should there
be different restrictions on times of work on days preceding a non-school day and, if so, why? Would any such changes
interfere with the schooling, health, or well-being of young workers? If an end-of-day restriction different from
7 p.m. is appropriate on days preceding a non-school day, what should the time restriction be on such days, and why?
Should the Department consider a later end-of-day time for work during the summer months when school is not in session?
If so, what should that time be and why? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The regulations currently limit the daily hours that may be worked by 14- and 15-year-olds to 3 hours on days when
school is in session; 8 hours when school is not in session. Should a distinction be made in the number of hours that may
be worked on a day preceding a non-school day (typically Friday, Saturday, and the day before a school holiday) and,
if so, how many hours should be permitted and why? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Weekly hours for 14- and 15-year-olds are limited by the regulations to 18 hours when school is in session. While
some States permit more hours, only two limit permissible weekly hours to less than the 18-hour standard, one to 16
and another to 15. On the other hand, the child labor reform bill pending in the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R.
1106) and the Model state law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition would limit the number of hours that may be worked
each week to 15. Should the existing Federal standard be changed and, if so, how many hours should be permitted and why?
Should a distinction be made for those weeks when school is in session less than five days?

5. Traditionally, schools were not ``in session'' during the summer months and the regulations reflected this common
schedule by providing less-restrictive hours and time limitations during the summer vacation period between June
1 and the Labor Day holiday. School systems, however, have begun converting to non-traditional attendance schedules
and remain open year-round. For example, some public and private schools have implemented academic quarter-year,
trimester, or other alternative attendance schedules under which the schools schedule classes year-round, but
not all students are attending school at any point in time. For these schools, the traditional concept of the ``summer
vacation break'' between June 1 and Labor Day has become irrelevant. Additionally, home education programs are now
more common, not only in school jurisdictions where the public schools operate on uniform attendance calendars applicable
to all students, but also in school jurisdictions where the public schools operate year-round or on a platoon system.
Should the regulations be changed to accommodate different structures for when school is ``in session'' and what
are the particular changes that should be made to reflect the characteristics of alternative school schedules? If
the concept is based on the schedule for school attendance of individual student-employees (rather than the entire
school system), how do employers and student-employees determine when different hours restrictions are applicable
and what records would have to be maintained to ensure compliance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also reviewing the occupational provisions contained in Reg. 3 to determine what changes, modifications,
or clarifications, if any, are appropriate for 14- and 15-year-old employees. The Department is interested in obtaining
public comment on all aspects of these provisions, including the following matters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Section 570.34(b)(5), promulgated prior to the advent of the fast food industry, prohibits cooking by 14- and 15-year-olds
employed by retail and food establishment cooking at soda fountains, lunch counters, snack bars, or cafeteria serving
counters. This prohibition has been interpreted by the Department to allow cooking only when the activity is in ``plain
view'' of customers. Thus, the cooking prohibition applies to full service restaurants and certain fast food restaurants
where the cooking configuration does not permit customers to plainly view the cooking activity. Should cooking be
permitted in retail and food establishments, and, if so, what restrictions, if any, would be appropriate to ensure
the safety and health of young workers? Should all cooking be prohibited, and, if so, why? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 570.33(b) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in any occupation which involves ``*&blank;*&blank;*
any power-driven machinery other than office machines.'' The operation of certain power-driven devices, equipment,
and tools in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments is expressly permitted by &sect;570.34.
In such industries, 14- and 15-year-olds may, for example, operate vacuum cleaners, floor waxers, dishwashers,
toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee grinders. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds
are also permitted to operate office machines in connection with office and clerical work and cash registers in connection
with retail sales work. Should any of the machines, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
etc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
expressly permitted in Reg. 3 be reconsidered because their use adversely affects the health and well-being of such
workers? If so, why? Are there power-driven machines, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
etc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the contemporary workplace not now expressly permitted by Reg. 3 which 14- and 15-year-olds should be allowed to
operate? If so, identify the machines and explain why their use should be permitted. Also, questions periodically
arise about the meaning of ``power-driven'' and whether the term includes tools, equipment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
etc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that are activated by battery power, i.e., many tools and devices are now power-activated by rechargeable battery
units. Should the term ``power-driven'' include equipment, tools, etc. powered by such sources, and why or why not?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In addition, consideration is being given to two clarifying modifications which would incorporate existing Departmental
enforcement policy into the regulations. Section 570.34(b)(7) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from working in freezers
and meat coolers. Such workers are prohibited from working as dairy stock clerks, meat clerks, deli clerks, produce
clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks where their duties would require them to enter and remain in coolers or freezers
for prolonged periods. Inventory and cleanup work involving prolonged stays in freezers and coolers also is prohibited.
On the other hand, food preparers in fast food restaurants or cashiers in grocery stores whose duties require entry
to such refrigeration equipment only momentarily to retrieve items are not considered as working in coolers and freezers
for enforcement purposes. Because this traditional interpretation of the ``cooler and freezer'' prohibition is
not specifically contained in the regulations, a regulatory clarification may be appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, a regulatory clarification to reflect longstanding policy concerning solicitations for newspaper
subscriptions may be appropriate. Section 13(d) of the FLSA exempts from the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor
provisions (&sect;&sect;6, 7, and 12) ``*&blank;*&blank;* any employee engaged in the delivery of newspapers to
the consumer.'' Accordingly, such work is outside the scope of the child labor regulations. However, the Department
has held, on the basis of a legal opinion from the Solicitor, that the ``newspaper'' exemption does not apply when the
minor is performing nonexempt work such as participation in a sales blitz where newspaper subscriptions are solicited
outside the assigned paper route for delivery by other delivery persons. Should this enforcement position be incorporated
in the provisions of Child Labor Reg. 3? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes the delicate balance between the value of jobs that provide positive, formative experiences,
and the negative effects that excessive hours of employment of youth can have on their academic performance, and their
health and well-being. Public comments, which should include supporting data whenever available, are specifically
invited on such relevant factors as:

II. Nonagricultural Hazardous Occupations Orders for the Employment of Youth Under 18 Years of Age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first seven HOs were developed under the direction of the Children's Bureau between 1939 and 1946. In 1946, authority
for the program was transferred from the Children's Bureau to the Department of Labor under Reorganization Plan No.
2. HOs 8 through 17 were issued by the Bureau of Labor Standards between 1950 and 1963. In the intervening years, the
Department has made some clarifying modifications to these HOs that largely incorporate Departmental interpretations
and enforcement policy, and hazardous occupations in agricultural were promulgated in 1970. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of various recommendations made by the Department's Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC), a notice of
proposed rulemaking was published to clarify or modify HO 2, HO 10, and HO 12 on October 23, 1990 (55 FR 42812). The final
rule, published on November 20, 1991 (56 FR 58626), clarified the existing HOs to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Eliminate exemption procedures contained in HO 2 which allowed minors under 18 years of age to work as school bus
drivers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Specify that restaurants, fast food establishments, and other retail establishments are subject to HO 10 prohibiting
minors under the age of 18 from using power-driven meat processing equipment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Specifically provide that meat slicers are meat processing equipment within the meaning of the HO 10 prohibitions;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Amend HO 12 to expressly prohibit minors under the age of 18 from using power-driven paper baling machinery in the
processing of waste paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CLAC made a number of additional recommendations which were not included in the HO 2, 10, and 12 rulemaking. For
example, the CLAC recommended that HO 10 be amended to also include bacon slicing machines in the list of prohibited
machines, and to prohibit the use of such machines without regard to the purpose of their use, i.e., power-driven meat
processing machines used primarily for processing products other than meat. The CLAC also was of the view that food
processing in industries other than meat processing, such as poultry, fish, and seafood processing, should be studied
by the Department to determine the need for protecting young workers from hazardous activity. With respect to HO 2,
the CLAC made several recommendations, including defining and delimiting the terms ``occasional and incidental''
driving and ``outside helper,'' specifically prohibiting the operation of trucks on private property, and specifically
excluding motorcycles, mopeds, or similar vehicles from the ``occasional and incidental'' exception. With respect
to HO 11, the CLAC recommended a complete ban on the operation of all power-driven bakery machinery, and also recommended
further study of power-driven paper products machines addressed in HO 12.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of particular concern to the CLAC was the lack of sufficient and relevant data to support comprehensive review of existing
HOs or findings that certain contemporary occupations, processes, machinery and worksites are particularly hazardous
for employment of youths under age 18, or detrimental to their health or well-being. The lack of comprehensive statistics
on minors injured in the workplace has been a longstanding concern of the Department. Historically, some limited
information was generated, largely from secondary sources and statistical records from the few States that compiled
worker compensation data, to support the case for each of the existing HOs. Fundamental to some of the existing HOs
(e.g., HO 15, shipbreaking), however, was the notion that work found to be particularly hazardous or detrimental
to the health and well-being of adult workers would be injurious to minor workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address this concern, the Department is continuing its efforts to develop reliable youth injury statistics through
enhancements of information reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS is redesigning its Occupational
Safety and Health Statistical reporting system to collect more comprehensive work-related injury and illness data
on all workers, including young workers. This new system, the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, will
collect information from about 280,000 establishments from a sampling frame of approximately six million establishments.
The new survey will include data by occupation, age, gender, race, and length of service with details on, among other
things, the nature of the injury/illness, the part of body affected, the primary and secondary sources of the injury/illness,
and the event or exposure leading to the injury/illness. BLS has developed another major safety and health data reporting
system with its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries program. This data base includes information on fatally injured
workers (industry, occupation, age, sex, and race) and the fatal events (nature of the injury and how it happened).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that such injury data is essential to support ongoing comprehensive and systematic reviews
of occupations, processes, machinery, and worksites which are particularly hazardous for workers under 18 years
of age, or detrimental to their health or well-being. While such data will enhance the Department's ability to pinpoint
patterns of injuries and illness by various characteristics, i.e., problems areas, specific information about
workplaces, processes, and machines causing injuries or illness must still be identified, e.g., data can indicate
that a ``machine'' was the object which produced injuries in a particular industry, but specific information on the
type of machine and/or its peculiar characteristics may continue to be a key part of HO determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's review of State child labor laws supports the view of the CLAC that the existing HOs need to be revisited
and that contemporary circumstances may warrant new or different protections for minors under the age of 18. The standards
in those States that regulate employment under age 18 prohibit employment on certain types of machines, in work involving
hazardous substances, in hazardous locations, in dangerous occupations, and in specific industries. While specific
prohibitions vary widely among these States, a significant number of States have promulgated work prohibitions
in areas of particular interest to the Department: At least nine States (Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana,
Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Washington) prohibit exposure to carcinogenic, corrosive or toxic
substances; a number of States (Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, and Pennsylvania) prohibit
work on electric apparatus or wiring; four States (Illinois, North Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin) now prohibit
exposure to body fluids and infectious agents; and several States (Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota,
and Washington) place restrictions on work above specified heights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department is aware of Congressional interest in the updating of workplace protections for minors under
the age of 18. The bills referred to above, H.R. 1106 and S. 86, would direct the Secretary of Labor to find and declare
HOs prohibiting the employment of minors in poultry processing, fish and seafood processing, and in the handling
of pesticides. In addition, H.R. 1106 would, among other things, eliminate any exemption from the motor vehicle operation
prohibition in HO 2 except for driving by a 17-year-old that is ``secondary and incidental'' to the minor's main occupation;
and expressly apply HO 10 to restaurants and fast food establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department is interested in obtaining public comment on any modifications, deletions, clarifications,
or other changes that may be appropriate in existing HOs, and any areas of work that should be addressed by new HOs, public
comment is specifically invited on the appropriateness and feasibility of the following:

1. Food Processing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HO 10 currently prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in certain occupations involving slaughtering, meat-packing
or processing, or rendering. There are no comparable restrictions involving poultry processing and fish and seafood
processing. Should the Department adopt restrictions in these industries, and, if so, are there particular machines
or operations which should be restricted? To what extent are minors under 18 employed in such industries, and what
is the nature of the work performed? Should such restrictions encompass all food processing? Do studies, injury and
illness data, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
etc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
exist which support prohibiting the employment of minors under the age of 18 in all food processing activity? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Hazardous Wastes and Toxic Substances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing regulations do not address exposures to hazardous wastes and toxic substances in nonagricultural employment.
In agriculture, the handling of or applying toxic agricultural chemicals by youth under the age of 16 is prohibited
(see &sect;570.71(a)(9)). The model State child labor law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition, discussed above,
would ban all occupations involving the loading, mixing, applying, handling, or working around or near any fertilizer,
herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, insecticides, and/or any other chemical. In addition, this model legislation
would prohibit the loading, handling, mixing, or applying of chemicals, including cleaning agents or disinfectants,
which could result in allergic reactions, poisonings, or internal or external injuries. The use or handling of heavy
metals, including mercury and lead, would also be prohibited by the proposed model legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of States have adopted standards along the same lines. Several States, for example, prohibit exposure to
carcinogenic, corrosive, or toxic substances. Working with lead, working in the manufacturing of paint, acids or
poisons, and exposure to asbestos and related substances are other areas banned by particular States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Is there a commonly understood definition of toxic or hazardous substances, and what standards or criteria would
be appropriate for use in Federal standards for workers under 18 years old? Should different standards apply to 14-
and 15-year-olds? Are there data to support such standards or criteria? Should specific substances or materials
be identified in an HO, or would a more generic framework be appropriate? Is an occupational and/or industry framework
a reasonable alternative, and, if so, which occupations and/or industries create the greatest concerns that such
exposure is detrimental to the health and well-being of youth under age 18? What are the compliance difficulties associated
with limiting employment in this area, and how can they be minimized? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Electric Apparatus and Wiring
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Available injury and illness data indicate a high incidence of fatal injuries in the construction industry resulting
from electric shock. A significant number of these deaths were suffered by workers between the ages of 16 and 19. Construction
industry accidents involving electric shock are attributed to working directly with electricity, using hand held
power driven tools, from electric cords, and from ladders, scaffolds and other equipment coming in contact with overhead
wires. While the current child labor regulations do not deal with electricity, at least six States prohibit young
workers from working with electric apparatus and wiring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should consideration be given to establishing a prohibition of such activity in the construction industry? Why?
Should a broad-based generic prohibition be considered as opposed to occupational-specific prohibitions, and,
if so, how should the prohibition be formulated? Should an exemption be permitted for employment of 16- and 17-year-old
apprentices and student learners as in the case of certain other HOs (HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Heights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under HO 16, all occupations in roofing operations are prohibited. The HO's prohibition does not include gutter and
downspout work; the construction of the sheathing or base of roofs; or the installation of television antennas, air
conditioners, exhaust and ventilating equipment, or similar appliances attached to roofs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several States currently restrict work above certain heights by young workers. These standards either involve work
performed at heights above 10 feet or at heights 6 feet above ground, and include elevated surfaces such as scaffolds
and ladders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While work in roofing occupations is specifically prohibited by HO 16, work in other occupations requiring work on
a roof are not. Should all occupations involving work on roofs be prohibited? If so, why? As above, should consideration
be given to the possible development of a generic restriction with cross-industry application or to particular occupations
and/or industries, e.g., the construction industry? Also, should an exemption be permitted for employment of 16-
and 17-year-old apprentices and student learners? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Body Fluids and Infectious Agents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The States of Wisconsin and Washington have prohibited all minors from working in occupations involving exposure
to body fluids including blood or infectious agents, and in 1993 the States of North Dakota and Illinois banned such
employment for minors under the age of 16. Other States accomplish a similar objective using an industry/occupation
approach. In Virginia, for example, minors under the age of 16 cannot work as laboratory helpers, therapists, orderlies,
or nurses' aides in any hospital, nursing home, clinic, or other establishment providing care for resident patients.
Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited by the State of Washington from employment in the occupation of nurses' aid,
except as a student or after training, and by the State of Wisconsin from employment in hospitals and nursing homes.
The model State law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition, referred to above, would ban all occupations involving the
handling or storage of blood, blood products, body fluids and body tissues, and medical or other dangerous wastes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What evidence exists to support a finding that such exposures are particularly hazardous, or detrimental to the health
or well-being of young workers, or that they are at risk in the absence of work prohibitions? Are other governmental
safeguards, i.e., standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), sufficient
to protect minors? As above, would an occupation/industry-specific approach, in contrast to a generic formulation,
be more feasible, and, if so, why? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Student-Learner Exceptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another area of the regulations under review concerns the student-learner provisions in &sect;570.50(c). Certain
of the HOs (HO 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17) contain an exemption for the employment of student-learners between the ages
of 16 and 18. For the exemption to apply, &sect;&sect;570.50(c)(2)(i) and (ii) require a written agreement which
provides that the work of the student-learner in a vocational training program involving these otherwise prohibited
occupations and activities must be ``incidental'' to the training and that the work is ``intermittent and for short
periods of time.'' The Department is seeking comment on whether there is a need for changes to these two requirements
for student-learners participating in programs under statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems advocated
by the School-to-Work initiative jointly sponsored by the Departments of Education and Labor (see 59 FR 5266 (February
3, 1994) and 59 FR 11154 (March 9, 1994)). Programs developed under this initiative are intended to give youth access
to education and training opportunities that will prepare them for high-skill, high-wage careers. The Department
solicits public comment on whether any changes are needed to these two requirements in order to facilitate this objective.
The changes being considered would be limited to student-learners under School-to-Work Opportunities programs
and would affect only those HOs which have traditionally included a student-learner exception. School-to-Work
Opportunities programs would remain subject to the requirements that the activity be performed under the direct
and close supervision of a qualified and experienced person, that safety instructions be given by the school and correlated
by the employer with on-the-job training, and that a schedule of organized and progressive skill development activities
be prepared. Also, work done in prohibited occupations would be an essential and integral part of the student-learner's
training program. If there are no changes made to the student-learner exception, would this significantly foreclose
school-to-work training opportunities? If this were the case, what other alternatives should the Department consider
to facilitate the effectiveness of employment in the School-to-Work Opportunities program?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In soliciting comments on the above or any other aspects of the child labor regulations considered appropriate by
commenters, such as the HO 10 exemption for bacon-slicing machines, the Department is specifically interested in
data, reports, cost-benefit analyses, studies and other documentation which support the positions taken or otherwise
relate to the Department's objective to develop updated, realistic health and safety standards for today's young
workers. Any impact on school-to-work transition programs should also be discussed.
