SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing substantial revisions to the
disclosure framework applicable to commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'').
The proposed amendments reflect the Commission's experience in applying the disclosure requirements set forth
in part 4 of the Commission's rules and significant evolution in the purposes, structure and activities of the managed
funds marketplace. These proposed modifications of the CPO and CTA disclosure framework are designed to achieve
greater simplicity, focus and clarity in performance history presentations; streamlining of other required disclosures;
and a more concise and readable format for disclosure documents.

 requires that each CPO registered or required to be registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'' or ``CEA''),
7 U.S.C. 1 et seq. (1988 &amp; Supp. 1992), provide prospective participants with a disclosure document containing
the information specified in the rule on or before the date it solicits, accepts or receives funds, securities or other
property from prospective participants for a pool it operates or intends to operate. Each CTA who is registered or
required to be registered is also required, by Rule 4.31, to deliver a disclosure document prior to or at the time of
soliciting or entering into an agreement to direct or guide the commodity interest account of a prospective client.
These requirements were first promulgated on January 8, 1979, when the Commission published part 4 of its regulations
relating to the operations and activities of CPOs and CTAs.

I. Summary of Proposed Rule Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon more than fifteen years of experience with administering the part 4 disclosure framework for CPOs and CTAs,
the Commission has undertaken a comprehensive review of the disclosure requirements for CPOs and CTAs to identify
areas in which the regulatory structure can be streamlined or simplified, while continuing to provide appropriate
customer protection. Rules 4.7 and 4.8 were adopted in August 1992 as a result of the first phase of this review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposal represents the second phase of the Commission's review of part 4, which will also include consideration
of the appropriateness of a two-part format for pool disclosure documents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is seeking public comment on proposed revisions of Rules 4.21 and 4.31. The amendments have three major
purposes: (1) Simplification of past performance disclosures; (2) reduction of required disclosures as to matters
of secondary relevance; and (3) clarification and modernization of various requirements. In addition, Rules 4.21
and 4.31 would be redrafted, reorganized and renumbered with a view towards greater clarity, simplicity and congruence
with contemporary managed funds practices.

57 FR 34853 (August 7, 1992). Subject to certain conditions, Rule 4.7(a) provides relief from the specific requirements
of Rules 4.21 and 4.23 and from certain of the requirements of Rule 4.22 to registered CPOs with respect to pools sold
only to ``qualified eligible participants'' and satisfying the other conditions set forth in the rule. Rule 4.7(b)
provides relief from the specific requirements of Rules 4.31 and 4.32 to registered CTAs with respect to the accounts
of ``qualified eligible clients'' as defined in the rule. Rule 4.8 permits the CPOs of certain privately offered pools
to solicit participants for those pools upon filing with the Commission and delivering to prospective participants
the disclosure document required by Rule 4.21, eliminating the twenty-one day pre-filing requirement of Rule 4.21(g)
for such pools.

If determined to be appropriate, such a document could consist of: A summary disclosure document, provided to all
prospective pool participants, containing core information relevant to a determination to participate in the pool;
and a supplemental document, which would be made available upon request, containing additional and more detailed
information of interest to some investors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Performance Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, past performance disclosures would be simplified and streamlined as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All past performance presentations for pools would be reduced to a summary format containing specified core information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For pools which have been in operation for at least three years, the only past performance record required generally
would be that of the pool offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For pools with less than a three-year history, only the performance records of the pool offered, other pools operated
by the CPO, CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the aggregate initial futures margins and commodity option
premiums for the pool offered and investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of the pool offered
generally would be required. If the CPO has less than a three-year history, the past performance records of the CPO's
principals would be required to be disclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Certain performance data of secondary relevance to the pool offering would be replaced by a statement indicating
whether that performance was ``adverse,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the performance was one hundred basis points lower than the relevant Treasury Bill rate or the pool had to be terminated
due to poor performance pursuant to a loss termination provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Non-Performance Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-performance disclosures would be revised as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Required disclosures concerning the litigation history of futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') would be
significantly reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Disclosure of the business backgrounds of principals would be limited to principals who participate in making
trading or operational decisions for the pool or CTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Requirements for disclosure of conflicts of interest would no longer make specific reference to FCMs and introducing
brokers (``IBs''). However, a general requirement to disclose conflicts of interest on the part of any persons providing
services to the pool, which would encompass FCMs and IBs as well as persons who may not be Commission registrants, would
be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The required description of each fee and expense of the pool would be supplemented by a tabular presentation of fees
and expenses setting forth how the ``break-even point'' for the pool is calculated. The break-even point is the per-unit
profit that the pool must realize during its first year for a participant to recoup his initial investment in the pool.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Format Improvements to Enhance Readability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of revisions to the rules are being proposed to enhance the accessibility and prominence of relevant disclosures.
Disclosure documents would be required to contain a table of contents. General information concerning the pool,
including the break-even point, would be required to be set forth in the forepart of the document. The number and content
of various previously required bold-face ``boilerplate'' cautionary statements would be reduced and all information
voluntarily provided would be required to follow the relevant required disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Other Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes are also proposed to generally facilitate pool offerings, particularly with respect to areas of overlap
or potential inconsistency with Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') rules. Thus, under the revisions,
CPOs may update pool disclosure documents every nine months, consistent with SEC requirements, rather than every
six months, as under current CFTC rules. In addition, CPOs may provide accredited investors with a notice of intended
offering and term sheet, prior to delivery of a disclosure document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar changes are proposed to be made to the requirements applicable to CTA disclosure documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are more specifically discussed in the section-by-section analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In announcing the adoption of part 4 in 1979, the Commission stated that Rule 4.21, the basic disclosure document requirement
for CPOs, was intended ``to protect pool participants_particularly those who are unsophisticated in financial
matters_by ensuring that they are informed about the material facts regarding the pool before they commit their funds.''
<FOOTCITE>
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, Rule 4.31 was premised, in part, upon the view that ``a prospective [CTA] client or subscriber should be
aware of the advisor's commodity and general business experience if he is to make an informed decision as to whether
or not to avail himself of the advisor's services.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4.21 requires the disclosure document for commodity pools to contain various types of information concerning
the pool; the pool's CPO and CTA, and their principals; the FCM through which the pool's trades will be executed and
cleared; and the pool's IB, if applicable. This information includes, among other things, the pool's and CPO's form
of organization (Rule 4.21(a)(1)(i)); the pool's investment objectives (Rule 4.21(a)(1)(viii)); the business
backgrounds of the CPO and CTA and their principals (Rule 4.21(a)(2)); material administrative, civil or criminal
actions within the five years preceding the date of the disclosure document against the CPO, CTA, FCM and IB and their
principals (Rule 4.21(a)(13)(i)); conflicts of interest on the part of the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals
with respect to the pool (Rule 4.21(a)(3)(i)); the performance records of the pool and its CTA (Rules 4.21 (a)(4) and
(a)(5), respectively) and, if the pool has traded commodity interests for less than twelve months, the performance
of each other pool operated by the CPO and by each of its principals (Rule 4.21(a)(4)(i)(B)); a complete description
of each kind of expense that the pool has incurred in its preceding fiscal year or is expected to incur in its current
fiscal year (Rule 4.21(a)(7)) and of commissions or other fees that are paid or may be paid by the pool, its CPO, CTA or
their principals in connection with solicitations for the pool (Rule 4.21(a)(14)); and risk disclosure and cautionary
statements (Rules 4.21(a)(17) and 4.21(a)(18), respectively). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disclosure document for CTAs must contain, among other matters, the name and business background of the CTA and
each principal thereof (Rules 4.21(a)(1) and 4.21(a)(2), respectively); a description of the trading program (Rule
4.31(a)(1)(iii)); the types of commodity interests the CTA intends to trade (Rule 4.31(a)(v)); the performance
record of the CTA and its principals (Rule 4.31(a)(3)); a description of any conflict of interest regarding the trading
program on the part of the CTA, FCM, IB and their principals (Rule 4.31(a)(5)); material actions against the foregoing
persons (Rule 4.31(a)(7)); and risk disclosure and cautionary statements (Rules 4.31(a)(8) and 4.31(a)(9), respectively).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the adoption of Rules 4.21 and 4.31 in 1979, the number of registered CPOs has more than doubled and the number
of CTAs has increased nearly threefold.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assets under the 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
management of CPOs have also grown dramatically

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 and the range of available futures and option contracts has increased substantially.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, during the past decade, pool operations and investments have reflected increased diversity and complexity.
When Rule 4.21 came into effect, most CPOs operated one or two pools, and pools usually had one CPO which generally directed
the commodity interest trading for the pool or engaged the services of a CTA who invested pool assets directly in commodity
interest contracts. Increasingly, however, CPOs operate multiple pools, and commodity pools' and CTAs' investments
are more diverse and complex.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A single commodity pool may engage multiple CTAs to provide advisory services for the pool and also invest in other
commodity pools (``investee pools'') or securities funds in order to access the services of particular traders or
advisors, to employ multiple trading strategies or programs, or to diversify its portfolio.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Investee pools'' may also hold investments in other funds, resulting in multi-tiered structures of commodity
pools and other investment vehicles. Because of the proliferation of trading strategies and growing specialization
of CTAs, an increasing number of pools also retain ``trading managers'' to recommend or select CTAs for the pool or
to select funds for investment of the pool's assets. Many CPOs and trading managers follow dynamic asset allocation
strategies whereby the performance of the pool's CTAs is continuously reviewed and the selection of CTAs and allocation
of assets among them are subject to frequent modification. Other commodity pools are formed as vehicles for collective
access to particular CTAs whose services would not be readily available on a managed account basis and who are expected
to provide advisory services to the pool throughout its existence.

Figures compiled by the National Futures Association indicate that the assets of commodity pools (both public and

(``MAR'') estimates public pool assets at $15 million in 1975, $250 million in 1980 and $435 million in 1983. These
data reflect, in part, the increased use of managed futures by collective investment vehicles seeking to diversify
their portfolios or manage the risks of securities, fixed income instruments or other assets. Concomitantly, institutional
users such as state pension plans have increased their participation in managed futures. See Peltz,

For example, in addition to investing directly and indirectly in commodity interest contracts traded on U.S. contract
markets, pools and managed accounts may engage in a variety of other transactions, such as swaps, Separate Trading
of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (also known as STRIPS), and repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements.

Survey of Commodity Pool Operators
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, (the ``Pool Survey'') dated January 1991, the Commission's Division of Economic Analysis surveyed sixty-five
large CPOs (defined as those with over $10 million in net assets under management) representing about 94 percent of
the total $7.8 billion in net assets reported by the approximately 1,200 CPOs registered as of September 30, 1988.
The Pool Survey indicated that, on average, each large CPO operated about four pools and employed about two CTAs per
pool. At the upper end of the range, the Pool Survey showed two CPOs accounting for 20 or more pools each and three pools
employing the services of as many as 14 CTAs each. The National Futures Association reported that, as of October 1993,
for 300 pools the CPO also served as CTA, 376 pools had one CTA and 216 pools had more than one CTA.

In implementing its statutory mandate to regulate the activities of CPOs and CTAs, the Commission has endeavored
to refine its rules as appropriate to respond to changing market conditions and to simplify and streamline the disclosure
process in a manner consistent with customer protection. For example, in 1985, the Commission adopted Rule 4.5, which,
as last amended,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provides an exclusion from the definition of the term ``commodity pool operator'' for the operators of specified
types of collective investment vehicles operating pursuant to other regulatory frameworks, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, certain pension plans, registered investment companies, bank or trust company collective funds and insurance
company separate accounts, whose use of futures and commodity option transactions is limited to hedging and to non-hedging
transactions for which initial margin deposits and option premiums do not exceed five percent of the liquidation
value of the entity's portfolio.

Rule 4.12(b) allows the use of a simplified disclosure document that does not contain, among other things, the past
performance records, risk disclosure and cautionary statements otherwise required by Rule 4.21. Thus, a pool's
securities offering memorandum should require little supplementation to meet the requirements for a pool disclosure
document under Rule 4.12(b).

In 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 4.12(b), which provides relief from certain requirements of Rules 4.21, 4.22
and 4.23 with respect to pools that commit no more than ten percent of the fair market value of their assets to establish
commodity interest positions and trade such commodity interests in a manner solely incidental to their securities
trading. Also in 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 4.14(a)(8), which provides registration relief to investment
advisers registered as such with the SEC, who provide commodity interest trading advice to trading vehicles that
are excluded from the definition of the term ``pool'' under Rule 4.5 or are qualifying entities for which a notice of
eligibility has been filed under Rule 4.5, provided that the investment adviser's commodity interest trading advice
is solely incidental to the adviser's business of providing securities advice and consistent with Rule 4.5, and that
the investment adviser does not otherwise hold itself out as a CTA.

Regulation S generally provides that the registration requirements of the Securities Act do not apply to offers and
sales of securities that occur outside the United States and provides two safe harbors from those requirements for
specified offerings where no ``directed selling efforts'' are made in the United States. ``Directed selling efforts''
are activities undertaken for the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, conditioning of the
market in the United States for the securities being offered. See 55 FR 18306 at 18307 (May 2, 1990).

In addition, the Division of Trading and Markets (``Division'') has issued relief on a case-by-case basis to facilitate
application of the disclosure requirements in the context of new market conditions not contemplated by the existing
regulatory framework, such as multiple CTA and fund-of-funds structures, with the objective of fostering clear
and succinct disclosure of material information, especially concerning fees and the manner in which proceeds of
the offering will be used. In many cases, strict application of existing disclosure requirements to pools whose CPOs
have voluminous performance histories or which retain multiple CTAs or invest in multiple investee funds may result
in such extensive track record disclosure that past performance records generally may be given undue emphasis and
the most germane data given insufficient prominence. These effects have been mitigated in appropriate circumstances
through grants of exemptive or no-action relief. For example, in Interpretative Letter No. 92&hyph;12,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Division granted relief from required disclosures (including disclosure of past performance records) concerning
CTAs and investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the assets of the investor pool. The CPO had an operating
history of more than three years and changed the pools' CTAs frequently based on its continuous analysis of over 500
CTAs. This relief has since been made available to other CPOs in similar circumstances.

In Interpretative Letter 94&hyph;10, the Division granted relief permitting a CPO to use a summary format containing
specified core information to present, in the disclosure document of a single-advisor pool, its past performance
with respect to other pools operated by the CPO, none of which was advised by the same CTA as the single-advisor pool.
The CTA advising the single-advisor pool had a ten-year track record that would be fully disclosed in the disclosure
document of the single-advisor pool and the full performance record of the CPO's other pools would be available upon
request.

[Current Transfer Binder], Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;25,993 (December 27, 1993). In Interpretative Letter
No. 93&hyph;107 the Division granted relief permitting a CPO to omit disclosure of the past performance of certain
single-advisor pools in the CPO's disclosure documents for two multi-advisor pools, provided that the CPO gave a
brief description of the single-advisor pools and made their performance records available upon request. This relief
was based upon representations that the CPO, which played an active role as an administrator and asset allocator for
the multi-advisor pools, performed no asset allocation functions for the single-advisor pools and that the single-advisor
pools served as vehicles to provide access to commodity pools advised by certain experienced CTAs whose minimum investment
levels for managed accounts would otherwise have been prohibitive for individual investors. The CPO's track record
as an asset allocator would be more significant in the context of multi-advisor funds than its track record in the context
of single advisor funds, where the skill of the individual CTA would be of greater interest to prospective participants.

Staff comment letters have stated that pool disclosure documents should provide all information required by Rule
4.21 for each investee pool, ``generally at the same level of detail as though the investee pool were providing its
own separate disclosure document,'' but that reduced disclosures were appropriate where less than twenty-five
percent of the assets of the pool offered is invested in the investee pool. Moreover, the staff indicated that it is
always willing to address specific requests for relief and has done so in appropriate circumstances.

 to review and make recommendations concerning CPO and CTA disclosure documents. The Special Committee's recommendations
were presented to NFA's Board of Directors in February 1994. On March 15, 1994, the NFA submitted to the Commission
proposed amendments to, and interpretations of, its Compliance Rules which were based upon the Special Committee's
recommendations. NFA's rule submission consists of several parts. Proposed revisions of NFA Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13(a)
would require CPOs to comply, not only with specified Commission rules applicable to CPOs' and CTAs' activities and
disclosures, but also with interpretations of those rules issued by NFA's Board of Directors and approved by the Commission.
Separately, new paragraph (b) would be added to Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 to require CPO disclosure documents to
include a ``break-even'' analysis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a computation of the trading profit that a pool must realize in its first year for a participant to recoup its initial
investment, presented in the manner prescribed by the NFA's Board of Directors, including a tabular presentation
of fees and expenses. NFA is also proposing interpretations of proposed Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 relating to disclosure
of past performance information, the computation and presentation of the break-even analysis, the use of pro forma
and extracted results in past performance presentations and other topics addressed by this proposal, including
the disclosure of business backgrounds of CPO and CTA principals, material litigation against FCMs and other past
performance issues. In addition, NFA is proposing to replace paragraph (b)(4) of NFA Rule 2&hyph;29 with a new, more
detailed, paragraph (c) concerning the use of hypothetical trading results. References to the NFA proposal are made

Current Rule 4.21 would be reorganized with a view towards simplification of presentation. Rule 4.21 would continue

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

requirements would be codified in new Rule 4.25. New Rule 4.26 would contain requirements with respect to the use,
amendment and filing of the disclosure document.

is not predictive of future performance results and that inclusion of multiple performance records in disclosure
documents may tend to give undue importance to past performance data. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that
past performance disclosure may serve to reveal negative performance results and the volatility of pool returns.
Consequently, the Commission is proposing to substantially simplify past performance requirements with the objective
of eliminating required disclosure of past performance that is of secondary relevance to the pool offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules are designed to foster clarity and simplicity. This objective would be achieved in part by substituting
a summary of core performance data for the multicolumnar presentations called for under current rules. This new ``capsule''
format, which has recently been used by some CPOs pursuant to exemptive relief issued by the Division of Trading and
Markets on a case-by-case basis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provides a simple, readable and succinct overview of pool performance and substantially reduces the overall quantity
of performance data required to be presented without sacrificing the elements important to customers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The past performance disclosure requirements have also been comprehensively reviewed and revised with a view towards
eliminating or reducing past performance disclosures of secondary importance. As a result, the primary focus of
past performance disclosure would be the performance of the pool offered and for most pools with less than a three year
operating history, upon pools of a similar nature. Only the past performance records of CTAs with responsibility
for managing substantial amounts of a pool's futures or commodity option trading would be required. The performance
of CTAs managing lesser amounts of the pool's futures trading and other performance data of secondary relevance to
the offering would generally not be required except to the extent that such performance was below a specified benchmark
rate of return or resulted in significant losses. The performance of pools dissimilar to the pool offered would be
permitted to be shown in composites, subject to limitations on the types of pools that may be included in a composite.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules also take into account structures in which a trading manager, rather than the pool's CPO, allocates
pool assets, and fund-of-funds structures. In addition, because, under the proposal, the volume of required performance
disclosures would be considerably reduced, the time period for these disclosures would be increased from three to
five years to provide pool participants with a better chronological perspective of the track records presented in
the disclosure document.

Thus, the proposed past performance requirements require presentation of the past performance of the pool itself.
For most pools with at least a three-year track record this would be the only past performance required to be disclosed.
Proposed Rule 4.25(c) would require the following additional disclosures with respect to pools with less than a three-year
history. If the pool has not commenced trading, a short statement to that effect would be required to be prominently
disclosed. The performance of the CPO (or of the pool's trading manager, if applicable) would be required to be disclosed
and if the CPO (trading manager) had less than a three-year trading history, the performance of its trading principals
also would be required.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 If applicable, a legend would be required to disclose the fact that neither the CPO (or trading manager), nor its principals
has any commodity interest trading experience.

This performance would be presented in a capsule format and the performance of pools of a different class than the pool
offered could be presented in a composite format. See discussion of proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii) relating to composites,

With respect to CTAs and investee pools, proposed Rule 4.25(c)(3) would provide for disclosure of the performance
of ``major'' CTAs and investee pools, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's aggregate initial futures margins and commodity option
premiums and investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's assets, to be set forth in the specified
capsule format. The CPO would only be required to indicate any ``adverse performance'' as defined in proposed Rule
4.25(a)(8) on the part of CTAs allocated less than twenty-five but at least ten percent of the pool's futures margins
and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent but at least ten percent
of the assets of the pool offered. No performance disclosure would be required for CTAs allocated less than ten percent
of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums or investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the
pool's assets. If a major CTA or investee pool had no experience in trading commodity interests, a prominent legend
would be required to so indicate. The legend would also indicate the percentage of futures margins and option premiums
allocated to the particular CTA or pool assets allocated to the investee pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past performance disclosure requirements would be codified in Rule 4.25, which would contain three sections. Paragraph
(a) would set forth general principles applicable to pool performance disclosure; paragraph (b) would set forth
the requirements applicable to pools with three or more years history; and paragraph (c) would address other pools.

1. Capsule Performance Presentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 4.21(a)(4) currently requires performance to be disclosed in tables showing at least quarterly the beginning
and ending net asset values for the period, all additions, withdrawals and redemptions, whether voluntary or involuntary,
the net performance for the period, net of additions, withdrawals and redemptions, and the rate of return for the period.
These requirements have been applied in practice such that multiple pages of small-type numerical tables, frequently
including performance data not required by Commission rules, are presented, often mixing without differentiation
the performance of trading vehicles similar to the pool offered and of vehicles different in material respects. Such
performance presentations are voluminous and may give equal weight to relevant data and to data of secondary or marginal
pertinence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing a new summary format for presentation of all required past performance history.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 This format is intended to capture the most significant information concerning a pool's history in a reader-friendly,
largely nontabular form, which would generally permit multiple performance track records to be provided on a single
page. The proposed new format, which is set forth in Rule 4.25(a)(1)(i) for pools and Rule 4.25(a)(1)(ii) for accounts,
calls for core information intended to convey relevant data in a condensed format. The capsule format for pools would
set forth the date when the pool commenced trading, the aggregate gross capital subscriptions for the pool, and the
pool's current net asset value. The ``largest monthly draw-down'' and ``worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-down''
are intended to show that material changes in rates of return may occur. Rates of return would also be included, on a
monthly basis for the pool offered, and on an annual basis for other pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The only exception to the summary format presentation is that a CTA disclosure document would be required to present
the performance of the program offered in the full format currently required by current Rule 4.31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``largest monthly drawn-down'' and the ``worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-down'' would demonstrate the
significant one-month and sustained declines to which commodity pool returns may be subject. Both draw-down figures
would be expressed as a percentage of the pool's net asset value. The largest monthly draw-down would indicate the
largest net asset loss experienced by the pool in any calendar month and the month and year in which it occurred. The
peak-to-valley draw-down would indicate the largest calendar month-to-calendar month continuous net asset loss
experienced by the pool during any period and the months and year in which it occurred. Dating the monthly and peak-to-valley
draw-downs would permit participants to assess whether the losses were connected to market conditions by comparing
the draw-downs of several pools. As explained in the rule, a peak-to-valley draw-down of 4 to 8&hyph;91/25% would
indicate that the peak-to-valley lasted from April to August of 1991 and resulted in a twenty-five percent draw-down
of the pool's net asset value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of return would be presented for each month for the pool offered and for each year for other pools. It would be
computed on a monthly compounded basis in order that the rate of return for a given month will take into account the prior
months' trading profits. Annual rates of return computed on a monthly compounded basis assume reinvestment of accrued
profits and therefore the investment base on which rates of return are calculated is effectively adjusted by these
amounts, presenting a more accurate picture of actual returns realized on an investment. Information currently
required by Rule 4.21(a)(4) concerning additions, withdrawals and redemptions, the beginning and ending net asset
values and the number of units outstanding at the end of each period at least for each quarter, would not be required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed capsule format for CTA accounts would contain similar core information, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the name of the CTA or other person trading the account and the name of the trading program; the date when the CTA began
trading client funds and the date of inception of the program being disclosed; the number of accounts in the program;
the total assets under the management of the CTA and in the trading program; the largest monthly and worst continuous
peak-to-valley draw-downs for the program; and the annual and year-to-date rates of return. Registrants who compute
rates of return for CTA programs on the basis permitted by Advisory 93&hyph;13 would continue to be required to state
the actual and nominal account sizes, as required therein.

on the basis set forth in current Rule 4.21(a)(4)(ii) (proposed to be renumbered as Rule 4.25(a)(6)), as interpreted
by the Commission and to maintain records substantiating such computations in accordance with Rule 1.31.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Current Rule 4.21(a)(4) requires disclosure of the performance of the pool offered and of its CTAs and their principals
for all pools. If the pool offered has less than a twelve-month track record, the performance of the CPO and of each of
its principals must also be disclosed. Under the proposed rules, past performance disclosure requirements would
differ based on whether the pool had a three-year, rather than twelve-month, track record. Generally, where a pool
has at least a three-year track record, the only performance required to be disclosed would be that of the pool offered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that, generally, where a pool has an extensive operational history, presentation of the
pool's own past performance record should fulfill the objectives of past performance disclosure. If, however, the
pool's historical track record occurred under materially different conditions, the track record of the pool alone
may not be sufficient. For example, if the pool was essentially a proprietary trading vehicle investing a relatively
small amount of funds contributed by third party sources, the track record generated may have little or no relevance
to a publicly offered pool. To assure that a pool's three-year history was not acquired under circumstances in which
the pool was essentially a proprietary trading vehicle, proposed Rule 4.25(b) would provide for past performance
disclosure to be limited to that of the pool offered for pools that have traded commodity futures and option contracts
for at least three years with no fewer than fifteen participants who are unaffiliated with the pool's CPO and in which
no more than ten percent of the assets were contributed by the CPO. The pool's performance would be required to be disclosed
for five full calendar years and year-to-date (or, if the pool had less than a five-year history, for the pool's entire
operating history), in the specified capsule format with monthly rates of return. The CPO would be free to include
additional performance records in compliance with the provision relating to voluntary information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment as to whether the performance record of a pool with a three-year operating history
is generally sufficient without supplementary performance data concerning the pool's CTAs or other pools operated
by the CPO. The Commission also requests comment as to whether the offered pool's operating history should be considered
for purposes of the three-year minimum if such history was acquired when the pool differed in some material respect
from the pool as offered, for example, in cases in which the pool's CTA, types of interests traded or the trading program
have been significantly modified or the pool was initially privately offered but is now offered to the public.

3. Pools With Less Than Three Years History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As noted above, current Rule 4.21(a)(4) requires a pool disclosure document to disclose the performance of the pool
offered, of each of the pool's CTAs and of each principal of the CTAs, and, if the pool offered has traded commodity interests
for less than twelve months, the performance of the CPO and each of its principals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preceding section, the Commission is proposing to limit required performance disclosures to
the performance of the pool offered if the pool has at least a three-year performance history. With respect to pools
that have less than a three-year history, proposed Rule 4.25(c) would require presentation of the performance records
of the pool offered, the CPO (or trading manager), the CPO's (or trading manager's) trading principals if the CPO (or
trading manager) has less than a three-year history, and the performance of each ``major'' CTA and investee pool,
i.e., CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and
investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of the pool offered.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and
investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's assets, the sole requirement would be to indicate
any ``adverse'' performance as defined in the rule. No disclosure would be required for CTAs allocated less than ten
percent of the pool's futures margins and option premiums or investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the
pool's assets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules would require that the performance history for the pool offered be presented before any other performance
history in the disclosure document. The performance of pools similar to the pool offered would be presented after
that of the pool offered, on a pool-by-pool basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The performance disclosure requirement of current Rule 4.21(a)(4) focuses on the past performance of the pool offered,
its CTAs, principals of the CTAs and, if the pool has less than a year history, the CPO and each of its principals. As noted
above, these requirements would be largely eliminated for pools with at least a three-year operating history. For
pools with a shorter history, additional past performance records would be required to be disclosed. These requirements
were devised to focus upon the performance of pools similar to the pool offered and of persons responsible for management
of a significant portion of the offered pool's assets. Further, to the extent that performance of principals is required,
unlike the current rule which requires disclosure of the performance of all principals, the proposed rule would require
disclosure of the past performance of ``trading principals'' only. A ``trading principal'' would be defined in proposed
Rule 4.10(m) to mean a principal of a CPO or CTA who participates in making commodity interest trading decisions for
a pool or client or who supervises, or has authority to allocate pool assets to, persons so engaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules also would take into account arrangements in which pools use trading managers to direct their trading.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``trading manager'' is defined in proposed Rule 4.10(j) as any person, other than the pool's CPO, with authority
to allocate pool assets to CTAs or investee pools.

Trading managers are CTAs and are required to be registered as such. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the practice of retaining trading managers to select and monitor the performance of CTAs and investee
pools to which pool assets will be committed has become commonplace. CPOs seek to maximize pool returns by allocating
pool assets based on analysis of the returns achieved by CTAs retained for the pool and investee pools in which the pool
has invested as compared to those of other CTAs and investee pools, and in response to changing market conditions.
CPOs frequently rely on trading managers to continuously review the performance of CTAs and investee pools and allocate
and reallocate pool funds. Because the trading manager, rather than the CPO, conducts the asset allocation activities
for the pool, the Commission believes that the principal focus of the performance disclosure for a pool in which a trading
manager is responsible for allocating the assets should be on the trading manager, rather than the CPO. Thus, when
a pool has a trading manager, the trading manager's performance would replace that of the CPO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to CTAs, the proposed rules would require disclosure of the past performance of CTAs only where they manage
twenty-five percent or more of the pool's futures and commodity option trading and thus would constitute ``major
CTAs,'' as defined in proposed Rule 4.10(k). The proposed rules also would require disclosure of past performance
of investee pools constituting ``major investee pools, that is investee pools allocated twenty-five percent or
more of the pool's assets. The term ``major CTA'' would be defined in Rule 4.10(k) to mean a CTA allocated or intended
to be allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's initial margins for futures contracts and premiums for commodity
options. Proposed Rule 4.10(l) would define ``major investee pool'' as an investee pool allocated or intended to
be allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of a pool. These definitions are intended to include CTAs or
investee pools to whom the CPO of a pool that has not commenced trading intends to make allocations at or above the specified
thresholds. Similarly, CTAs and investee pools to whom the CPO of an operating pool intends to reallocate assets such
that the allocations will total twenty-five percent or more under the margin or total asset standards also would be
included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further reduce the volume of performance data contained in the disclosure document, the proposed rules would eliminate
the requirement to present performance data with respect to CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's
initial margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the
pool's assets and require only that ``adverse'' performance be disclosed as to CTAs allocated ten percent or more
of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated ten percent or more
of the pool's assets. ``Adverse performance'' would be defined in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(8) as an annual rate of return
of one hundred basis points less than the ninety-day Treasury Bill rate on December 31 of the calendar year in which
the performance occurred or the termination of any pool pursuant to a loss termination provision. To disclose adverse
performance, the CPO would indicate the year in which the performance occurred, the rate of return for that year, and
the name of the CPO, CTA or investee pool responsible for the performance. An indication of adverse performance would
be required to be given for the pool's CPO (where the pool had a trading manager whose performance was disclosed in lieu
of that of the CPO), any trading principal of the CPO or trading manager whose performance was not otherwise disclosed,
any CTA, other than a major CTA, allocated at least ten percent of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity
option premiums and any investee pool, other than a major investee pool, allocated at least ten percent of the assets
of the pool offered and the trading principals of major CTAs and the CPOs of major investee pools that have no prior operating
history. Proposed Rule 4.25(c)(3)(iii) would permit CPOs to provide capsule performance in lieu of giving an indication
of adverse performance.

Comment is requested concerning the proposed treatment of CTA and investee pool performance, including the definitions
of major CTA and major investee pools. In particular, commenters may wish to address whether use of a twenty-five percent
of futures margin or commodity premium benchmark as compared to twenty-five percent of total assets adequately reflects
the relative risks of direct futures trading as compared to trading through vehicles which limit the risk of loss to
the initial investment. Comment also is requested as to the definition of adverse performance, in particular, as
to whether any additional benchmarks for identifying whether past performance is sufficiently ``adverse'' to warrant
disclosure would be appropriate. For example, should the adverse performance definition be revised to include a
one-month draw-down exceeding a specified percentage, e.g., twenty-five percent, of account equity traded pursuant
to the trading program under which the CTA will trade for the offered pool.

Concurrently, Rule 4.22(a) is proposed to be revised by adding paragraph (a)(4) to require periodic account statements
to include the names of all of the pool's CTAs and investee pools regardless of the amount of pool assets allocated to
them. In addition, to provide a ready means of presenting the performance of newly added major CTAs and investee pools,
account statements would be required to include the past performance of all CTAs and investee pools that are major
CTAs and major investee pools as of the date of the statements and whose performance was not previously disclosed.
Use of account statements to update major CTAs' and investee pools' performance records would provide a convenient
means for CPOs to amend pool performance disclosures. In the event that the pool acquired a new major CTA or investee
pool whose past performance had not previously been disclosed, the CPO would be required to notify pool participants
of such event and provide the relevant performance records as required by proposed Rule 4.26(c) (current Rule 4.21(b)),

Current Rule 4.21 generally requires past performance to be presented for a three-year period. However, the Commission
is aware that some registrants nonetheless include longer performance periods in their disclosure documents for
marketing purposes. The Commission believes that requiring performance to be disclosed for a period longer than
three years will have the benefit of making performance disclosures more uniform and will provide a better picture
of the evolution of performance over time, including positive and negative fluctuations in returns. In addition,
under the proposed summary format for performance disclosure, lengthy tables to present performance data would
not be required. Consequently, adoption of a five-year disclosure period would not result in any significant increase
in the volume of performance disclosures. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to increase the minimum time
period for which performance would be disclosed from three to five years. CPOs may continue to provide additional
performance disclosures provided the performance is calculated in compliance with proposed Rule 4.25 and is included
in the document following the required performance disclosures as required by proposed Rule 4.24(v) for information
voluntarily provided.

7. Composite Performance Presentations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Rule 4.21(a)(4)(iv) currently permits the performance of pools operated by each person for whom performance is required
to be disclosed to be presented on a composite basis provided that the performance of the pool offered is separately
disclosed, the CPO describes how each composite was developed, and the composite is not misleading. Rule 4.31 also
permits composite presentation of the performance of accounts directed by the CTA and each of its principals provided
that material differences among the accounts and the manner in which the composite was developed are described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Composite presentations have the obvious advantage of reducing the volume of past performance data presented. However,
composite presentations raise a number of regulatory concerns precisely because they supplant individualized
presentations of potentially quite different types of pools and trading programs and may smooth or camouflage actual
rates of return. Composite results not only fail to reflect differences among the pools and accounts whose results
are presented but also merge potentially disparate trading results into average trading results and thus fail to
reflect the actual dispersion of returns as well as the volatility of individual pools and accounts. For these reasons,
the Commission considered prohibiting the use of composite performance data for pools as well as accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has carefully considered the benefits and disadvantages that may accrue from the use of composites
and is proposing an approach designed to realize the benefits of reducing the volume of performance data created by
the use of composites while reducing the potential for misleading result presentations. Under the proposal, past
performance data for the pool offered and pools similar to the pool offered would be required to be separately disclosed.
Pools of a different type from the pool offered would be permitted to be presented in composites with other pools of
the same type, provided that such presentations would not be misleading. Pools would be considered to be of a different
type or category if they differed in material respects. The proposed rule delineates several types of material distinctions
among pools for this purpose, including the following: Pools privately offered pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities
Act and public pools; pools traded with materially different leverages; limited risk pools and non-limited risk
pools; pools using different commodity or trading methodologies; and multi-advisor pools
<FOOTCITE>
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
</FOOTCITE>
 and non-multi-advisor pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Rule 4.10(h) would define the term ``multi-advisor pool'' as a pool in which no CTA is allocated twenty-five
percent or more of the pool's aggregate initial margin and premiums for futures and commodity option contracts and
no investee pool is allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A pool could be included in a composite with another pool only if both pools were of the same type with respect to each
of these categories. For example, a publicly offered non-multi-advisor pool could not be included in the same composite
as a privately offered non-multi-advisor pool and two limited risk pools that used different trading programs or
materially different degrees of leverage could not be included in the same composite. Moreover, there may be instances
in which even composites of pools of the same type may be misleading, such as where differences between the trading
results of the pools are so great that a composite would materially distort their results. For example, two publicly
offered multi-advisor pools with the same CTAs could show widely disparate results unless each CTA were allocated
substantially the same portion of each pool's assets. Also, two single-advisor pools with different CTAs may achieve
very different results. The proviso in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii) that results may be presented in composite form
``unless such presentation would be misleading'' is intended to assure that composites are carefully reviewed to
protect against any material distortion that may result from these types of situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rules 4.25(a)(6) and 4.34(a)(2) would require that records substantiating the performance data set forth
in CPO and CTA documents, respectively, and documenting the underlying calculations be maintained in accordance
with Rule 1.31. Naturally, this requirement also applies with respect to composite presentations. Pursuant to proposed
Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii), a CPO must be prepared to justify the inclusion in a composite of the pool results contained therein.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To present capsule performance of pools in a composite, the CPO would name all pools included in the composite, set
forth the categories of these pools (which, as discussed above, would be the same for each pool in the composite), including
at a minimum the categories specified in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(iii), and specify the dates on which each pool commenced
trading. The aggregate gross capital subscriptions would be the total subscriptions for all pools in the composite.
The draw-down figures would be the worst experienced by any one of the pools included in the composite and the rate of
return would be the average rate of return for all pools included. The sample capsule past performance presentation
table set forth above following the discussion on capsule performance includes an example of performance presentation
for pools (pools A and B, in the example) whose performance is disclosed in composite form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment as to whether the pool categories delineated in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(iii) relating
to composite presentations are appropriate for purposes of limiting composite presentations and as to whether any
additional categories of pools should be identified for this purpose. Comment is also requested as to the costs and
benefits of a general requirement of separate rather than composite presentation of pool performance in lieu of a
qualified approach of the nature proposed.

Proposed Rule 4.34(a)(5) would permit CTAs to include in a composite all accounts traded pursuant to the same trading
program, provided that such a presentation would not be misleading and provided that the CTA describes how the composite
was calculated. The term ``trading program'' would be defined in the rule as ``a trading strategy differentiated
from others by commodity trading methodology, degree of risk or degree of leverage.'' Comment is requested as to the
necessity and feasibility of providing a more detailed definition of the term ``trading program'' or additional
guidance as to how trading programs can be differentiated.

8. Proprietary Trading Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of proprietary trading results in soliciting customer accounts is a practice which has long been of concern to
the Commission. CPOs and CTAs may trade proprietary funds for a variety of purposes, including to test a new trading
strategy before implementing it for customer funds or to establish a track record prior to trading customer funds.
However, proprietary accounts may be traded in a different manner, for example, more aggressively, using higher
leverage and assuming greater risk, than customer accounts. Also, proprietary accounts are usually not subject
to the same fee schedule as customer accounts. Naturally, no management or incentive fee would apply where a CTA traded
its own account, and clearing fees may be waived or reduced if the account is cleared by an affiliate. In addition, where
proprietary and customer assets are combined for purposes of performance presentations, the total amount of assets
under management is inflated and conceals the actual amount of customer funds being traded. For these reasons, proprietary
trading results may, in many cases, be of little relevance to a prospective pool participant or CTA client and actually
misleading in others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Commission's rules do not specifically address the use of proprietary trading results in disclosure
documents. However, in reviewing disclosure documents, because the rules require performance of ``directed accounts''
and because of the prohibition against misleading disclosures, Division staff have advised that any proprietary
trading results provided must be clearly labeled as such and presented in a separate table to reduce the potential
for misleading investors. The staff also has required that if fees, expenses, commissions, margin-to-equity ratios,
or any other item pertaining to the proprietary trading is materially different from that relevant to the trading
program offered to clients, the registrant must ``pro forma'' such items to correspond to those in the program offered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the Part 4 rules, the Commission considered prohibiting the use of proprietary results in CPO and CTA
disclosure documents given the potentially misleading nature of such presentations and their at best marginal relevance
in the non-proprietary trading context. However, the Commission is aware that proprietary trading results may be
the only performance results available to some new traders to present to customers as evidence of trading experience.
Accordingly, rather than prohibiting disclosure of proprietary trading results, the Commission is proposing to
permit such disclosure under appropriate restrictions. Under proposed Rule 4.25(a)(9), pools and accounts in which
the pool operator, trading manager, CTA or other person providing services to the pool owned or controlled fifty percent
or more of the beneficial interest could not be included in disclosure documents unless prominently labeled as such
and set forth following all required performance and non-performance disclosures. The requirement that proprietary
results follow all required disclosures, rather than just the required performance disclosures, would reflect
the peripheral and potentially misleading nature of proprietary trading results and reduce the potential for confusion
of proprietary and customer trading results.

The NFA Special Committee also reached the conclusion that proprietary results should be displayed separately and
labeled as such and that adjustments for fee differentials and other differences should be made.

9. Pro Forma, Hypothetical and Extracted Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also recognizes the potential for inappropriate use of certain other types of performance data. These
include hypothetical, pro forma and extracted results. Hypothetical results are results calculated based upon
the application of a given program to historical market prices and purport to present results that could have been
obtained in trading a particular program during the specified historical period. Thus, hypothetical results are
based on hindsight and can be readily manipulated. Rule 4.41 requires that any presentation of simulated or hypothetical
trading results be accompanied by a specified cautionary statement describing the limited value of such results.
In its rule submission, the NFA notes that a number of NFA disciplinary cases have involved NFA members who advertise
hypothetical results to solicit unsophisticated customers. When the trading program is unsuccessful and causes
substantial customer losses, the program is abandoned in favor of a new program for which hypothetical results, based
on hindsight, are presented. The actual performance of customers whose accounts were traded under the prior program
may never be disclosed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pro forma results present trading results with adjustments to reflect certain factors, such as a particular fee schedule
or degree of leverage, to permit easier comparison with other types of results. In its rule submission, the NFA notes
that in some instances the use of pro forma results may have some of the same limitations as hypothetical results. For
example, some CPOs may use pro forma data to present results that a multi-advisor pool could have achieved had assets
been allocated differently among CTAs than occurred in actuality. As the NFA Special Committee concluded, ``[t]his
use of pro forma results reflects the same sort of hindsight that hypothetical results do and invites the same sort
of abuse.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extracted performance results isolate a single component of a trading strategy for presentation to customers, and
although based on actual results, are subject to manipulation as they may disproportionately emphasize a small portion
of the overall strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Commission believes that the use of pro forma, hypothetical and extracted results must be closely scrutinized,
it has determined not to prohibit them at the present time. Instead, like other disclosures voluntarily provided,
the disclosure of these types of results would be subject to such restrictions as may be imposed under the rules of a
registered futures association and to the Commission's general antifraud prohibitions. NFA's proposed Compliance
Rule 2&hyph;29(c) would strictly limit the use of hypothetical results in promotional material, except in promotional
material directed exclusively to qualified eligible participants, as defined in CFTC Rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii). NFA's
proposed interpretation of Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 would permit pro forma performance histories solely for the
purpose of adjusting performance presentations to the same fee structure as that of the pool or program offered. No
pro forma results which reflect a hindsight analysis, such as to show results a multi-advisor pool could have achieved
using a different allocation of assets among CTAs, would be permitted. Extracted results would only be permitted
to be presented based on the percentage of net asset value actually committed to the particular component extracted.

10. Voluntary Performance Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to proposed Rule 4.24(v), disclosures, including performance disclosures, other than those required
by CFTC rules must follow all relevant required disclosures in the disclosure document
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 and may not be misleading in their content or presentation or inconsistent with required disclosures.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 Performance disclosures voluntarily provided could have misleading effects if favorable performance data are
given undue prominence. For example, if the performance of two pools other than the offered pool operated by the CPO
were voluntarily provided, it may be misleading to show the favorable performance of Pool 1 but not the negative performance
of Pool 2 or to show the performance of Pool 1 in capsule format and that of Pool 2 in full format. It may also be misleading
to show the performance of a pool in capsule format for year one and in full format for year two or to show the pool's performance
for 1991 and not 1992. Generally, inclusion of voluntarily provided performance data should be made on a result-neutral
basis that results in inclusion of all similar data. For example, the past performance of two CTAs allocated an equal
portion of a pool's assets should either be included or omitted, as should the performance of the CPO's other pools.

The Commission also notes that the practice of advertising the performance of a particular CTA with an excellent track
record to attract prospective participants and shortly thereafter reallocating pool assets to another CTA, a practice
commonly referred to as ``bait-and-switch,'' is misleading and that performance voluntarily provided for this
purpose is prohibited under general antifraud standards.

11. Cautionary Legends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules would continue to require the inclusion of certain legends alerting pool participants and prospective
participants to the lack of experience of the CPO (or trading manager), the pool's CTAs and their principals. However,
these legends have been revised and substantially streamlined. Under current Rule 4.21, these legends are required
to recite the relevant performance disclosure requirement. For example, Rule 4.21(4)(i)(B) requires a statement
that the CFTC requires disclosure of the performance of the pool offered and of other pools operated by the CPO and its
principals and that neither the CPO nor its principals have any prior performance history.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rules would eliminate the prescribed statements concerning CFTC rules, with the effect of deleting
the bulk of the bold-faced disclosures and of focusing attention upon the primary point to be conveyed, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the fact that the CPO and its principals have not previously operated any commodity pools. Thus, the legend relating
to the lack of trading history of a pool would read: ``THIS POOL HAS NOT COMMENCED TRADING AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY PERFORMANCE
HISTORY'',
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 and the legend relating to the lack of experience of the CPO and its trading principals would read: ``NEITHER THIS POOL
OPERATOR NOR ANY OF ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAS PREVIOUSLY OPERATED ANY OTHER POOLS OR TRADED ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS.''
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 Similar legends would be required, where applicable, with respect to trading managers and major investee pools.
To further reduce the bulk of these disclosures, where several legends may be required, the proposed rules provide
an alternate legend consolidating the several statements that would otherwise be required. For example, the proposed
rules would require a CTA disclosure document to disclose, if true, the lack of experience of the CTA and its principals.
If the CTA had no prior experience, the following legend should be included: ``THIS TRADING ADVISOR PREVIOUSLY HAS
NOT DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' The following legend would be used for trading principals: ``NONE OF THE TRADING PRINCIPALS
OF THIS TRADING ADVISOR HAS PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' If neither the CTA nor any of its principals had prior
trading experience, rather than displaying these two separate legends, the following single sentence would be included:
``NEITHER THIS TRADING ADVISOR NOR ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAVE PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' These proposals
are designed to reduce disclosures that complicate and lengthen disclosure documents while preserving disclosures
that may be important to prospective investors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For pools with an operating history shorter than three years, the performance of the pool offered would be required
to be the first performance record presented in the disclosure document. Performance data for pools of the same category
as the pool offered would be required to appear after the performance history of the pool offered and to be presented
on a pool-by-pool, that is non-composite, basis. Pools of a different category from the pool offered would be required
to follow the performance of pools of the same category as the pool offered. As discussed above, for purposes of applying
the requirement that composite presentations be used only for pools of the same category, the rule would identify
a number of categories of pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the streamlined past performance disclosure requirements should substantially increase
the clarity and readability of past performance disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of Rule 4.25 and, in particular, on the adequacy of the summary performance
format to provide a basis upon which a prospective pool participant may make an informed judgment with respect to past
performance results; whether a three-year history is a sufficient basis for eliminating any requirement for disclosure
of past performance other than that of the pool offered; and whether the ten percent allocation thresholds for major
CTAs and investee pools, below which no performance disclosures would be required, is appropriate. The Commission
also requests comment as to whether past performance presentations would provide more meaningful information if
they were required to include rates of return on a risk-adjusted basis, that is, reduced by the relevant Treasury Bill
rate or comparable interest figure, or to break out trading results from passive interest income.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, a primary objective of this proposal is to foster clarity and comprehensibility in the disclosure
of relevant information to prospective pool participants. To this end, in addition to eliminating certain required
disclosures, the Commission is proposing that certain information be presented in a required sequence which would
be specified in proposed Rules 4.24(a) through (d). Like current Rule 4.21, proposed Rule 4.24 would require that
a cautionary statement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a statement that the CFTC has not passed upon the merits of the pool investment or the adequacy of the disclosure document,
and any other information required under any other applicable federal or state laws and regulations, appear on the
cover page of the disclosure document. The risk disclosure statement specified in Rule 4.24(b) would be required
to be set forth immediately after these disclosures. The next item in the disclosure document would be a table of contents.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 Prior to any detailed disclosures with respect to the pool and persons involved in operating and trading the assets
of the pool, in what would constitute the ``forepart'' of the disclosure document, a prospective participant would
find very basic information concerning the pool.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 This information would include the name and address of the pool and CPO; the type of pool being offered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
whether the pool is privately offered pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, a multi-advisor pool
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
, or a limited risk pool
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
; a statement whether the pool is continuously offered or the closing date of the offering; the date of the disclosure
document; and the ``break-even point'' for the pool, that is, the trading profit that the pool must realize in its first
year for a participant to recoup its initial investment. The break-even point would provide a simple illustration
of the costs of investing in the pool and facilitate comparisons among pools.

Rule 4.21 currently does not require a table of contents. However, most disclosure documents reviewed by the Division
contain such a table. Further, Form S&hyph;1, the form most frequently used to register pool offerings with the SEC,
requires ``a reasonably detailed table of contents showing the subject matter of the various sections or subdivisions
of the prospectus and the page number on which each section or subdivision begins.'' See Item 502(g) of Regulation
S&hyph;K, 17 CFR 229.502(g), incorporated by reference into Item 2 of Form S&hyph;1, 17 CFR 239.11. The Commission
believes that a table of contents should contribute to making the disclosure document ``user-friendly''.

discussed above at this time. However, the Commission requests comment on the appropriateness and desirability
of mandating that all required information be presented in a specified order to foster clarity in and comparability
of disclosure documents, ease of regulatory review, and development of compliance guidance or instructions.

2. Voluntary Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address concerns that in many cases the disclosure process fails to achieve its intended purpose due to the high
volume of information included in the disclosure document, the Commission is proposing a format for disclosure documents
under which ``voluntary'' disclosures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, those not required by Commission rules
<FOOTCITE>
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
48
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
</FOOTCITE>
 or those of other regulators, would be required to be placed in the disclosure document after all relevant required
disclosures. Proposed Rule 4.24(v) would require all information, other than that required by the Commission, the
antifraud provisions of the Act, and any federal or state securities laws and regulations, to appear following the
related required disclosures. Such ``voluntary information'' could not be misleading in content or presentation
or inconsistent with required disclosures. In addition, voluntary information would be subject to the antifraud
provisions of the Act and the regulations thereunder and to rules regarding the use of promotional material promulgated
by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act. This format is designed to accommodate the
apparent desire of some CPOs and CTAs to include in disclosure documents information that is not required under the
Commission's rules or those of other regulators, while assuring that core disclosures are given due prominence.
Naturally, CPOs and CTAs would continue to be subject to the antifraud prohibitions of sections 4b and 4

3. Investee Pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed disclosure framework specifically addresses disclosures concerning investee pools. As discussed
in the performance section, for purposes of past performance disclosures, investee pools would be treated comparably
to CTAs, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the scope of performance disclosure required would be based on the amount of assets of the offered pool committed
to the investee pool. However, a different benchmark for applying the twenty-five percent (as used in the major investee
pool definition) and ten percent (for adverse performance disclosure to be required) thresholds is used for investee
pools in light of the fact that investments in other pools generally expose the pool only to loss of the initial investment
and that the full amount of the investment is required to be paid at the inception of the investment. The relative importance
of investee pools to prospective pool participants is thus more appropriately determined by reference to the proportion
of the pool's total assets invested in the investee pool. The proposal would streamline other investee pool disclosures
to obviate the need for CPOs to substantially incorporate in the document the contents of each investee pool's disclosure
document.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-performance disclosure requirements relating to investee pools also would be tailored to take into account
the relative importance of the investee pool to the offered pool, as measured by the amount of assets of the pool offered
allocated to it. Thus, no disclosures would be required for investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the assets
of the pool offered and disclosures with respect to other investee pools would be limited based on the proportion of
the pool's assets allocated to them. Specifically, with respect to each investee pool allocated at least ten percent
of the assets of the pool offered, the CPO also would be required to disclose its name and that of its CPO and its principals
and any conflicts of interest on the part of the investee pool's CPO in respect of the offered pool.

, those allocated twenty-five percent or more of the assets of the offered pool, the CPO would be required to disclose
the business background of, material litigation against, and any ownership in the pool offered on the part of its CPO
and its principals. In addition, the use of proceeds, risk factors, fees and expense, and redemption sections of the
document would call for specific information relative to investments in investee pools. Risk disclosure relative
to investee pools would be required because investments in investee pools may create both the risks inherent in the
investee pool's own investments and liquidity risks due to restrictions upon redemption of the investment in the
investee pool. Fees and expenses may accrue at each level of a multi-tier structure and should be disclosed. Investments
in investee pools with redemption periods different from those of the pool offered or with minimum ``lock-in'' provisions

The Commission requests comment concerning the proposed treatment of investee pools. In particular, commenters
are invited to address any special public policy or disclosure considerations presented by tiered investment structures
by means of which a commodity pool can, in effect, appropriate the value of a second fund's management by investing
all or a portion of its funds in the second fund. The Commission also requests comment concerning whether any additional
protections, other than disclosure of applicable fees, are appropriate in light of the ``layering'' of fees that
typically occurs at each level of a fund of funds structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Risk Disclosure Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 4.21 currently requires that disclosure documents include a prescribed bold-face statement alerting prospective
pool participants to the risks involved in participating in a pool. This statement does not specifically address
the risks of trading foreign futures or foreign option contracts. The risks attributable to foreign futures and foreign
options were originally required to be addressed by a special disclosure statement, set forth in part 30 of the Commission's
regulations, which generally governs transactions in foreign futures and foreign options.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, a CPO offering a pool expected to trade foreign and domestic futures or options was required to include in the
disclosure document the Rule 4.21 risk disclosure statement, which does not refer to foreign futures or options,
and the Rule 30.6 foreign futures and options risk disclosure statement. However, Rule 1.55, the basic risk disclosure
requirement applicable to FCMs and IBs opening accounts for domestic futures and option contracts, was recently
amended to consolidate the required disclosures concerning foreign futures and options into the domestic risk disclosure
statement, and the separate Rule 30.6(a) disclosure statement was eliminated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Consequently, under the revised Rules 1.55 and 30.6, CPOs and CTAs offering pools and accounts, respectively, which
may engage in foreign futures and option transactions would be required to include the new consolidated Rule 1.55
risk disclosure statement as well as the part 4 risk disclosure statement in the disclosure document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to address the potential for duplicative disclosure created by the recent rule revisions
and to eliminate the necessity for providing two prescribed risk disclosure statements by revising the part 4 risk
disclosure statements for CPOs and CTAs to address the risks of foreign as well as domestic transactions. Rule 30.6(b)
would be revised to cross-reference the part 4 statement. In addition, the terms ``domestic'' and ``foreign'' previously
used to refer to contract markets or exchanges in foreign jurisdictions are proposed to be replaced with the terms
``United States'' and ``non-United States'' to avoid confusion in the context of offerings in non-United States
jurisdictions to non-United States participants for whom the term ``foreign'' does not mean ``non-United States''.

5. Business Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 4.21(a)(2) currently requires disclosure of the business backgrounds of the pool's CPO and CTA, and their principals.
This disclosure requirement would be streamlined by: (1) Eliminating the requirement to disclose business backgrounds
of CTAs except those of major CTAs, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the fund's futures margins and commodity option premiums; and (2)
limiting the requirement to disclose business backgrounds of principals

 Comment is requested as to whether the business backgrounds of all principals, even those who hold a passive ownership
interest in the CPO, should continue to be required to be disclosed. The business backgrounds of trading managers,
who represent a subset of CTAs, and their principals who participate in making trading or operational decisions or
supervise persons so engaged would also be required to be disclosed.

6. Principal Risk Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, current Rule 4.21(a)(17)(ii) requires the inclusion, at the front of the disclosure document, of
a ``boiler-plate'' risk disclosure statement that describes generically the risks of pool investments. Proposed
Rule 4.24(g) would require, in addition to this required disclosure, a discussion designed to address risk factors
specific to the pool offered. This discussion would address the volatility of the pool investment as compared to investments
in other types of trading vehicles and other risks relating to the particular trading program to be followed, such
as risks resulting from concentration of investments in particular commodities or contracts or from trading foreign
contracts that are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Risks relative to transactions in off-exchange instruments,
e.g., counterparty creditworthiness risks,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
57
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or to the lack of relevant experience of the CPO or CTAs should also be addressed. The Commission believes that a succinct
``plain English'' discussion of the risks of the investment being offered would be highly material to the prospective
participant's evaluation of the proposed investment and that this type of disclosure warrants particular attention
when complex over-the-counter transactions are contemplated. Establishment of an express requirement for disclosure
of principal risk factors essentially codifies disclosures that would likely be required under the specific requirements
of existing rules or as material information.

These risks may differ materially from those entailed in exchange-traded futures and option transactions, which
are backed by clearing organization guarantees, daily marking-to-market and settlement, and segregation and minimum
capital requirements applicable to intermediaries. Transactions entered directly between two counterparties
generally do not benefit from such protections and expose the parties to the risk of counterparty default.

Under current Rule 4.21(a)(1)(viii), the pool operator must describe the types of commodity interests that the pool
is expected to trade and any restrictions or limitations on such trading established by the CPO. Current Rule 4.21(a)(9)
requires a description of the manner in which the pool will fulfill its margin requirements and of the form in which
non-margin funds will be held. The nature of non-cash items must be described and the person to whom any income generated
by such items will be paid must be identified. Taken together, Rules 4.21(a)(1)(viii) and (a)(9) call for information
concerning all types of trading and investments in which the pool is expected to engage. As a result, under current
rules, CPOs generally provide a description of the overall trading activities of the pool, such that the full range
of transactions, whether in securities, commodity interests or other types of interests, is disclosed.

 to include not only transactions in commodity interests but also any other types of interests in which the pool is expected
to trade. With respect to pool funds that are not deposited as margin or held in cash or cash equivalents, the proposed
rule would require disclosure of the nature of such property, for example, whether it consists of securities listed
on a national securities exchange, bonds, commercial paper or interests in commodity pools, whether such property
is subject to state or federal regulation or to regulation by a foreign government, and any investment rating applicable
to such property. The proposed rule also would require the CPO to indicate the type of custodian,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bank, broker-dealer or other entity, which will hold property not deposited as margin or option premiums and the jurisdiction

provide a more coherent statement of the matters called for by current requirements in a manner that is consistent
with current practice.

8. Fees and Expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 4.21(a)(7) currently requires a description of the expenses that the CPO knows or should know have been incurred
in the past year or will be incurred in the current year. Expenses required to be disclosed include, without limitation,
fees for management, trading advice, brokerage commissions, legal advice, accounting and organizational services.
Rule 4.21(a)(14) requires disclosure of fees and commissions paid in connection with solicitations for the pool.
Proposed new Rule 4.24(i) would combine the requirements of Rule 4.21 (a)(7) and (a)(14) to provide in a single section
of the disclosure document a complete discussion of costs incurred by the pool for all purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provision relating to fees and expenses (Rule 4.24(i)) requires a detailed description of fees and expenses,
including certain fees and expenses that are not specifically enumerated in current Rule 4.21 but that constitute
material disclosures and are thus required to be disclosed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
61
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, clearance fees and fees paid to national exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, incentive fees, including
any disproportionate share of profits allocated to the CPO, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a right of the CPO to receive a greater than pro-rata share of the pool's profits, and fees and expenses incurred as a
result of investments in investee pools and other investment vehicles or to fund the guarantee of a limited risk pool,
would be required to be set forth specifically in the table. In addition, the proposed rule would clarify that disclosure
of fees paid in connection with solicitations for the pool must include trailing commissions as well as any type of
benefit that may accrue to persons engaged in such solicitations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Expenses, fees and commissions are assessed based on various factors. For example, brokerage fees are assessed based
on a round-turn commission, management fees may be based on the net asset value of the pool's assets, incentive fees
on trading profits, and sales commissions may be charged as a percentage of the proceeds of the offering. A description
of each separate fee and expense may not, however, convey a clear understanding of the actual portion of each pool participation
absorbed by fees and expenses. As the risk disclosure statement required by current Rule 4.21(a)(17) indicates,
``in some cases, commodity pools are subject to substantial charges for management, advisory and brokerage fees,''
and ``it may be necessary for those pools that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid
depletion or exhaustion of their assets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To foster a better understanding of the nature of those costs and their impact upon the investment, the proposal would
require, in addition to a narrative description, a tabular presentation of fees and expenses from all sources setting
forth how the break-even point for the pool is calculated (``break-even analysis''). As noted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the ``break-even point'' for the pool, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the trading profit that a pool or trading program must realize in its first year to equal all fees and expenses such that
a participant or client will recoup its initial investment,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
62
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be required to be set forth as a single figure in the forepart of the pool disclosure document, expressed as a percentage
of a unit of initial investment. The break-even analysis would provide an explanation, in tabular form, of how the
break-even point is calculated, taking into account all fees, expenses and commissions applicable to the pool. The
proposal would require the break-even analysis to be prepared in accordance with rules promulgated by a registered
futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act. As noted above, NFA has filed with the Commission a proposed
interpretation of Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 which would set forth how a break-even point must be calculated and the
format in which such calculation must be disclosed.

 The Commission believes that these proposed requirements with respect to fees and expenses will serve to better codify
disclosures required under existing rules and assist readers of disclosure documents in understanding the nature
and effect upon investment returns of costs incidental to the offering and operation of the pool. The Commission requests
comment as to whether a description of fees and expenses should continue to be required or whether the break-even analysis
is sufficient to accurately describe the costs of participation in a pool.

As set forth in NFA's proposed interpretation of Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13, to calculate the break-even point, the
CPO would determine, per unit of participation, the amount of fees and expenses expected to be incurred by the pool
during its first year of operation and subtract from that amount the amount of interest income expected to be earned
by the pool in its first year, to obtain the pool's gross trading profit necessary for the pool to retain its initial
net asset value per unit. The CPO would then determine the amount of additional trading profits necessary to offset
the incentive fees which the CPO would charge for managing the pool. Finally, the CPO would calculate the total amount
of trading income that the pool must earn to equal the initial selling price per unit after one year. This calculation
would be required to be presented in tabular form.

9. Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to current Rule 4.21(a)(3), a description of any actual or potential conflict of interest regarding the
pool on the part of the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals must be included in the disclosure document. This discussion
must include a description of any arrangement whereby the CPO, CTA or their principals may benefit from the maintenance
of the pool account with the FCM or from its introduction to an FCM by an IB. Like current Rule 4.21(a)(3), proposed Rule
4.24(j) would require disclosure of any conflict of interest on the part of the pool's CPO and its principals. Subject
to the requirement that all material information be disclosed, the proposal would eliminate such disclosure with
respect to CTAs allocated less than ten percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee
pools allocated less than ten percent of the pool's assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule also would require disclosure of conflicts of interest with respect to any persons providing services
to the pool or soliciting participants for the pool. This provision would encompass certain categories of Commission
registrants specified in the existing rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FCMs and IBs, as well as any other person providing services to the pool.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
65
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that the purposes of conflict of interest disclosure are not limited to situations where
such conflicts relate to a Commission registrant and that there may be unregulated parties, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a CPO affiliate acting as counterparty to over-the-counter transactions with the pool, as to whom such disclosure
may be equally material. Consequently, the Commission proposes to delete the specific reference in the current rule
to the pool's FCM and IB and their principals and to substitute more general terminology intended to include but not
to be limited to FCMs and IBs. Although the express requirement of disclosure of conflicts of interest on the part of
FCM and IB principals would be eliminated, disclosure of such conflicts may be required as material information in
specific situations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, where an FCM's majority owner or other controlling person has such a conflict in regard to the pool.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the general materiality standard, disclosure of conflicts of interest on the part of CTAs and CPOs of investee
pools below the ten percent thresholds would be required if, in light of all relevant circumstances, including, for
example, the nature and severity of the conflict, such disclosure would be material to prospective pool participants.

In addition, the current provision requiring the description of carrying broker or introducing arrangements benefitting
the CPO or CTA and their principals has been revised to make clear that payments for order flow and soft dollar arrangements
must be included. Payment for order flow is a practice whereby FCMs and IBs compensate CPOs and CTAs for directing customers
to them. Soft dollar arrangements consist of arrangements whereby customer or pool funds are used to pay for research
or other services that benefit the CPO or CTA. Both practices have been of concern to regulators because, among other
things, they are often inadequately disclosed.

Separately, under proposed Rule 4.24(k) (``Related Party Transactions''), any material transactions or arrangements
for which there is no publicly disseminated price between the pool and any person affiliated with a person providing
services to the pool, would be required to be disclosed, including the costs of such transactions to the pool.

 The Commission believes that this type of disclosure may be viewed as already required in many cases under the general
requirement that material information be disclosed. However, given the increasing use of over-the-counter transactions
in which pools contract with the pool operator or an affiliate of the pool operator, an express requirement for such
disclosure appears warranted.

CPO of, among other pools, Compass Futures Fund (``Compass'') and Advanced Portfolio Management, Limited Partnership
(``Advanced''). The Commission's complaint included allegations that in December 1989, Compass used pool funds
in the amount of approximately $4,550,000 (about 80% of its assets) to purchase commercial paper issued by Stotler
Group and that Advanced used pool funds in the amount of approximately $1 million (about 10% of its assets) to make a
loan to Stotler Group. The disclosure documents of Compass and Advanced did not disclose such uses of pool funds. The
limited partnership agreement for Compass specifically precluded the use of pool funds to make loans.

10. Litigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Rule 4.21(a)(13) requires disclosure of any material administrative, civil or criminal action within the
five years preceding the date of the disclosure document against the CPO, CTA(s), FCM, IB and their principals. Like
the current rule, proposed Rule 4.24(1) would require the disclosure of administrative, civil or criminal actions
against certain persons involved in operating or trading the pool during the five years preceding the date of the disclosure
document. However, this requirement would be substantially simplified. Concluded actions that resulted in an adjudication
on the merits in favor of such persons would not be required to be disclosed. In addition, disclosure of the litigation
background of FCMs and IBs would be limited as follows. First, with respect to litigation brought by private parties,
the proposed rule would provide for the materiality of the action to be determined by reference to the potential financial
impact upon the FCM or IB. Specifically, an action would be considered material if it would be required to be disclosed
in the notes to the registrant's financial statements prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles
(``GAAP''). Generally, under GAAP, certain information regarding litigation must be disclosed if the potential
of a financial loss from the litigation is either probable (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, likely to occur) or reasonably possible (more than remote but less than likely).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
68
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except for events occurring subsequent to the issuance of the latest certified financial statements, under this
paragraph, litigation required to be disclosed would already have been disclosed in the FCM's or IB's latest certified
financial statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the requirement to disclose actions brought by the Commission and other regulatory agencies against FCMs
and IBs would be streamlined. Actions brought by the Commission would be treated differently from those brought by
other regulatory agencies due to the presumptively greater significance of such actions to an investment decision.
All actions brought by the Commission would be considered material other than concluded actions which did not result
in fines exceeding $50,000 and did not involve allegations of fraud or other willful misconduct. Actions brought
by any other federal or state agency or by a self-regulatory organization, whether domestic or foreign, would be considered
material if they involved allegations of fraud or other willful misconduct.

In addition, the proposed rule would eliminate the requirement to disclose litigation against CTAs allocated less
than twenty-five percent of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and the principals
of FCMs and IBs. Of course, as noted above with respect to conflicts of interest on the part of FCM and IB principals,
the requirement to disclose all material information may require such disclosure in particular cases. Proposed
Rule 4.24(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) also requires disclosure of litigation against a pool's trading manager, if any, and its principals, a requirement
which is encompassed within the existing requirement for disclosure of litigation against CTAs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Limited Risk Pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
So-called ``guaranteed pools,'' which generally are designed to assure participants the return of their initial
investment, have been extensively offered in recent years. Such pools generally commit a significant portion of
their assets to interest-bearing instruments, letters of credit or other investments to fund the ``guarantee''
and correspondingly reduce the level of their futures or other investments. Many ``guarantee'' structures require
that the participant maintain his investment in the fund for a specified period of years in order to realize on the guarantee.
Because such structures impose significant costs which limit the potential for futures and other investment-related
returns, are often subject to significant conditions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that redemption rights not be exercised for a specified period of years from the date of the initial investment, and
are subject to varying degrees of risk of nonfulfillment due to unforeseen trading losses or other reasons, the use
of ``guarantee'' terminology in pool disclosure documents raises certain regulatory concerns. These concerns
relate to such matters as the representations expressly or impliedly made as to the nature and security of the pool
investment and the impact of the guarantee structure upon the overall investment. In Advisory 86&hyph;1
<FOOTCITE>
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
70
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
</FOOTCITE>
, the Division of Trading and Markets set forth certain disclosures that should be made in this context to assure that
prospective investors are apprised of material information concerning guarantee structures. These include, for
example, statements that a specified percentage of each unit of participation in the pool has been set aside to purchase
the guarantee, that redemptions are not available for a specified period and that additional expenses and management
fees are charged in connection with the guarantee, as applicable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) would codify minimum disclosures relevant to limited risk pools. Under the proposal, the term ``limited risk pool''
would be defined in Rule 4.10(i) to mean ``a pool&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;that is designed to limit the loss
of the initial investment of its participants.'' Rule 4.24(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) would generally codify Advisory 86&hyph;1 by requiring the CPO of a limited risk pool to describe the nature of the
limitation on risk intended to be provided, the manner in which the limitation is achieved, including the cost of providing
it, the conditions that must be satisfied for participants to receive the benefits of the risk limitation and the circumstances
in which the risk limitation becomes operative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CPOs are also reminded of the admonition in Advisory 86&hyph;1 that ``(a)ny statements that suggest that the risks
of futures trading are decreased by reason of this structure have a high potential to mislead or deceive and could result
in serious violations of the Commission's regulations and anti-fraud provisions.''

12. Other Proposed Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Rule 4.21 requires certain negative statements to be made in a pool disclosure document where there is no pertinent
information to report. A CPO must state, if true, that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest regarding
any aspect of the pool on the part of certain persons, that certain persons do not own any beneficial interest in the
pool, that no material litigation occurred within the past five years against the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals,
and that the CPO, CTA, and their principals will not trade for their own accounts. These negative statements would
no longer be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 4.21 would permit CPOs to provide prospective participants who are accredited investors as defined
in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act

C. Section 4.26_Use, Amendment and Filing of Disclosure Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as follows, the requirements for updating pool disclosure documents would remain substantially unchanged
and are proposed to be set forth in Rule 4.26. The Commission is proposing to extend from six to nine months the maximum
period between the date on a disclosure document and the date of its use. This would conform the updating requirements
of pool disclosure documents to those of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act for public securities offerings.

 As under current Rule 4.21(b), two copies of each amendment to the disclosure document must be filed within twenty-one
calendar days of the date upon which the pool operator first knows or has reason to know of the defect requiring the amendment.
There has been some uncertainty as to whether amendments are subject to the twenty-one day prefiling requirements
of current Rule 4.21(g)(1) (renumbered as Rule 4.26(d)(1)). The Commission is confirming that such amendments may
be used simultaneously with their filing with the Commission, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules,
consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. The rule amendments discussed herein would affect registered
CPOs and CTAs. The Commission has previously established certain definitions of ``small entities'' to be used by
the Commission in evaluating the impact of its rules on such entities in accordance with the RFA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
74
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission previously determined that registered CPOs are not small entities for the purpose of the RFA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With respect to CTAs, the Commission has stated that it would evaluate within the context of a particular rule proposal
whether all or some affected CTAs would be considered to be small entities and, if so, the economic impact on them of
any rule.

The amendments proposed herein would reduce rather than increase the requirements of Rule 4.21 for CPOs and the requirements
of Rule 4.31 for CTAs. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 3(a) of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Acting Chairman, on behalf
of the Commission, certifies that these proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The Commission nonetheless invites comment from any registered CPO or CTA who believes
that these rules would have a significant impact on its operations.

RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH
TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE
ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN
FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF THE MARKET
MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN
FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED
TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION. THIS CAN OCCUR,
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A ``LIMIT MOVE.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THE PLACEMENT OF CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A ``STOP-LOSS'' OR ``STOP-LIMIT'' ORDER,
WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``SPREAD'' POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE ``LONG'' OR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``SHORT'' POSITION. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS WELL AS FOR YOU. THE
USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES. IT
MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID
DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS, AT PAGE (insert page number), A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR AND A STATEMENT OF THE PERCENTAGE
RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS. YOU SHOULD

AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED

RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS
ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.

General principles.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The performance of the program offered must be displayed first, calculated in accordance with generally accepted

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles as specified below or by a method otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Commission, in a table showing at least quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) The beginning net asset value for the period, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall represent the previous period's ending net asset value; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) All additions, whether voluntary or involuntary, during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) All withdrawals and redemptions, whether voluntary or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involuntary, during the period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) The net performance for the period, which shall represent the change in the net asset value net of additions, withdrawals,
redemptions, fees and expenses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) The ending net asset value for the period, which shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the beginning net asset value plus or minus additions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawals and redemptions, and net performance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vi) The rate of return for the period, computed on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounded monthly basis, which shall be calculated by dividing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the net performance by the beginning net asset value; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The performance of all other programs must be presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as set forth in &sect;4.25(a)(1)(ii)(C) through (G) and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the information set forth in &sect;4.34(a)(1), and calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a current basis. The commodity trading advisor must maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all supporting documents necessary to substantiate such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation in accordance with &sect;1.31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) All performance information presented in the disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document must be current as of a date not more than three months

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) All required performance information must be presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the most recent five calendar years and year-to-date or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its entire duration, if less than five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (5) Unless such presentation would be misleading, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of accounts traded pursuant to the same trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program may be presented in a single composite table provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the trading advisor describes how each composite was calculated. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
trading program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a trading strategy

degree of risk or degree of leverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) The performance of any account in which the commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trading advisor, any of its principals or any person providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services to the pool owns or controls fifty percent or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beneficial interests shall not be included in a disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document unless such performance is prominently labeled as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietary and set forth separately after all required disclosures.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to allow a vessel carrying a shipment of meat or meat-food
products to be cleared before the filing of a copy of an export certificate by providing a statement regarding the shipment
and the export certificate. The copy of the export certificate must then be presented within 4 days of the vessel's
clearance. The regulations are being amended so that they will conform to revised regulations of the Food Safety and
Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In this document, Customs proposes to amend its regulations so that there will be consistency between regulations
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and those of Customs regarding the timeframe within which an exporter
must file a certificate certifying the wholesomeness of meat products being exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), meat and meat products intended and offered for export and sale in a foreign country must be inspected. In addition,
FMIA prohibits the clearance for departure of any vessel carrying meat and meat products for export to and sale in a
foreign country until the owner or shipper has obtained from an inspector a certificate indicating that the products
are sound and wholesome (unless the Secretary has waived certificate requirements for the country). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1986, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the Department of Agriculture, which administers the FMIA,
amended its regulations. Previously, the FSIS regulations required that exporters deliver a duplicate of the export
certificate to the shipper for filing with Customs at the time the master's manifest or supplemental manifest is filed
by the chief officer with Customs; that is, on the day of departure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Otherwise, the vessel carrying the meat or meat products would not be granted clearance. Because &sect;4.75 of the
Customs regulations allows shippers a delay of four business days in the filing of a Complete Cargo Declaration (manifest),
the FSIS regulations were amended to allow a vessel carrying a shipment of meat or meat products to clear in those instances
where the duplicate export certificate is not available at departure time. In lieu of the duplicate export certificate,
the shipper, shipper's agent or the vessel's agent must provide Customs with a statement under the shipper's or agent's
letterhead signed by the shipper which briefly describes the shipment of the product, the number of boxes, the number
of pounds, the product name and the USDA export certificate number that covers the shipment. Exporters must file the
duplicate export certificate within 4 days of the clearance of a vessel carrying a shipment of meat products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to maintain consistency with Customs and USDA regulations, Customs is now proposing to amend that section
of its regulations governing the clearance of vessels carrying meat products. Section 4.72(a) of the Customs Regulations
(19 CFR 4.72(a)) currently states that no clearance shall be granted to a vessel carrying meat or meat-food product
until copies of the export certificates issued by the USDA have been filed with the district director. Customs is proposing
to amend this section so that clearance can be granted to vessels when documents complying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements of 9 CFR part 322 of the USDA regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are submitted. Shippers will still have to comply with the four-day time limit of &sect;4.75 for submitting the actual
USDA export certificate.

This rule proposes to revise various safety-related regulations regarding the design and operating procedures
of production platforms and pipelines in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The purpose of the revisions is to reduce
or prevent the unintentional release of hydrocarbons from pipelines on or near offshore platforms during emergency
situations and thereby reduce the potential for explosions or fires.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The MMS is proposing to revise regulations governing design, operation, and maintenance of oil and gas facilities
in the OCS. These revisions were recommended by an internal task group that reviewed information on tow tragic offshore
incidents in 1988 and 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Safety Review Task Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A safety review task group of MMS personnel was established to review available information in the 1988 Piper Alpha
platform fire in the North Sea and the circumstances related to an interactive pipeline and platform fire in 1989 at
ARCO Oil and Gas Company's (ARCO) South Pass 60 Platform ``B'' facility in the Gulf of Mexico. The group was asked to
make specific recommendations regarding regulations and operating practices that would reduce the risk of such
incidents occurring in U.S. waters. Following is a capsule summary of each incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Explosion and Fire on Piper Alpha Platform, North Sea, 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Piper Alpha was an oil and gas production platform in the United Kingdom (U.K.) sector of the North Sea that was destroyed
by fire in 1988. On July 6, 1988, a series of events and operational mistakes caused an explosion and fires that ultimately
destroyed the platform and killed 167 people. Maintenance personnel mistakenly activated an out-of-service injection
pump causing a repair flange in the pipework to rupture. Liquid condensate leaked into the production module for several
minutes. The gas ignited and exploded, damaging the electrical power generator and the fire pumps. Eventually the
fire ruptured the shut-in gas pipelines releasing high pressure gas on the platform. The fire burned for several hours
until the pressure was relieved. The platform was completely destroyed.

The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster was published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, in November
1990. The report confirmed the conclusions reached in the initial investigation report published in September 1988.
The report concluded that in all likelihood the scenario of the leaking blind flange in the condensate injector pump
was the initial cause of the incident. The report lists 106 recommendations for improving safety in the U.K. North
Sea. The recommendations propose changes to the regulations, regulatory agency realignment, and a call for renewed
commitment to safety by industry.

Summary of South Pass 60 Platform ``B'' Fire
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 19, 1989, an offshore contracting crew was ``cold-cutting'' an 18-inch gas line riser at the platform's 10-foot
level in preparation for the installation of a pig trap. ``Cold cutting'' is a method of cutting through a section of
pipe with a mechanical cutting tool as opposed to using a blow torch. Upon penetration into the pipeline riser, pressurized
condensate began to spray from the cut area. The condensate was ignited either by sparks generated on the compressor
skid on an attendant workboat or by hot exhaust pipes on the above production deck. The fire raged upward from the riser,
and the emergency shutdown (ESD) system shut down both Platform ``B'' and Platform ``E'' and all incoming and departing
pipelines. Six of the 10 incoming and departing pipelines, including a high pressure gas line, ruptured from the heat
of the fire. The resulting explosions killed seven people and destroyed the platform.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A contributing factor to both accidents was the lack of communication and notification to personnel of the platform
production systems status. In the Piper Alpha incident, the production crew attempted to start a condensate injection
pump that was partially dismantled for repairs during the previous shift. Leaking condensate from the associated
pipework of the pump caused the first of a series of explosions and fires. The location of the pump control panel did
not allow the operator of the control panel to view the pump or detect the leak. In the South Pass 60 incident, the platform
operator and the pipeline company did not provide for adequate planning and coordination of the riser cutting operation.
Platform personnel were apparently unaware of the status of the riser cutting operation or the difficulty the contractor
was experiencing with the unexpected flow.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations for identifying out-of-service devices are found at:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 CFR 250.123(c), General platform operations. (1) Surface or subsurface safety devices shall not be bypassd or
blocked out of service unless they are temporarily out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing procedures.
Only the minimum number of safety devices shall be taken out of service. Personnel shall monitor the bypassed or blocked-out
functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any surface or subsurface safety device which is temporarily
out of service shall be flagged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for out-of-service devices on pipelines are found at 30 CFR 250.154(c). If the required safety equipment
is rendered ineffective or removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an equivalent degree
of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating
that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The task group determined that the existing regulations do not provide for adequate communication or warning of out-of-service
equipment and may not have prevented an accident similar to Piper Alpha if the same set of circumstances existed in
the OCS. The current rule does not ensure that accidental flow of hydrocarbons will not be initiated in process components
that are taken out of service, particularly if flow is initiated out of view of a flagged device or control. Flagging
requirements for out-of-service equipment and valves need to be revised to ensure that control panels and certain
equipment upstream of process equipment or valves are also flagged and that the procedure is documented. The task
group recommended that the regulations should include requirements identifying which individuals have the authority
to remove flags and to authorize equipment startup. It also recommended that subpart A be revised to include a briefing
requirement to ensure that all workers on a production platform are notified of all out-of-service equipment and
safety concerns at the beginning of each work shift or upon addition or replacement of personnel.

Location and Protection of Pipeline Risers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From the evidence gathered on Piper Alpha, at least one of the highly pressured risers ruptured when struck by debris
falling from the burning platform. The effect of gas escaping from the high pressure pipeline was catastrophic. The
escaping gas boiled to the surface, exploded, and burned under the platform for several hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart J of the regulations currently requires risers to be protected only from contact with floating vessels. Protection
is usually accomplished by locating risers between the jacket legs or by reinforcing the risers with external protection.
The task group recommended that subpart J be revised to add a requirement to provide for riser protection from falling
objects as well and that MMS require submission of piping drawings at an early stage in the platform design approval
process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the early stages of the Piper Alpha incident, fuel drums and containers of lubricants and cleaners stored throughout
the platform exploded and burned when they were exposed to flames. These materials are stored in a similar manner on
U.S. facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no current MMS regulations for fuel storage. The task group recommended that MMS revise the regulations
to require operators to store diesel and other flammable liquids on platforms in accordance with the requirements
contained in American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 500, Recommended Practice for Classification
of Locations for Electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities. The task group also recommended that the revised
regulations require operators to design fuel storage tanks in accordance with API RP 14C, Recommended Practice for
Analysis, Design, Installation and Testing of Basic Surface Safety Systems for Offshore Production Platforms.

Approval of Pipeline Repairs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon examination of the events leading to the fire on the ARCO ``B'' platform, the task group found that there was a lack
of communication and coordination between the platform operator and the pipeline repair company. The task group
recommended that the regulations be strengthened by requiring MMS approval for pipeline repairs. The Regional Supervisor,
upon being notified that the lessee or right-of-way holder is anticipating a pipeline repair, will consider the complexity
of the repair procedure in deciding whether or not to require a written repair plan. Exceptions would be made for pipeline
repairs necessitated by imminent harm to the environment or to human safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Piper Alpha fire and the Arco ``B'' fire were greatly intensified by released gas from pipelines associated with
the platforms. In the United States, incoming pipelines are required to have emergency SDV's as a protective measure,
but they are often located onboard the platform to allow access for maintenance and testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Locating SDV's away from the process equipment, such as on the seafloor or on the riser close to the waterline, may provide
a greater level of protection for the platform but would at the same time reduce accessibility for repair and maintenance.
This issue has major safety and reliability implications; therefore, MMS published the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking in the

Thirty responses to the questionnaire were received from the oil and gas industry, including major oil and gas production
companies, pipeline operators, and equipment manufacturers. The first 13 questions dealt with locating a pipeline
SDV on the seafloor or just above the splash zone. Approximately half of the respondents cited limited access to a valve,
particularly those located on the seafloor, for inspection and maintenance purposes as a major area of concern. Nearly
half of the commenters suggested that the reliability of subsea valves is unknown or nonexistent. Again, supporting
data was very limited. The remaining four questions dealt with pipeline pressure reduction during emergency situations.
The results of the questionnaire are discussed after this section.

For applications in the United States, the task group considered three distinct riser locations for the placement
of SDV's: On the platform, on the seafloor, on the vertical portion of the riser below the lowest production deck but
above the waterline. The advantages and disadvantages of each location are discussed below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first location considered was ``on the platform.'' Subpart J_Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way, &sect;250.154(b)(2)
requires that,

Incoming pipelines boarding to a production platform shall be equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) immediately
upon boarding the platform *&blank;*&blank;*

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation allows placement of the SDV on the deck where the riser enters the platform. ``Immediately upon boarding''
means near the edge of the platform. Accessibility for testing and maintenance is the greatest advantage to this location
since the valve is located within the platform structure. Also, since the valve is located in close proximity of the
production processing equipment, there is little or no hydrocarbon inventory between the valve and the process equipment
that needs to be vented in the event of an emergency. However, this location also presents the greatest potential safety
hazard. Since the valve is located near the process equipment, it is vulnerable to damage from explosions, extreme
heat from fires, and falling debris during emergency situations. The task group determined that the valve in this
location does not fulfill the intended purpose of an SDV in all situations since failure of the SDV or pressured portion
of the riser would likely result in the release of a significant portion of the pipeline inventory at the point of failure.
This vulnerability was demonstrated in the Piper Alpha disaster and the South Pass 60 fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, the task group considered locating SDV's on the seafloor a short distance from the platform. The safety advantage
of this location is obvious. The valve is isolated from the platform and is not vulnerable to explosions or fire that
may occur during an emergency situation. However, a major drawback of this location is inaccessibility for maintenance
and testing, especially in deep water. At this location, the valve would isolate the majority of the pipeline inventory
from the platform. However, there may be a significant hydrocarbon inventory in the riser between the valve on the
seafloor and the process equipment. This inventory must be safely vented when the pipeline is depressurized during
an emergency after the valve is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the task group considered locating SDV's on the vertical portion of risers below the lowest production deck
of the platform but above the waterline. This location offers several advantages. The valve is removed from and placed
below the hydrocarbon process areas within the platform, thereby isolating it from potential explosion and fire
damage during emergency situations. Also, it effectively isolates the entire inventory of the pipeline from the
platform since there is a minimal length of riser between the valve and the process equipment that must be vented during
emergency situations, and the valve is above the waterline and is accessible for maintenance and testing.

Considering the information gathered from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice and additional information regarding subsea valve installations in the U.K. North Sea, the task group concluded
that locating such valves on risers or on the seafloor was technically feasible. Other aspects of the current regulation
were also reviewed. The task group considered the current regulation which requires SDV's to be installed on incoming
pipelines only. Based on the events that occurred on Piper Alpha, the task group determined that there is a significant
potential hazard from blackflow of pressured hydrocarbons from departing pipelines. Therefore, the task group
recommended requiring SDV's on all new pipelines entering and departing production platforms. This requirement
should also apply to sulphur operations since sulphur is also flammable and poses a significant threat to safety.
This requirement would cover bidirectional pipelines, crossing pipelines, fuel lines, and pipelines carrying
flammable or hazardous fluids. Crossing pipelines that enter onto platforms but do not take on production from those
platforms pose an environmental risk, if not a risk to human safety. Therefore, crossing pipelines should also be
required to have SDV's installed on the incoming and departing risers.

_If the SDV was located on the seafloor or just above the splash zone, how would the following parameters be affected?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Subsea maintenance poses a major problem, especially for deep water which would be difficult during rough seas and
winter months. This jeopardizes the operation of the pipeline during those periods. Preventative subsea maintenance
would be impractical while maintenance by divers would pose an additional safety risk. Minor and major repairs of
a valve would most likely require removal from the pipe which is dangerous in itself and would require shutting down
the pipeline system for extended periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The splash zone is the most corrosive offshore environment. The cyclical wetting and drying of surface materials
accelerate the corrosion process and degrades protective coatings. At the splash zone, increased maintenance would
be required and most platforms have limited access in this area. Splash zone maintenance could not be performed during
rough seas or winter months, thus jeopardizing the operation of the pipeline during those periods. Control lines
would also be exposed to the corrosive wet/dry environment. Requiring SDV's to be located subsea or at the splash zone
increases the safety risk to personnel and reduces the pipeline system's reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diving cost alone to repair a subsea SDV in 180 feet of water would run between $15,000 and $18,000 per day.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Subsea SDV inspection by a diver would be of minimal value. Control systems for subsea valves are more complex than
for surface valves. The ability of divers to inspect and perform repairs underwater is questionable and cannot be
verified. Inspection and repair operations would be limited by weather conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspection of an SDV above the splash zone is reliable since it can be performed by an engineer or company representative.
All inspection information is first hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A typical subsea SDV inspection in 300 feet of water could cost between $20,000 and $30,000 per day.

Dealing with a malfunction during testing could have serious implications due to limited accessibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The higher the SDV is located above the water, the greater its accessibility, maintenance, and performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frequency of subsea SDV testing should be kept to a minimum in order to maintain valve reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

_Reliability is dependent on the individual reliability of all the components that make up the SDV and control system.
Subsea valve reliability statistics are not presently available and need to be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is assumed that the reliability of an SDV functioning on the seafloor would be less than at any other location. Access
to the SDV and control lines would be limited and equipment and personnel would be exposed to adverse conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reliability of an SDV functioning in the splash zone would be slightly higher. Accessibility would be improved
but the valve itself and control lines would be exposed to more adverse conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Subsurface SDV's would be limited by the static back pressure of the seawater, or vent lines to the surface would be
required. This may cause a delay in response time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A splash zone SDV would not have back pressure, but gas exhaust would need to be routed to the platform vent system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Underwater venting of pipelines is not recommended due to environmental considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The volume of hydrocarbons vented through the platform flare system would be greater for a subsea SDV than a platform
SDV. This is a serious safety consideration.

_What measures could be taken to enhance performance and reliability_in particular, how could problems identified
in response to question one be alleviated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Locating the SDV above the maximum wave height would alleviate most problems described in question one. Control lines
are relatively short and the valve is readily accessible for maintenance and repairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are designs where safety can be achieved by other methods. There are also ``economical'' platforms where the
producer accepts more risk to reduce facility costs. The location of the SDV should be commensurate with the level
of protection afforded to other high-risk facilities on the platform.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SDV's should be manufactured from materials which will avoid valve replacement and offer reliable performance.
The valve should have manual actuators and quick connect ends to facilitate operation or removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Platform operating decks should be made of plate, not grating. Plate acts as a fire wall. If the deck is made of plate,
the SDV can be safely located on the deck.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SDV's should be self-operating and fail-safe closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valves should be routinely inspected and tested as well as continuously monitored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SDV and control system should be protected from mechanical damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Placement of SDV's on the platform would improve reliability but would also minimize their effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redundant control and instrumentation systems may be desirable. Standards should be established for value specifications
and certification. Quality control in manufacturing could also enhance their reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valve technology has advanced to the point that reliable subsea operation is available. Advancement in the areas
of a valve failure data base and check valve technology could yield further reliability and performance.

Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any valve designed for subsea service such as a quarter turn ball valve, check valve, or a gate valve could perform as

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of hydraulically operated valves could present a pollution problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the actuator that needs to be scrutinized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No existing SDV would likely serve the purpose when located on the seafloor.

Question_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What specific limitations would be encountered with regard to placing the SDV at the seafloor location with respect
to the following variables?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Size of valve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the most part, the size of the valve is not a major factor. However, valves over 12 inches in diameter are cumbersome,
heavy and difficult to maneuver, and maintain. Valves greater than 36 inches in diameter are difficult to obtain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The valve and actuator may be quite large and may require mechanical protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the most part, pressure is not a major consideration except in deep water. Very large actuators may be needed to
overcome extreme differential pressures in deep water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flow rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For low flow rates, the reduced flow may not justify the placement of a seafloor SDV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Water depth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Water depth has a large effect on diver costs for installation, maintenance, repairs, testing, etc. Deep-water locations
also require novel installation methods, additional complexity, and further development of components and testing
methods to achieve valve reliability. Some SDV's may be designed for installation and maintenance using a drilling
rig. Beyond, 1,000 feet, diverless maintenance and retrieval become major considerations. Common valve operators
are limited to water depths of less than 3,000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In shallow water, subsea valves would be subjected to potential damage from shipping vessels.

Types of fluids transported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gas lines that are pressurized contribute a higher risk to platform safety than nonpressurized oil lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other variables identified by commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Repairing and replacing subsea SDV's would increase pollution potential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reliable valve operation is the biggest concern. Factors affecting operation include water pressure and severe
water forces on the valve and operating lines, hydrate formation, wax build up, etc. Chemical injection may be necessary
to prevent hydrate or wax build up.

Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Actuators can be powered by line pressure, stored gas pressure, or hydraulics. Fail-safe operation would be desirable.
Pneumatic and hydraulic systems are the most reliable for subsea service. Manual operation is also necessary. Electrical
systems could be used, but a backup system would be desirable. It is also necessary to provide manual diver valve actuation
for emergency situations.

Question
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_What emergency support systems (e.g., fire loop system, ESD system, subsurface safety system) would activate the
subsea SDV? Should the conditions of actuation be different than for an SDV located on the platform?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_All ESD and fire loop systems could operate the SDV. There would need to be a control line between the valve actuator
and the platform. This could pose a maintenance problem. Pressure sensors could also be installed for the case of a
ruptured or blocked line. This would require a relief valve, which brings up the following question. Where would the
relief valve relieve to, the seafloor? The foregoing provides yet another reason to have the SDV above water.

Question
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_For seafloor placement of the SDV, what would be the optimum location in distance from the platform?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Distance is not very important. The closer to the platform, the better. This would keep the control lines the shortest.
Placing the valve 40 feet below the water surface on the riser would make it accessible to divers while providing its
structural protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The location of an SDV relative to the platform should ideally be decided by a quantified risk analysis. The optimum
distance for placement of an SDV should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering water depth, anchorage
areas, fishing areas, and minimizing the inventory between the platform and the SDV.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

_Burial would not hurt the SDV, but it would make it harder for divers to find it. Burial would increase the diving costs
associated with maintenance. Burial would preclude using a remotely operated vehicle for inspection and maintenance
and should be avoided.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_API Spec 6D, Specification for Pipeline Valves, is a sufficient standard for valves, so certification is not necessary.
Pipeline SDV's are not critical to permanent containment of hydrocarbons. However, proper maintenance of subsea
valves may be a bigger issue.

Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Not so long as the pipeline is properly anchored at the valve location. High seas could pose a difficult problem (keeping

Question
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_If an SDV is placed at an alternate seafloor location, should an ADV also be placed on the platform?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_An SDV installed on a platform has a different function than a subsea SDV. The platform SDV mitigates consequences
of a hydrocarbon release from the process equipment by isolating the pipeline from those facilities. Subsea SDV's
mitigate the consequences of a hydrocarbon release from the pipeline which may occur as a primary or secondary event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, redundancy is always safer. However, redundancy costs more for equipment and increases the chance for
malfunction and platform downtime. Placement of a surface SDV should not be required but considered an option. In
general, SDV's should not be placed on the seafloor except in unusual circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an SDV is installed above the splash zone, there is no need for another one on the seafloor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Current regulations require SDV's on certain incoming pipelines. What, if any, SDV's should be required on outgoing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_There is no need to place SDV's on all outgoing or crossing pipelines. Adding more valves is not necessary; however,
present valves may need to be relocated to safer locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SDV's should be placed on new outgoing and crossing pipelines. A risk assessment should be performed on existing
lines before making such modifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flow safety valves are adequate and less likely to fail, due to their simplistic design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unmanned platforms that contain no production facilities, no compression, and no power source should not require
SDV's.

Question
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_What options are available to allow rapid reduction of pipeline pressure in an emergency, and what are the benefits
and drawbacks of the techniques?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Rapid reduction of pipeline pressure is a formidable problem. Flaring at the platform can be a very slow method of
reducing pipeline pressure. Strategically located SDV's along the pipeline may offer an alternative to depressurization.
An outlying subsea vent is probably safest since it distances the gas from the platform. However, in most cases, rapid
pressure reduction is expensive and of limited use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is the damage of the formation of hydrate plugs and liquid plug flow as well as the need to prevent expanding vapor

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
System dependability might be enhanced by subsea diversion but not enough to offset additional cost over platform
diversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsea diversion could place evacuating and rescuing personnel in peril and could pose a significant pollution problem.

Question_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
What are the advantages and disadvantages of having the capability to blow down a pipeline from both ends?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It may be good engineering practice to locate blowdowns at each end of a pipeline. One end may be inaccessible due to
fire or failure. If both ends are accessible, a more rapid blowdown can be accomplished. However, the majority of damage
and injuries on a platform occurs during the first few minutes and before pressure could be reduced. Actual damage
is not likely to be significantly reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would be necessary to bypass the check valve of the outgoing line. The bypass would need to be maintained and tested.
Facilities for large scrubbing, liquid handling, and flaring would also be required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Question_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should pipelines be required to have the capability of rapid reduction of pipeline pressure from either end and, if
so, what length of time should be specified as the maximum time for pipeline pressure reduction in an emergency situation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rapid pressure reduction is impractical during emergencies. Larger lines and volumes must be depressurized more
slowly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pest solution is accident prevention and efficient platform evacuation. Gas pipeline pressure cannot be reduced
fast enough to prevent early damage during a platform emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an emergency, evacuation is the primary concern. Flaring large volumes of gas could create a dangerous situation
for aircraft and boats.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Revise &sect;250.1, Documents incorporated by reference, to incorporate API's Recommended Practice for Classification
of Locations for Electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities, First Edition, June 1, 1991 (API RP 500), into
the regulations. This document replaces API RP 500B, Recommended Practice for Classification of Areas for Electrical
Installations at Drilling Rigs and Production Facilities on Land and on Marine Fixed and Mobile Platforms, Second
Edition, with Supplement. API RP 500 combined API RP 500A, 500B, and 500C into a single document to provide guidelines
for classifying locations at petroleum facilities for the selection and installation of electrical equipment.
API RP 500 contains essentially the same information contained in API RP 500B. API RP 500 is referenced in &sect;250.51(i)
to classify fuel and other flammable liquid storage locations. Also, references to API RP 500 replace API RP 500B in
&sect;&sect;250.53(b), 250.122(e)(4)(i), 250.123(b)(9)(i), 250.291(b)(3) and (d)(4)(i), and 250.292(b)(4)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Add a new &sect;250.27, Safety of operations communication, that requires operators of offshore production platforms
to notify incoming or new personnel arriving on the platform of the status of repairs of process equipment, safety
systems, or other systems that are out of service. The new regulation also requires operators to maintain records
of all communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Revise &sect;250.51, General requirements, to include requirements for fuel storage on offshore facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Revise &sect;250.123, Additional production system requirements, to be more specific on identifying and deactivating
process equipment and controls when safety systems are out of service and maintaining records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Add a new paragraph, &sect;250.153(a)(5), that requires operators to protect horizontal sections of pipeline
risers from damage by falling objects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Revise &sect;250.154 to require pipeline shutdown valves to be located below the lowest production deck on all
new pipelines entering and departing OCS platforms. This rule also applies to all pipelines under the jurisdiction
of MMS, including production flow lines, gathering lines, sulphur pipelines, fuel lines, bidirectional lines,
and crossing pipelines. For existing platforms and pipelines, the rule requires installation or relocation of valves
when significant riser repairs or maintenance is performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Revise &sect;250.158 to give the Regional Supervisor authority to require operators to submit written pipeline
repair procedures for approval. The preparation and approval of written plans ensure that an operator adequately
considers the repair activity.

air volume every 5 minutes or 1 cubic foot of air-volume flow per minute per square foot of solid floor area, whichever
is greater. Enclosed areas (e.g., buildings, living quarters, or doghouses) are defined as those areas confined
on more than four of their six possible sides by walls, floors, or ceilings more restrictive to air flow than grating
or fixed open louvers and of sufficient size to allow entry of personnel. A classified area is any area classified Class
I, Group D, Division 1 or 2, following the guidelines of API RP 500.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Department of the Interior is proposing to amend the regulations which govern how the BLM administers
livestock grazing on the public lands. A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on Friday, March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14314). The proposed rule provides for a public comment period that runs until July
28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1994, the United States Department of Agriculture published similar proposed rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 22074, 22094) which govern how the Forest Service administers livestock grazing on National Forest System
lands. These proposed rules also provide for public comments to be received by July 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the proposed rules, the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, as cooperating agencies,
have prepared a draft EIS. The draft EIS is currently being printed and prepared for distribution. Notice of availability
of the draft EIS will be made through a separate publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the preparation of the BLM proposed rule, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt met on a number of occasions throughout
the West with governors, State and local officials, ranchers, environmentalists and other public land users. These
meetings resulted in many useful suggestions that are reflected in the proposed rule. In order to continue this important
communication with user groups and members of the public, and to further elicit valuable comments on the proposed
rules of both Departments and the draft EIS, the BLM and Forest Service have jointly scheduled 49 public hearings to
be held throughout the United States on June 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Hearing Procedures

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the hearings is to provide the public an alternate method by which to comment on the proposed rules and
the EIS. The hearings do not replace the public comment period described in the proposed rules. All members of the public
may submit comments in accordance with the procedures set forth in the proposed rules and are encouraged to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearings will be preceded by informal general information sessions which will begin at 8 a.m. in each location.
The purpose of these sessions is to allow the public an opportunity to learn more about the proposed rules and EIS. BLM
and Forest Service personnel will be present to describe the key elements of the proposals, and to answer questions
so that those who wish to testify at the hearings will fully understand the proposals. These sessions are not part of
the hearing and will not appear as part of the hearing record.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearings themselves will begin at 10:30 a.m. and continue until 5 p.m., with a lunch recess to be determined by the
Hearing Officer. The hearings will resume at 7 p.m. and will continue until 10 p.m. or thereafter until all speakers
have been heard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to have productive and meaningful hearings and to ensure that those who wish to speak at the hearings are able
to do so in a fair and orderly manner, the following procedures will be observed:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Persons wishing to testify must register at the hearing site between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. Speakers will be heard in the
order in which they register, with the exception of elected Federal, state or local officials, who will speak first
at the beginning of each session or as otherwise arranged with the Hearing Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Each person may present testimony only once. However, if time permits, the Hearing Officer may allow each speaker
additional time after all other witnesses have had the opportunity to speak. When provided, such additional time
will be granted to speakers in the same order in which they originally testified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Because a large number of speakers is anticipated, it will be necessary to limit the amount of time of each speaker.
Since the number of speakers may vary greatly from location to location, the time allocated to each speaker may also
vary among the hearings. However, within any one hearing, all speakers will be allocated an equal amount of time. The
amount of time allocated to each speaker will be left to the discretion of the Hearing Officer. Time limitations will
be strictly followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The purpose of the hearings is to elicit comments from the public. A technical representative from the BLM and Forest
Service will be present to ask clarifying questions of witnesses. Time spent asking and answering these questions
will not count against the time allocated to the speaker. Because of the time constraints and the desire to maximize
public input, the technical representatives will not respond to questions from or otherwise engage in discussions
with the speaker. Speakers who wish to ask questions should do so during the informal information session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A transcript of the hearing will be made and become part of the rulemaking record. Speakers are encouraged to submit
a written copy of their statements to be included in the hearing record. The record of the hearing will remain open through
June 13, 1994 for submission of supplemental written statements or other exhibits. The name and address of the designated
official to receive these statements or exhibits will be announced at the hearing.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standard would limit emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from existing and new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that manufacture polymers and resins produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from epichlorohydrin feedstock, specifically, basic liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epoxy resins (BLR) and non-nylon polyamide resins, also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as wet strength resins (WSR). The proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments of 1990, which require the Administrator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(b) of the Act. The intent of these standards is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the public by requiring new and existing major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources to control emissions to the level achievable by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum achievable control technology (MACT), taking into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the cost of achieving such emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions, any nonair quality and other air quality related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the amended Act requires that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate and control emissions of HAP. The control of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is achieved through promulgation of emission standards under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 112(d) and 112(f) and work practice and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards under section 112(h) for categories of sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that emit HAP. On July 16, 1992, EPA published an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of major and area source categories to be regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(57 FR 31576). Included on that list were major sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitting HAP from epoxy resins and non-nylon polyamides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The categories of major sources that would be affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this regulation are defined as the manufacture of basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid epoxy resins (BLR) and resins made of epichlorohydrin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EPI) cross-linked non-nylon polyamides, also known as wet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strength resins (WSR). The BLR source category does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the manufacture of specialty epoxy resins (epoxy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resins that are not BLR) or the modification of epoxy resins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BLR that are blended with solvents, reactive diluents, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other resins). The WSR source category are those that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made with dibasic esters, dicarboxylic acids, amines, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPI. In developing the background information to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standard, no reasons for subcategorizing either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the source categories were identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production methods used in the two source categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include both batch and continuous operations. The sizes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facilities range from those that make several thousand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds of resin per year (lb/yr) to those that produce over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 million lb/yr. Air emissions of HAP compounds originate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from breathing and working losses from storage tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
venting of process vessels, leaks from piping equipment used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to transfer HAP compounds (equipment leaks), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatilization of HAP from wastewater streams. Pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HAP) emitted from the production processes include EPI, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methanol, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Detailed information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing manufacturing processes and emissions can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in ``Emissions from Epoxy Resins Production and Non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nylon Polyamides Production_Background Information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Standards'' (EPA 453/R&hyph;94&hyph;033a), Chapter 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of 1990, only three U.S. companies were producing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLR. All three of these facilities are considered to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major sources according to the Act criterion of having the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to emit 10 tons per year of any one HAP or 25 tons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year of combined HAP. There are at least 17 facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the U.S. that manufacture WSR; of these, 9 are considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major sources because they are co-located within larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical manufacturing operations, based on the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned above. The proposed standard would apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major sources that produce BLR and/or WSR. Area sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be subject to this standard.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, EPA conducted a study that examined the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epichlorohydrin in industry. This study identified the BLR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and WSR industries as the major users of epichlorohydrin in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 112(c) of the Act, the Administrator is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to publish and from time to time revise a list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories and subcategories that emit one or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazardous air pollutants listed in section 112, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended. Information from the study of epichlorohydrin use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in industry was used during the development of the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category list. On July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576), the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published the initial list of source categories, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes epoxy resins production and non-nylon polyamides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production.

A. Source of Authority for NESHAP Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Clean Air Act gives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Protection Agency the authority to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national standards to reduce air emissions from sources that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emit one or more HAP. Section 112(b) contains a list of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be regulated by NESHAP. Section 112(c) directs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of source categories for which NESHAP will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed; this list was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). The Agency must list all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known categories and subcategories of ``major sources'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(defined below) that emit one or more of the listed HAP. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major source is defined in section 112 (a) as any stationary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source or group of stationary sources located within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contiguous area and under common control that emits or has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential to emit in the aggregate, considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, 10 tons per year or more of any one HAP or 25 tons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year or more of any combination of HAP.

B. Criteria for Development of NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from both new and existing sources according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory directives set out in section 112(d) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires the standards to reflect the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of reduction in emissions of HAP that is achievable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new or existing sources. This control level is referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to as the ``maximum achievable control technology'' (MACT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selection of MACT must reflect consideration of the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of achieving the emission reduction, any nonair quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for control levels more stringent than the floor (described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MACT floor is the least stringent level for MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. For new sources, the standards for a source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emission control that is achieved in practice by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best controlled similar source, as determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator'' (section 112(d)(3)). Existing source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards should be no less stringent than the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 percent of the existing sources for categories and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategories with 30 or more sources or the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 sources for categories or subcategories with fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 sources (section 112(d)(3)).

In a March 9, 1994

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice reopening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public comment period for determination of ``MACT floor'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for NESHAP source categories (59 FR 11018), the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered more than one interpretation of the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language concerning the MACT floor for existing sources and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicited comment on them. The MACT floor decision that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will make on the basis of this March 9, 1994 notice will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have broad precedential effects, and will presumptively be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
followed by the Agency in any rulemakings subsequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated under Title III of the Act. The MACT floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations proposed in today's rulemaking may therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by the Agency's final interpretation of ``MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor.''

IV. Summary of Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Source Categories To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would regulate HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from epoxy resins production (facilities that produce BLR), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and from non-nylon polyamides production (facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce WSR), that are determined to be major sources. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards would apply to existing sources as well as new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hazardous air pollutants emitted from existing BLR and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet strength resin production processes include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epichlorohydrin, methanol, and hydrochloric acid. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards would regulate emissions of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds, as well as any other HAP that may be emitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, note that epichlorohydrin is listed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(r) of the Act. The intent of section 112(r), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prevention of Accidental Releases, is to focus on chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that pose a significant hazard to the community should an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accident occur, to prevent their accidental release, and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize consequences should a release occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Epichlorohydrin, along with the other substances listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 112(r)(3), is listed because it is known to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause, or may be reasonably anticipated to cause death, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment (see 59 FR 4478, January 31, 1994). Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that handle epichlorohydrin in greater quantities than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established threshold quantity under section 112(r)(5) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to the risk management program requirements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(r)(7) (see 58 FR 54190, October 20, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Affected Emission Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Emission points identified for BLR and wet strength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resin production include process vents, equipment leaks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage tanks, and wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Format of the Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards for process vents, storage tanks, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater for existing facilities are presented in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit format in the units of pounds of HAP per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 million pounds of product (lb HAP/MM lb product). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities will have the option of using any control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology or pollution prevention strategy, as long as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP production-based emission limits are achieved. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit format cannot be used for the standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new facilities because it would identify a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's production level, which is claimed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidential business information. Therefore, standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new facilities are in the equipment standard format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities would have to implement the controls specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard, or demonstrate equivalency, to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA solicits comments on the equipment standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format of the standards for process vents, storage tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wastewater at new facilities. In particular, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comments on whether performance standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities can be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without compromising confidential business information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether operators can comply with performance standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromising confidential business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards for equipment leaks are specified for new and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing BLR facilities, and are presented as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard for new and existing wet strength resin facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment leak standards are in the form of equipment/work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice standards. Facilities would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the program specified in the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to achieve compliance with the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Table 1 summarizes the standards for existing BLR and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WSR sources. In each case, for purposes of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the emission requirements, the source was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided into two portions: (1) The combination of process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, and (2) equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks. The proposed standards for BLR production would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require existing facilities to limit emissions from all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater combined to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level at or below 130 lb HAP/MM lb production. Existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLR facilities would also be required to implement the leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detection and repair (LDAR) program specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks (40 CFR part 63, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart H). The LDAR program specified under subpart H 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires specific equipment modifications and work practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that reduce emissions from equipment leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For new BLR facilities, the standards would be based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the technology used by the best performing facility in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is the use of a 99 percent efficient water scrubber on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all process vents coupled with recirculation of the scrubber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent to the process, and 99 percent control of emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wastewater. As for existing facilities, new facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to implement the LDAR program of subpart H 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to control equipment leak emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For existing wet strength resin facilities, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards would require an emission limit of 10 lb 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP/MM lb product from process vents, wastewater, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage tanks combined. No emission limits or equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are required for equipment leaks; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities may elect to implement the subpart H LDAR program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lieu of complying with the emission limit for process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, as this alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would achieve a greater emission reduction. Similar to BLR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, for new wet strength resin facilities, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards would be based on the technology used by the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing source in the category. This technology is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a water-cooled condenser, from which the outlet gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature shall be no higher than 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, on the batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor and no methanol by-product formation or hydrochloric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid usage, or the implementation of the subpart H LDAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to control equipment leak emissions.

To determine compliance with the emission

BLR source category.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For basic liquid resin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, tests would be required to determine the flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and HAP concentration of emissions from process vents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, where applicable, storage tank vents that are combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with process vents. Data from three 1-hour tests would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to calculate an average HAP emission rate in pounds per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour. Initial performance tests for uncontrolled streams or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams controlled by devices other than flares and certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boilers and process heaters would consist of measuring HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration using the EPA Method 18 or Method 25A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Method 25A may be used only if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single HAP compound greater than 50 percent of the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP in the vent stream and that HAP compound is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for calibration. Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A is specified for measuring vent stream flowrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the production-based emission rate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vents, the owner or operator would calculate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hourly rate of production based on production data for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year and the actual operating hours during the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual period. For each vent, the hourly emission rate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined from the average of three 1-hour tests, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided by the hourly production rate (calculated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above) to determine the production-based emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for the vent. The sum of production-based emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates from all process vents (and storage tank vents if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manifolded with process vents) constitutes the first term in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equation used to determine compliance. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are divided by the annual production of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year, testing must take place under operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that represent the production rate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions from storage tanks not manifolded with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vents would be calculated according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology described in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(3). The annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions would be divided by the annual production from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year to determine the production-based emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate from storage tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions from wastewater would be calculated according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the methodology described in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly emissions calculated using this methodology would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided by a monthly production rate, which would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated by dividing the annual production rate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year by 12. Testing is required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 163.150(f)(5) to determine wastewater stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters such as the flow rate and HAP concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because emissions would be divided by a production rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated using production data for the previous year, test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions must reflect typical production for the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
WSR source category.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a process uses a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser to recover HAP, emissions would be calculated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purpose of determining compliance using equations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for batch operations, in lieu of compliance tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing would be required to determine the emission rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from uncontrolled vents and vents controlled by devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than condensers. Testing requirements are the same as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the BLR source category, except that testing would take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place over the batch cycle, rather than hourly. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the production-based emission rates used in the equation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine compliance would be calculated based on emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and production data obtained on a per-batch basis, not per-hour as is the case for the BLR source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the BLR source category, storage tank emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations would follow the methodology described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.150(f)(3). The methodology of 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be used to determine emissions from wastewater.

 To determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the standard for equipment leaks, BLR and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WSR facilities would have to demonstrate that an LDAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart H (40 CFR 63.160&hyph;63.183) is in place. This includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of the test methods and procedures used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify the adequacy of monitoring equipment outlined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.180.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BLR source category.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for new BLR sources are essentially equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, control efficiencies are required for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment specified in the standards. Therefore, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to installing the equipment required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, new BLR facilities would be required to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate EPA test methods to demonstrate that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common water scrubber required to control emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater is achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99 percent control. The testing methodology described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 163.150(f)(5) would be required to demonstrate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment systems are achieving 99 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
WSR source category.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The equipment standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new WSR facilities do not specify any control efficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that must be achieved. Therefore, facilities would only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to demonstrate operation of a water-cooled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser at an outlet temperature of 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methanol is being produced during the manufacturing process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that no hydrochloric acid is being used to produce WSR.

G. Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monitoring is required by the proposed standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether a BLR or wet strength resin process is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. This monitoring is done either by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Continuously measuring outlet mass flowrate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, or by (2) continuously measuring a site-specific operating parameter, the value of which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the owner or operator during the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the minimum or maximum value established for a control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device or process parameter that, if achieved by itself or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in combination with one or more other operating parameter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values, determines that an owner or operator is complying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the applicable emission limitation or standards. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of the monitoring requirements of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards is provided in Table 2.

A. Facilities Affected by These NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
These NESHAP would affect BLR and WSR facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are major sources in themselves, or constitute a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a major source. There are three existing manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLR, all of which were assumed to be major sources for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of developing these standards. (Final determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of major source status occurs as part of the compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination process). Of the 17 existing facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture WSR, 9 were assumed to be considered major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. The expected growth rate for the BLR industry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wet strength resin industry is expected to be between 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 3 percent through 1995. Impacts associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control options are presented in Table 3 and Table 4; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Air Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would reduce HAP emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing BLR sources by 95 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(105 tons per year [tons/yr]) from the baseline level, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of 78 percent from baseline. Emissions of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from existing wet strength resin sources would decrease by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 Mg/yr (2 tons/yr) if facilities elect to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor, a reduction of 7 percent from baseline. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities elect to implement the alternative standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater source, HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions would decrease by 14 Mg/yr (15 tons/yr), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of 52 percent from baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Water and Solid Waste Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards will result in the generation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3,200,000 gallons of wastewater per year from the BLR source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, assuming gas absorbers (water scrubbers) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed to control process vents and storage tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. This amount of wastewater represents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 10 percent of the wastewater currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated at the BLR production facility and a small portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the total wastewater from the plant. EPA believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional wastewater can be treated on-site in the plant's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing wastewater treatment system. Wastewater impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be less if an alternative control measure is used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no wastewater generated from the WSR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production process, because emissions are controlled with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensers. There is also no solid waste generated from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLR or WSR production processes.

D. Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for the BLR source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require an additional energy usage of 1.5 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Btu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per year (Btu/yr). Additional energy usage for the WSR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category is 4 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Btu/yr if the MACT floor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented; however, if facilities elect to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative standard, the additional energy usage is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Cost Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission reductions that would be required by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation could be met using one or more of several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different techniques. To determine costs, certain control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios were assumed. The scenarios used in costing were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judged to be the most feasible scenarios possible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the requirements of the proposed standards from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical and cost standpoint. The total control cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the capital cost to install the control device, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs involved in operating the control device, and costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with monitoring the device to ensure compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring costs include the cost to purchase and operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring devices, as well as reporting and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs required to demonstrate compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost impacts of the proposed standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. Nationwide, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual cost of this standard to the BLR industry is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$140,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost of this regulation to the wet strength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resin industry is $520,000, assuming all facilities do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide to achieve compliance with the alternative standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(controlling equipment leaks). If all facilities 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
do
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with the alternative standard, the total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost is $52,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic impact analysis of this standard shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the estimated price increase from compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended alternative for process vents, storage tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wastewater is 0.05 percent for BLR. Estimated reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in market output for BLR is 0.08 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For WSR, control of equipment leaks is not required, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but is allowed as an alternative standard because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better than the MACT floor level of control for vents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, and wastewater. Assuming compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative standard for WSR, the estimated price increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is 0.22 percent and the estimated reduction in market output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is 0.20 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of Emission Points To Be Covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Emissions from BLR and WSR production occur from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following emission points: Storage tanks, process vents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks, and wastewater. The proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider all of these emission points. Wastewater emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wet strength resin facilities are negligible, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are included as an emission point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Designation of Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For these proposed standards, a source is defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all HAP emission points within a facility that are related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the production of BLR or WSR, including process vents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage tanks, wastewater, and equipment leaks. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of developing the standards, the emission points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the definition of the source are divided into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two portions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission points; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Equipment leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator considered proposing a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit that would apply to process vents, storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, wastewater and equipment leaks. However, equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks cannot be included with process vents, storage tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wastewater because: (1) The negotiated standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks has no fixed performance level; and (2) no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method currently exists for determining the magnitude of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable emissions to assign for leaks. Without a method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the magnitude of allowable emissions to assign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for equipment leaks, an averaging policy that included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks would be difficult to enforce. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MACT floor and each regulatory alternative has two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components_one for the combination of process vents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage tanks, and wastewater, and another for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks. When methods are developed to assign allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission levels for particular leak points, the EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider revising these standards to allow inclusion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks in the emission limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator also considered proposing separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limits for each type of emission point, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this approach was not feasible because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, and wastewater emission points are intertwined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing control strategies. For example, in existing BLR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, process vents and storage tank emissions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manifolded together and controlled using a common device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The device commonly used to control these emissions is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water scrubber, which functions in transferring potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP emissions from gaseous point sources to a wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission source. Therefore, a single emission limit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined to give facilities flexibility in complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard. Specifying a single emission limit for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of emission points gives facilities the latitude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the best way for them to achieve emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions. Separate regulatory options were identified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks for the reasons described at the beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Existing Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. BLR Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because there are three existing facilities in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that produce BLR (all three are believed to be major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources), EPA used the average of the total production-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission factors achieved by the three facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the MACT floors. Using this method, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production-based emission limit of 130 lb HAP/MM lb product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was established as the MACT floor for the process vents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from BLR facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing BLR facilities control equipment leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions using various leak detection and repair (LDAR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The impacts associated with the MACT floor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives for sources at existing BLR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are presented in Table 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative II represents the highest level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of control identified for existing BLR sources. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT floor for the process vents, storage tanks, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater portion of the source reflects a high level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control (the use of water scrubbers, carbon adsorbers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated condensers, and flares on process and storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank vents, and biodegradation to reduce emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater), only one area was identified as a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional controlled emission point: the generation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP-containing scrubber effluent, which is normally routed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the facility's wastewater treatment system. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater could be controlled by recirculating scrubber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent to the process. This measure would result in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit of 125 lb HAP/MM production. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this emission limit was chosen for Regulatory Alternative II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the source. The control method proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks portion of the source was to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDAR program specified in 40 CFR 63, subpart H, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents a higher level of control than is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practiced by any existing BLR facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating Regulatory Alternative II, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy).
Regulatory Alternative II was rejected because the incremental emission reduction over Regulatory Alternative
I (2 Mg/yr [2 tons/yr]) is not significant considering the associated cost. Water and energy impacts were examined;
however, because the magnitude of these impacts were small, they were not a major factor in the decision to reject Regulatory
Alternative II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first regulatory alternative above the MACT floor (Regulatory Alternative I) considered for existing BLR sources
was to implement the LDAR program specified in 40 CFR 63, subpart H to control the equipment leaks portion of the source,
and to require the MACT floor emission limit of 130 lb HAP/MM lb product for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater
portion. The LDAR program of subpart H would achieve a higher level of control than the MACT floor; also, the cost of
this control option was judged to be reasonable (see Table 3). Therefore, the Administrator selected Regulatory
Alternative I as the standard for existing BLR sources.

2. WSR Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MACT floor for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater for existing wet strength resin facilities was calculated
based on data supplied by the nine major sources making up this source category. The MACT floor represents the average
value of the lowest five production-based emission totals from major sources in the industry. For the process vents,
wastewater, and storage tanks portion of the source, the emission limit is 10 lb/MMlb production. Because no existing
facility in the WSR source category controls equipment leak emissions, the MACT floor for the equipment leaks portion
of the source represents an uncontrolled situation. Impacts associated with the MACT floor and regulatory alternatives
for sources at existing wet strength resin facilities are presented in Table 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative II, the most stringent alternative identified for existing WSR sources, would require an
emission limit of 5 lb HAP/MM lb product for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source,
as well as requiring the subpart H LDAR program for the equipment leaks portion of the source. In evaluating Regulatory
Alternative II, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy). Regulatory Alternative
II was rejected because the incremental emission reduction over Regulatory Alternative I, (1 Mg/yr) is not significant
considering the associated cost. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative
II; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative I, the first regulatory alternative above the MACT floor for existing WSR sources, would
require the MACT floor emission limit of 10 lb HAP/MM lb production for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater
portion of the source, and the LDAR program described in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H for the equipment leaks portion of
the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water,
and energy). Considering the emission reduction and cost of Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator judged
this option to be unreasonable. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative
I; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because both Regulatory Alternatives were judged to be unreasonable, the control levels proposed for both the combined
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater emission points, as well as the equipment leaks portions of existing
WSR sources are the MACT floor levels. However, the Administrator proposes the implementation of the subpart H LDAR
program for equipment leaks as an equivalent standard for existing WSR sources. The subpart H LDAR program represents
an effective control option with reasonable associated costs for the equipment leaks portion of the source, with
significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. The subpart H LDAR program
was chosen as an alternative standard because it achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or better than
that achieved by the technology basis for the floor level of control for vents, tanks, and wastewater and because costs
of implementation of this LDAR program are in many cases much more reasonable than those incurred from requiring compliance
with the emission limit (see Table 4).

D. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed Standards for New Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. BLR Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For new sources, the MACT floor shall be no less stringent than the level representing the best controlled similar
source. For new BLR sources, the MACT floor for the portion of the source consisting of the combination of process vents,
storage tanks and wastewater is achieved by: (1) Routing process vents and storage tank vents to a common water scrubber
with an efficiency of 99 percent; (2) recirculating scrubber effluent back to the process, and (3) Controlling HAP
emissions from wastewater by 99 percent. This strategy represents a 99 percent emission reduction for this portion
of the source. No regulatory alternatives more stringent than the new source MACT floor could be identified for this
portion of new BLR sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT floor for the equipment leaks portion of new BLR sources is the LDAR program of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative I for new BLR sources would require sources to implement the subpart H LDAR program to control
equipment leaks, in addition to the MACT floor requirement for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater. The
subpart H LDAR program represents a cost-effective control option for equipment leaks with significant emission
reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. For these reasons, the Administrator chose
Regulatory Alternative I as the proposed standard for new BLR sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. WSR Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MACT floor for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater for new wet strength resin facilities is achieved
by equipping the batch reactor with a cooling water condenser, and by operating the process without the use of hydrochloric
acid and prohibiting the formation of methanol. This represents the highest level of control that is technically
feasible. Therefore, no regulatory alternatives above the MACT floor could be identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no existing facility in the WSR source category is controlling equipment leak emissions, the MACT floor represents
an uncontrolled situation. Regulatory Alternative I for new WSR sources is the LDAR program described in 40 CFR part
63, subpart H for the equipment leaks portion of the source (the same as for existing facilities), and the MACT floor
equipment standard described in the previous paragraph for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion
of the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, costs, water,
and energy). Considering the emission reduction and cost of Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator judged
this option to be unreasonable. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative
I; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the only Regulatory Alternative above the MACT floor was judged to be unreasonable, the control levels proposed
for both the combined process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater emission points, as well as the equipment leaks
portions of new WSR sources are the MACT floor levels. However, the Administrator proposes the implementation of
the subpart H LDAR program for equipment leaks as an equivalent standard for new WSR sources. The subpart H LDAR program
represents an effective control option with reasonable associated costs for the equipment leaks portion of the source,
with significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. The subpart H LDAR
program was chosen as an alternative standard because it achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or
better from that achieved by the technology basis for the floor level of control for vents, tanks, and water and because
costs of implementation of this LDAR program are expected to be much more reasonable than those incurred from requiring
compliance with the emission limit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The formats of the proposed standards were selected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to give facilities the most flexibility possible in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving the level of control required by the selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative. Because the MACT floor for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source reflects control by various methods, the format needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow sufficient flexibility for facilities to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of the standard using the various control methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already in place to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the formats considered (mass emission limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent concentration, percent reduction, equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, work practice standards), the mass emission limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format was chosen because various combinations of controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be employed among several emission points to achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same mass emission rate. Also, mass emission limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage facilities to reduce emissions through process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes, work practice changes, and other methods to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costly add-on controls. In this way, mass emission limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve to encourage pollution prevention. An equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard format is not needed for this source because an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit can be established. Formats such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying a concentration or a percent reduction, offer no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages over the emission limit format, and would be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumbersome from an enforcement standpoint due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different characteristics of the emission points that make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up the source of process vents, storage tanks, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For process vent, storage tank, and wastewater emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points within new sources, however, equipment standards have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been proposed. An emission limit format cannot be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these emission points within new sources because it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify specific facilities' production levels, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimed as confidential business information. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities would have the opportunity to employ other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies to meet the standard by demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA solicits comments on the equipment standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format of the standards for process vents, storage tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wastewater at new facilities. In particular, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comments on whether performance standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities can be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without compromising confidential business information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether operators can comply with performance standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromising confidential business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LDAR program of 40 CFR part 63, subpart H is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of an equipment standard/work practice format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 112 of the Act, national emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must, whenever possible, take the format of a numerical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standard. Typically, an emission standard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written in terms of an allowable emission rate, performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level, or allowable concentration. These types of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the direct measurement of emissions to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. For some emission points, emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be prescribed because it is not feasible to measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. Section 112(h)(2) recognizes this situation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defining two conditions under which it is not feasible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish an emission standard. These conditions are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and constructed to emit or capture the pollutant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or (2) if the application of measurement methodology is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable due to technological and economic limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an emission standard cannot be established, the EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead establish a design, equipment, work practice, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational standard or combination thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For equipment leak emission points, such as pumps and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valves, EPA has previously determined that it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible to prescribe or enforce emission standards. Except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those items of equipment for which standards can be set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a specific concentration, the only method of measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions is total enclosure of individual items of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, collection of emissions for a specified time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, and measurement of the emissions. This procedure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as bagging, is a time-consuming and prohibitively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive technique considering the great number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual items of equipment in a typical process unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this procedure would not be useful for routine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and identification of leaking equipment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair. Therefore, LDAR program of 40 CFR, subpart H, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment/work practice standard, was chosen for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks emission point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Selection of Compliance and Performance Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions and Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation contains compliance provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require owners or operators to conduct an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance test to demonstrate compliance with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. As a means of demonstrating compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards following the initial performance test, the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator must also establish source-specific parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the characteristics of the emission stream, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, or type of control device used. The Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that these provisions were necessary to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements of the General Provisions (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 63, subpart A).

1. Testing and Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance is comprised of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial performance testing and continuous compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification, or monitoring. The proposed requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial compliance testing and any periodic or continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement to verify ongoing compliance are based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission stream characteristics that would be encountered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either at the outlet of the control device or at the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of release to the atmosphere for uncontrolled emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams. Often, an important factor to consider in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating emission stream characteristics is the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device that is preceding the emission stream. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operating parameters of the device can be used as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator of the level of control of the device and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, the outlet emissions. The selection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate test methods for initial and ongoing compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, is related to both the characteristics of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream and to the type of device used to control it. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of both factors is presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Emission Stream Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristic to consider when evaluating measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods are whether the streams are from continuous sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or whether they are from batch sources. Streams that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from continuous sources would have minimal variation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics; the test measurement method therefore can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be intermittent in nature. For example, flowrate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration can be sampled on an intermittent basis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain an average emission value that presumably will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary significantly. Batch emission streams, however, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to have wide variation in flowrate, composition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conditions throughout the course of a batch (i.e., with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time). Often, proportional sampling of flowrate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition over the course of a batch to arrive at a total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission number over the entire batch is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, simultaneous measurement of flowrate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition must be made to arrive at an instantaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission rate. Because these methods are difficult, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial compliance test requiring concentration measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not recommended for most batch operations. Specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these NESHAP, equations are provided in the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine HAP emissions from the batch reactor used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WSR production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second important characteristic of the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream to consider during selection of a test method is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition. If organic material other than HAP are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the stream, it may be necessary to speciate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream or at least identify the HAP constituents in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream. This identification limits how continuously the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream can be sampled. The most common technology that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in identification is gas chromatography, specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in EPA Reference Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gas chromatography, coupled with the quantification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material typically done with a flame-ionization device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FID), EPA Reference Method 25A, can be done at sub-minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals, but not continuously. However, if identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of organic species is not necessary, an FID alone can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used. This technology will provide a continuous reading of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The devices used to abate HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions will affect the outlet stream composition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions and therefore affect the degree of confidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial and continuous compliance methods. Devices that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are commonly used in the basic liquid resins and WSR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry to control process vents and storage tank emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are condensers, gas absorbers (water scrubbers), carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adsorbers, and flares. These devices differ from one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another in the type of streams that they control and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlet conditions of the streams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Condensers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of condensers, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually applied to saturated emission streams and by design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield saturated streams, it can be assumed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components will be present at levels corresponding to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturated values (equilibrium) at the outlet conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This measure provides a worst-case estimate of emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the direct measurement of concentration often may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be foregone in lieu of the measurement of stream temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and flow rate and subsequent calculation to yield mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. For wet strength resin batch reactors, this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required measurement to determine HAP concentration in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both initial and continuous performance tests. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission streams controlled by condensers in basic liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resin manufacturing will be more likely to have multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources with numerous components that will affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to predict HAP concentrations by measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary parameters, the direct measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration is required at least in the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance test. Thereafter, concentration measurements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish continuous compliance may be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximated with a measurement of outlet gas temperature.

Gas Absorbers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gas absorbers (water scrubbers), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, differ in that there is no parameter that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured and used to establish a limit of HAP concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Often, the streams routed to scrubbers are more dilute, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control device functions in not only changing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of the gas temperature like a condenser would do, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but in employing concentration gradients to remove materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from gas streams. In order to predict the performance of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas absorber, information must be known about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate mass transfer coefficients for the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Most often, the mass transfer coefficients are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimentally derived for specific applications and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually functions of the mass velocities and contacting path 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables. While it is possible to calculate the scrubber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlet compositions without mass transfer information by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuming that the amount of material transferred to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid is limited by the equilibrium-defined composition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this information is not indicative of the physical scrubber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it does not provide for the evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacting path. Therefore, a direct measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition is required during the initial performance test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation of continuous compliance need not be done by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous direct measurement of HAP concentration from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrubber effluent, however. Another parameter, the liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to gas molar ratio through the scrubber, could be monitored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure required removal. The L/G ratio, which often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces to the measurement of L, the liquid molar flow rate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because G, the gas molar flow rate is often constant, could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be measured during the initial performance test to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sensitivity of the ratio with removal efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thereafter, the L/G ratio could be used to verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate removal if the ratio remained within the limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established during the initial compliance test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Carbon Adsorbers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Streams controlled by carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adsorption will usually be diluted, compared to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled by condensers and scrubbers. No surrogate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters have been identified as measures of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration or removal efficiencies. Therefore, a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of concentration will be required during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial performance test as well as in continuous compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flares. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance testing for flares can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicated by the formation of undesired products of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion (including HAP) and the inability to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture and control these byproducts. Nevertheless, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility chooses to use a flare as a control device, EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established flare combustion efficiency criteria that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify that 98 percent or greater combustion efficiency can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be achieved provided that certain operating conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. If a HAP is formed from combustion, the quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formed must be considered when calculating control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency. These conditions prescribe that the flare must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be operated with no visible emissions and with a flame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present and that the heating value and exit velocity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas routed to the flare must be within certain ranges, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending upon whether the flares are steam-assisted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the NESHAP general provisions provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an initial performance test to determine whether the net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating value will fall within the applicable ranges for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control at 98 percent. The performance test involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring the incoming gas flowrate and the concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustible compounds (40 CFR 63.11) to determine net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating value. However, it appears that as the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds in the stream increases, the determination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net heating value becomes increasingly difficult. Also, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light of the fact that flares are often used to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discontinuous or upset conditions, the net heating value at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any one time is subject to change. Continuously measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concentration of combustible compounds to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating value on a continuous basis is probably not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible. Therefore, the enhanced monitoring method chosen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these standards is to require that the presence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot flame be monitored continuously. Also, an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement and characterization of the inlet mass emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the flare is required for two reasons:

and

2. To determine the net heating value of the vent

v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wastewater. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because air emissions from wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment systems cannot be collected and measured, certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters must be identified that indicate the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate from wastewater for monitoring purposes. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for estimating wastewater emissions for initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the proposed standards for the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as for identifying enhanced monitoring parameter values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for wastewater, are those specified in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5) consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring specific wastewater treatment parameters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission calculation methods. Monitoring of the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater parameters is required: inlet flow rate, HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, pH, and biological oxygen demand. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters were chosen for monitoring because they can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to determine wastewater treatment system performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vi. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Storage Tanks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Storage tank emissions vary greatly over time, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibits testing over reasonable periods of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no initial compliance test is proposed for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission point, unless emissions are manifolded with process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, in which case the compliance tests specified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vents apply. Instead, the methods specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.150(f)(3) are proposed to calculate emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions would be calculated based on the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent usage records for the most recent 1-year period and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided by the amount of product produced during the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. A 1-year period is necessary to reduce the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of variation in solvent usage on the emission calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because emissions are calculated from factors, and because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage tank emissions are not dependent on parameters that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be controlled, no continuous monitoring requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for this emission point, except that facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that control storage tank emissions must certify that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls are in proper working order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equipment Leaks. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like wastewater emissions, equipment leak emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in open areas and in most cases cannot feasibly be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captured. Therefore, no performance test is required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment leaks source. Instead, facilities must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that they have an LDAR program in place that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart H. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements are proposed for equipment leaks, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standard for equipment leaks is a work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice/equipment standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Averaging Times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initial compliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards for the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater source at existing BLR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and WSR production facilities are in the form of mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limits. Initial compliance is determined by adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions per unit mass of product calculated for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process vent, storage tank, and wastewater emission point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the facility. For BLR production, a continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, a 1-hour averaging time is specified for process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vent compliance tests; the emission rate would be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average of the results of three 1-hour tests. For WSR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, typically a batch operation, the emission rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to determine compliance would be the average of 3 tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken over for 3 different batch runs. Longer averaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times are required for batch operations to minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of emissions that vary significantly with time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage tank emissions would be averaged over a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1 year, based on HAP usage records from the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, to minimize the effect of variation in solvent usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the calculated emission rate. A monthly averaging time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required for wastewater, as specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). Different averaging times are possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for different emission types because emissions are divided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the production rate for an equal time period. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting production-based emissions are then added together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to Equation 1 and compared with the mass emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit to determine compliance.

Monitoring. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;63.8(c)(4) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the General Provisions, all continuous monitoring systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring either emissions or an operating parameter shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a minimum of one measurement cycle (sampling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BLR source category. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For BLR manufacturers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of compliance varies for each type of control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or capture system. Owners and operators complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard by using carbon adsorbers, condensers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators, and total enclosures on continuous processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be determined to be out of compliance with the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if, for any 1-hour period, the average operating parameter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value exceeds or is less than the value established during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial performance test, as applicable. A 1-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaging time is chosen to determine compliance because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parallels the length of time for each of the three test runs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted for the initial performance test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
WSR source category. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wet strength resins are produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in batch processes, during which emissions may vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly. Therefore, longer averaging times are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for WSR processes than for BLR processes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaging time proposed for WSR processes is the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to complete one batch operation (typically about 8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours). Because producers of WSR do not vary the production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process from batch to batch, emissions data averaged over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the course of one batch operation would be representative of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual emissions from future batch runs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

G. Selection of Reporting and Recordkeeping

Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner or operator of any BLR or wet strength resin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility subject to these standards would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill all reporting requirements outlined in the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions 40 CFR part 63. No special considerations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been identified for these industries that would warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Operating Permit Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Title V of the Act, all HAP-emitting facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be required to obtain an operating permit. Oftentimes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limits, monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are scattered among numerous provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State implementation plans (SIP's) or Federal regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the proposed rule for the operating permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program published on May 10, 1991 (58 FR 21712), this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit program would include in a single document all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that pertain to a single source. Once a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's permit program has been approved, each facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing that source within that State must apply for and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain an operating permit. If the State wherein the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is located does not have an approved permitting program, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner or operator of a source must submit the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the proposed General Provisions of 40 CFR part 63.

C. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Have an annual effect of the economy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order. EPA has submitted this action for OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations will be documented in the public record.

D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1681.01), and a copy may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401 M Street SW., (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public reporting burden for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this collection of information is estimated to average 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours per source, including time for reviewing instructions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other aspect of this collection of information, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy Branch, 2136, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB or public comments on the information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements contained in this proposal.

E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act guidelines for regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like this one whose start action notifications (SAN's) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed before April 1992 indicate that an economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered significant if it meets one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Compliance increases annual production costs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 5 percent, assuming costs are passed onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Compliance costs as a percentage of sales for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities are at least 10 percent more than compliance costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a percentage of sales for large entities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Capital costs of compliance represent a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant'' portion of capital available to small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, considering internal cash flow plus external 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial capabilities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Regulatory requirements are likely to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies that this rule will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the affected BLR and WSR producers are large enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to satisfy the criteria for a small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, no significant small business impacts will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from compliance with these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this proposal was preceded by consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welcome comments on all aspects of the proposed regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including health, economic and technical issues, and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed test methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation will be reviewed 8 years from the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of promulgation. This review will include an assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such factors as evaluation of the residual health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental risks, any overlap with other programs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of alternative methods, enforceability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improvements in emission control technology and health data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today's action proposes emission standards for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts (25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horsepower). This action is authorized by section 213(a)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Clean Air Act as amended. The proposed standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to result in a 32 percent reduction in hydrocarbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions and a 14 percent reduction in carbon monoxide emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from these engines by the year 2020 when complete fleet turnover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is projected.

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; diskettes) of both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulatory language and the draft RSD may be obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free of charge by visiting, calling, or writing the Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection Agency, Certification Division, 2565 Plymouth Road,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulatory language and the draft RSD are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available electronically on the Technology Transfer Network 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TTN). TTN is an electronic bulletin board system (BBS) operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Authority for the actions proposed in this notice is granted to EPA by sections 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213,
215, 216, and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) as amended (42 U.S.C. 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543,
7547, 7549, 7550, and 7601(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAA section 213(a) directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine
whether emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone
or CO concentrations in more than one area that has failed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for ozone and CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes of new nonroad engines and vehicles that, in EPA's judgment
cause or contribute to such air pollution. Under CAA section 213(a)(4), EPA may also regulate emissions other than
CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and VOCs from new nonroad engines and vehicles if EPA determines that such other emissions significantly contribute
to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter, ``Nonroad Study'') required by section 213(a)(1) was completed
in November 1991. The Nonroad Study is available in docket A&hyph;91&hyph;24. The determination of the significance
of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles in more than one NAAQS nonattainment area, required by section 213(a)(2),
was proposed on May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28809) and is incorporated by reference into this proposal. At the same time, the
first set of regulations for a class or category of nonroad engines that contribute to air pollution, required by section
213(a)(3), was proposed (58 FR 28809) for new nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts
(kW). Today's action continues to implement section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
213(a)(3); it proposes emission standards for nonroad spark-ignition (SI) engines at ornd below 19 kW (25 horsepower)
(hereafter, ``small SI engines''), another class or category of nonroad engines that contributes to air pollution.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the Nonroad Study, EPA has proposed its determination that emissions of CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and VOCs from nonroad engines and vehicles contribute significantly to ozone or CO in more than one NAAQS nonattainment
area (see 58 FR 28809, May 17, 1993). According to the Nonroad Study, nonroad engines and vehicles contribute an average
of ten percent of summer VOCs in the 19 ozone nonattainment areas included in the study. Small SI engines are the source
of half of those nonroad summer VOC emissions. In the 16 CO nonattainment areas included in the study, nonroad engines
and vehicles account on average for nine percent of winter CO emissions. Small SI engines are the source of 56 percent
of the nonroad winter CO contribution, according to the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since March 1992, EPA has held several public workshops and meetings to solicit information on technical characteristics,
emissions, potential regulatory strategies, and general regulatory issues related to small SI engines. Public
notice of such meetings may be found in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the March 1992 public workshop, the Engine Manufacturers Association and the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute
encouraged federal regulation of nonhandheld small SI engines and expressed interest in working in a cooperative
program with EPA to develop regulations by November 1993. Likewise, the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers
Association encouraged federal regulation of portable 2-stroke power equipment and expressed interest in working
cooperatively with EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry's interest in federal regulation of small SI engines may be traced to California's efforts to develop a statewide
regulatory program. CAA section 209(e)(2) authorizes California to enforce emission standards for certain nonroad
engines if: (1) California determines that such standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public
health and welfare as applicable Federal standards, and such standards are not arbitrary and capricious, (2) California
needs such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, and (3) California standards and accompanying
enforcement procedures are consistent with section 209(e)(2). (See 58 FR 45866, September 6, 1991, for EPA's Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking for implementing section 209(e). This rulemaking is ongoing and the exact criteria for EPA
granting an authorization to California will be prescribed in the final section 209(e) rule. Definitions of farm
and construction equipment are also provided in this section 209(e) rule.) CAA section 209(e)(2) also authorizes
other states to opt into California standards. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has adopted standards for
nonroad lawn and garden and utility SI and CI engines from 0&hyph;25 horsepower (0&hyph;19 kilowatts). EPA is currently
reviewing CARB's section 209(e) authorization request for its lawn and garden and utility rule. A decision will be
issued once EPA's section 209(e) procedural rule is finalized. There is potential for other states to adopt the California
standards, which are scheduled to become effective in 1995, if EPA decides to approve California's waiver request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the March 1992 workshop, EPA determined that setting emission standards for the small SI engine category
might be suitable for a consultative approach to rulemaking, such as negotiated rulemaking. The Negotiated Rulemaking
Act (5 U.S.C. 581&hyph;590) establishes a framework for conducting negotiated rulemaking. Under that Act, in deciding
whether to conduct a negotiated rulemaking, the head of an agency must consider several factors, including whether,
at the preproposal stage of development, the number of identifiable parties who would come to the negotiating table
is relatively limited, the number of specific issues for which sufficient information and technology is in hand for
resolution is limited, and a time-forcing factor exists that lends an air of urgency to issuance of the rule in question.
Negotiations are conducted through a committee chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.
II section 9(c)). The goal of a regulatory negotiation committee is to reach consensus on the language or issues involved
in a rule. If consensus is reached, it is used as the basis of the Agency's proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA initiated a convening process to determine the best way to work with industry and other interested parties in developing
regulations for small SI engines. The conveners interviewed individuals in leadership roles in key organizations
identified by EPA to determine what parties were interested in these regulations, what issues were important to interested
parties, and whether a consultative rulemaking process would be feasible and appropriate. A copy of the convening
report, dated August 24, 1992, is available in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The convening report recommended an exploratory meeting of interested parties to discuss, but not initiate, a consultative
process. EPA determined that the number of parties who would come to the negotiating table would be relatively limited,
the number of specific issues for resolution would be limited, sufficient information and technology would be in
hand or could be timely developed for resolution of issues, and time-forcing factors existed. (See 58 FR 34389, June
25, 1993, for a complete discussion of the application of the factors in this case.) Time-forcing factors lending
an air of urgency to issuance of the rule include the potential threat to industry of patchwork regulation if a number
of states opt into California's program in order to attain national air quality goals. More recently, an air of urgency
has been created by the settlement of

The exploratory meeting recommended in the convening report was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan on November 16&hyph;17,
1992. Participants decided that state and public interest representatives needed more technical information to
fully understand some of the regulatory issues participants might face. It was also decided that another meeting
was necessary to discuss the potential design of a consultative process for a small SI engine rulemaking. The technical
briefing for state and public interest representatives was conducted in Ann Arbor on December 16, 1992. On January
28&hyph;29, 1993, a meeting to discuss consultative process design was held in Ann Arbor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the January meeting, it was suggested that EPA consider a two-phased approach to regulation of small SI engines.
In the suggested first phase, EPA would propose regulations for new small SI engines through the normal regulatory
process rather than a consultative process. It was suggested that Phase 1 regulations could be similar to California's
Regulation for 1995 and Later Utility and Lawn and Garden Equipment Engines, modified as necessary to meet CAA requirements.
(For example, EPA's proposal could modify CARB's program by including engines preempted from regulation in California.)
The Phase 1 proposal would be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the spring of 1994. The final rule would
be promulgated no later than spring of 1995. The suggested second phase of regulation could be developed through the
consultative process of regulatory negotiation. It could include issues such as useful life, in-use emissions,
evaporative emissions, refueling emissions, test procedure, and market-based incentive programs. Negotiations
could begin in Fall 1993 and continue for approximately 18 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to proceed with the phased approach. Today's action proposes the first phase of regulation for new
small SI engines. The data that supports the proposed emission standards and the technology, cost, and benefits assessments
for this proposal are outlined herein and in the draft Regulatory Support Document (RSD), a copy of which is located
in the public docket for this rulemaking. EPA does not currently have sufficient data to establish useful life standards
or an in-use liability program. However, rather than lose the potential early emission benefits while EPA develops
the data necessary to establish useful life and in-use liability, EPA is choosing to claim those early benefits in
this first phase of new small SI engine regulation and to continue developing the data necessary for the second phase
of small SI engine regulation. EPA believes that the potential for early benefits to public health and the environment
provided by the first phase of emission standards is of sufficient magnitude to postpone determinations of useful
life and in-use liability until the second phase of rulemaking. The phased approach to regulation of small SI engines
is incorporated in the

The scope of this rule would encompass a broad range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small SI engine applications, including farm and construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, which individual states are preempted from regulating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 209(e)(1) of the CAA. Exclusions from the rule are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, exhaust emissions from new small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines could not exceed levels for a given engine class as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in Table 1. Engine classes would be specified both by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine displacement, as measured in cubic centimeters (cc), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the type of equipment the engine powered_either handheld or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld. Five engine classes are being proposed today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each has a unique set of emission standards. Nonhandheld engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes would be: Class I_engines less than 225 cc in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement; and Class II_engines greater than or equal to 225 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cc in displacement. Engines powering equipment defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld would be classified as Class III, IV, or V: Class III_engines less than 20 cc in displacement; Class IV_engines
equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to or greater than 20 cc and less than 50 cc in displacement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class V_engines equal to or greater than 50 cc in displacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission standards being proposed today are considered Phase 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new small SI engine standards.

The rule would explicitly exclude from regulation the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following small SI engines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Engines used to propel marine vessels as defined in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions of the United States Code, 1 U.S.C. 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1992). A ``vessel'' includes every description of watercraft

used, as a means of transportation on water. 1 U.S.C. 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Engines used in underground mining or engines used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underground mining equipment and regulated by the Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety and Health Administration (MHSA). See 30 CFR parts

7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
87.1(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Engines used in recreational vehicles, which are defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines which have no installed speed governor and which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a rated speed of greater than or equal to 5,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revolutions per minute (RPM). Engines used in recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles are not used to propel marine vessels and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine under this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes the following regulatory scheme:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designation of product lines into groups of engines with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar emission characteristics (such groups are called

specified test procedure to demonstrate compliance with new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine emission standards,

B. General Enforcement Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA, as authorized in the CAA, would enforce nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in a manner similar to on-highway standards. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
213(d) of the Act provides that the standards promulgated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
213 ``shall be subject to sections (206, 207, 208, and 209), with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such modifications of the applicable regulations implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such sections as the Administrator deems appropriate, and shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be enforced in the same manner as standards prescribed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section (202).'' Section 206 specifies requirements for motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles and motor vehicle engine compliance testing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification; section 207 requires manufacturers to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance by motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines in actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use; section 208 requires recordkeeping by manufacturers of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines and authorizes EPA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect information and require reports; and section 209 preempts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states and political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards relating to emission control, certification, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless specifically authorized to do so by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this authority, EPA is proposing in today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action regulations that require manufacturers of new small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines to obtain certification and that subject them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selective Enforcement Auditing. Any manufacturer of a new small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SI engine would be responsible for obtaining from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator a certificate of conformity covering any engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced into commerce in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also proposing certain prohibited acts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general enforcement provisions similar to those for on-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles under sections 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 203 specifies prohibited acts; section 204 provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for federal court injunctions of violations of section 203(a); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 205 provides for assessment of civil penalties for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations of section 203; and section 208 provides the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with information collection authority. The general enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language of section 213(d) provides the Agency's authority for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying section 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the CAA to new small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SI engines and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As applied to nonroad engines, vehicles and equipment under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 213(d), Phase 1 prohibited acts would include, but would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An engine manufacturer's introduction into commerce of new small SI engines that are not covered by a certificate
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity issued by EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The introduction into commerce of new small SI equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles which do not incorporate the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld or handheld certified nonroad engine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tampering with emission control devices or elements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design installed on or in a small SI engine, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Failure to provide information to the Agency if requested.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is also proposing regulations, under the authority of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
205 of the Act, which set forth the maximum statutory penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for violating the prohibitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA is proposing general information collection provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to current on-highway provisions under section 208 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act which would include, but would not be limited to, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's responsibility to provide information to EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform testing if requested by EPA, and maintain records. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, EPA is proposing emission system defect reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations which require manufacturers to report to EPA emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system-related defects that affect a given class or category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. EPA enforcement personnel would be authorized to gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry and access to various facilities under section 208 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's action proposes these entry and access provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This section describes several features of EPA's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 1 small SI engine, vehicle and equipment compliance program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and EPA's rationale for including these features in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific issues related to the proposed program which require in- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depth discussion are presented in ``V. Discussion of Issues.''

1. Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This rule would apply to new nonroad spark-ignition engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have a gross power output at or below 19 kW and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured after August 1, 1996 for use in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New engines that would be covered by this rule are used in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large and varied assortment of vehicles and equipment including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lawnmowers, string trimmers, edgers, chain saws, commercial turf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, small construction equipment, and lawn and garden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates that in the first year of regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 16,525,000 new engines, or approximately 19.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the in-use fleet, would be subject to this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See Chapter 4 of the draft Regulatory Support Document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(hereafter, draft RSD) for this rulemaking.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA is proposing to require certification of new small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, not the vehicle or equipment which houses such engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, small SI engines are used in a variety of applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it is inappropriate to mandate that a specific SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine be manufactured for any given application. Second, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of manufacturers and the diversity of vehicles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment in which small SI engines are used would present clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative problems. Regulating primarily by vehicle or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment type would dramatically increase administrative cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with this rule with no comparable reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. EPA is, however, proposing to require that vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and equipment manufacturers and importers use the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified nonroad engines in their vehicles and equipment. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is discussed in ``V.H. Requirements Applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle and Equipment Manufacturers.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also considered, but rejected, the idea of including SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines above 19 kW in this Phase 1 rule. Engines above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 19 kW cutoff tend to exhibit different operating cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics than small SI engines. This difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessitates the development of additional test procedures. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient data to undertake such a development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the timeframe of this Phase 1 rule. As part of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sierra 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Club 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Browner
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 settlement, EPA will determine by November 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to undertake a rulemaking which targets emissions from SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines over 19 kW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain small SI engines which otherwise would be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule would be explicitly excluded from regulation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Engines used to propel marine ``vessels'' as such term is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). EPA is not including these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines because they are currently subject to safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations by the U.S. Coast Guard (See 46 U.S.C. 331 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46 U.S.C. 4302.), and EPA is developing a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking which will propose appropriate methods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulating emissions from these engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Engines regulated by the Mining Safety and Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration (MSHA) for underground use. EPA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including in this proposal engines that are used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underground mining or engines used in underground mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment as regulated by MSHA under the authority of 30 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts 7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. MSHA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for protecting miners from unhealthy levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air pollution in underground mines and has issued air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality standards for mines and standards for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from some types of mining equipment. Although EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered applying EPA regulations to these engines, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chose not to include them at this time in order to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dual regulation of these engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart E. EPA has regulated emissions from motorcycles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since 1978. A motorcycle means any motor vehicle with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlight, taillight, and stoplight and having two wheels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three wheels and a curb mass less than or equal to 680 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kilograms.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 87.1(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Engines used in recreational vehicles which are defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: (1) The engine has no installed speed governor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the engine's rated speed is greater than or equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 RPM; (3) the engine is not used for the propulsion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a marine vessel; and (4) the engine does not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this regulation. Recreational vehicles include: All-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrain vehicles, off-road motorcycles, snowmobiles, and go-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
karts. These engines are being excluded for several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons: First, the duty cycle is completely different from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most small SI engine applications. These engines experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly transient operation and likely will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completely different test procedures for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control testing. Second, they are designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasize power output; thus, they are typically designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run at much higher RPMs than other small SI engines. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on other criteria which may be utilized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defining the class of nonroad engines which propel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational vehicles.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Exclusions and Exemptions to Today's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 203(b)(1) of the CAA, the Agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing additional categories of exemptions from new small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine regulation similar to the exclusions and exemptions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist for on-highway engines and that have been proposed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad large CI engine rule. These include exemptions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, or for reasons of national security. Exemptions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be obtained either categorically, that is without application to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator, or by submitting a written application to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator. Export exemptions and manufacturer-owned engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions would be granted without application. Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions, display exemptions, and national security exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be obtained by application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclusions from this regulation include nonroad engines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used solely for competition or for combat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exemptions and exclusions are justified in these cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the sources are limited in number or scope, so minimal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental harm results; the particular use of the source is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to further air quality research; and/or the exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is vital to the security of the nation. (See 39 FR 10601, March 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21, 1974.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Effective Date for Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that certification of new small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin in 1996. Manufacturers of engines produced on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 1, 1996, would be required to obtain from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator a certificate of conformity covering the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. The certificate would be obtained prior to selling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering for sale, introducing into commerce, or importing into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States the new engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the small SI engines affected by this proposal include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a broad range of engine types, EPA believes that the effective

The emission standards being proposed for this Phase 1 small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine regulation are listed in Table 1 in the Overview Section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed emission standards result in significant emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in the near term while work is going on to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more stringent Phase 2 standards and while manufacturers work to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design engines and equipment capable of meeting lower standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes these proposed emission standards represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the greatest emission reductions achievable given the short lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time prior to this rule's effective date and the technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available during this period. Requiring more stringent Phase 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards than those proposed today would necessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay implementation of new small SI engine standards by at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two years. This additional lead time would be needed to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers time to redesign engines and equipment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate requirements of more sophisticated technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air quality benefits which will accrue under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards are large and meet the statutory criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad standards required by the CAA. These benefits are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in Section VI of this preamble.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the appropriate level of emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to propose, EPA initially considered, as required in the CAA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable motor vehicle standards. Due to technological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constraints present in small engines, EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgating emission standards comparable with motor vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in a Phase 1 rule is not technologically achievable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See chapter 1 of the draft RSD for further discussion of small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine technological constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing these emission standards, EPA has also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered potential safety and noise issues. Of concern is 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 261.52 which directs the Forest Service to prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation or use of any handheld internal or external combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine without a spark-arresting device properly installed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained, and in effective working order. The Forest Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also requires that multipositional small engines used on federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
park lands have exposed exhaust system surface temperatures not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 550 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. Exhaust gas temperatures may not exceed 475 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of engine changes EPA expects as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed emission standards will not present a safety concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only catalytic converters designed to produce high conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies can generate sufficient exotherms to raise exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system skin temperatures to a level that might present a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem. Manufacturers have indicated that they will not use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic converters to meet the proposed emission standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most product lines. EPA estimates that up to 30 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines in Class I may need low efficiency catalysts to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. However, one manufacturer stated that the exotherm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by these low efficiency catalysts will not affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust system skin temperatures sufficiently to warrant more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advanced heat dissipation and heat shield technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noise levels of small SI engines will not be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase as a result of the proposed emission standards. The type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engine changes EPA expects to see among current engine designs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the proposed emission standards are not expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact noise levels. The primary source of noise from nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small engines originates from combustion and the moving parts in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the engine, such as the piston, valve train, and so forth. Noise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from combustion is controlled primarily through the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
muffler. EPA believes the principal method to be used by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine manufacturers to meet the proposed emission regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be leaner air/fuel ratios. Noise levels in future engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which meet the proposed regulations must, therefore, not exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of current production engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the possible impact of this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation on both engine noise and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In EPA's judgment, section 213(a)(3)'s requirement that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate emissions from those classes or categories of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engines which cause, or contribute to concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone in nonattainment areas allows EPA to set emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for HC, rather than VOCs in general, as EPA believes that HC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from small gasoline engines are those that cause or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to ozone nonattainment concentrations. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulating HC rather that VOCs would be consistent with on-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highway practice. EPA requests comment on this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Nonroad Study, EPA described VOCs as any compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing carbon and hydrogen or containing carbon and hydrogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in combination with any other element which has a vapor pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1.5 pounds per square inch absolute or greater under actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCs contain both hydrogen atoms and carbon atoms but no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other atoms and are a subset of VOCs. For small SI engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on engines tested by Southwest Research Institute under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with EPA, HCs make up more than 99 percent of the VOCs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitted from these engines. Less than one percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured VOC emissions are from constituents other than HC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions (aldehydes and ketones were the measured non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbon constituents in this case). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the types of emission controls employed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce HC emissions also reduce emissions of non-hydrocarbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOCs. Therefore, in the case of small SI engines, setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limits for HC emission accomplishes essentially the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall reduction in VOC emission as would setting emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits for VOCs. Of course reductions in the individual non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbon VOC species varies, as does the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbon species.

5. Engine Classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The category of small SI engines is very complex and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprises a wide range of engines used in a broad spectrum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. EPA proposes to adopt a ``class'' structure for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 1 regulation. In determining which class of emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards a particular engine must meet, an engine's end use or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application must be determined. This rule proposes two broad use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories_nonhandheld and handheld. Nonhandheld engines would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be required to meet either Class I or Class II standards while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld engines would have to meet either Class III, IV, or V 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards. Once the applicable use category is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined, the engine class would be selected on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine displacement as measured in cubic centimeters (cc). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each engine class would have unique emission standards. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing five engine classes: Class I_small nonhandheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines less than 225 cc in displacement; Class II_small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement; Class III_small handheld engines less than 20 cc 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in displacement; Class IV_small handheld engines equal to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than 20 cc to less than 50 cc in displacement; Class V_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small handheld engines equal to or greater than 50 cc in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Class I engines are overwhelmingly found in lawnmowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class II engines primarily include engines used in generator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sets, garden tractors, and commercial lawn and garden equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only engines used in equipment defined as handheld would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to meet Class III, IV, or V emission standards. Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III includes engines used in consumer handheld products, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small string trimmers, edgers, and brush cutters. Class IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompasses engines used in both residential and commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings and includes large trimmers, edgers, blowers, and chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saws. Class V includes a majority of engines utilized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial chain saws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing five separate engine classes based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of factors. First, some types of equipment are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered exclusively by 2-stroke engines. EPA estimates that as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much as 90 percent of 2-stroke engines are utilized in handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. These current handheld 2-stroke engines incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a technology which is inherently more polluting than current 4-stroke engine technology and which results in 2-stroke
engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiencing a higher concentration of hydrocarbons in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust. EPA's view is that it is not technologically feasible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to apply the nonhandheld Class I and II engine standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld engines in this Phase 1 rule; therefore the need arises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Class III, IV, and V handheld engine standards. Differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in stringency between classes III, IV, and V are due to the fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that energy-specific emissions generally increase as engine size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreases. This principle is also true in the case of engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in nonhandheld applications and meeting emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of either classes I or II. See discussion in the draft RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the engine classification approach for Phase 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonizes federal small engine regulations with California's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lawn and garden regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, it is EPA's view that the emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed today for handheld and nonhandheld engines and reflected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the five engine class categories represent the greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction achievable for this Phase 1 rule.

6. Handheld Engine Qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To qualify as a handheld engine under this proposal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small SI engine would be required to meet at least one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following three requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried by the operator throughout the performance of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended function(s). This is meant to encompass such equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as lightweight leafblowers, trimmers (both string and hedge), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must operate multipositionally, such as upside down and sideways, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to complete its intended function(s). EPA intends this category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include all types of chain saws as well as items already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in the first requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the combined engine and equipment dry weight is under 14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kilograms, no more than two wheels are present, and at least one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the following attributes is also present: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The operator must alternately provide support or carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment throughout the performance of its intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function(s). This allows lightweight snowblowers that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried up stairs, or edgers which are picked up and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported during operation to qualify for handheld status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The operator must provide support or attitudinal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control for the equipment throughout the performance of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended function(s). This attribute will allow equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as lightweight tillers, augers, cutoff/concrete saws, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and edgers to qualify for handheld status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The engine is used exclusively in a hand-portable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generator or pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this section ``support'' would mean that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator holds the equipment in position so as to prevent it from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falling, slipping, or sinking. It would not be necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire weight of the equipment to be borne by the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Attitudinal control'' would mean that the operator regulates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the horizontal or vertical position of the equipment, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both. ``Carry'' would mean that the operator completely bears the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight of the equipment, including the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section ``V.G. Definition of Handheld Engines'' provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional discussion on this issue. EPA believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed handheld definition adequately covers those categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engines which should be allowed to meet the less stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld engine standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests information regarding specific engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications which are not clearly identifiable as handheld or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld under the proposed definition. EPA also requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative language which could be incorporated in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition to clarify the distinction between handheld and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld. EPA is particularly concerned that manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-stroke lawnmowers may attempt to qualify for handheld status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing the second requirement_multiposition operation. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not EPA's intent that pushing a lawnmower up and down hills would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify as multiposition operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7. Standards for Classes I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to adopt one of two options under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration for setting standards applicable to Class I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. EPA requests comments on each of these options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase 1 would adopt a combined HC + NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for engine classes I and II. While engines in classes I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have high HC emission rates, most currently produce extremely low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Due to technological constraints of all small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, HC reductions would generally come at the expense of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. See ``VII. Technology Assessment'' for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of this phenomenon. However, the resultant overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission inventories would be slight relative to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 produced by sources such as nonroad large CI engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sensitivity of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions to HC control varies greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between engine designs. EPA believes that a Phase 1 approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which allows incremental tradeoffs between HC and NO

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a combined standard would be consistent with EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory mandate that nonroad engine emission standards reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the greatest emission reductions achievable. See ``VII. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technology Assessment'' for further discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet the combined standard, a manufacturer would add its

 test result. This combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number would then be submitted to EPA. Individual levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these pollutants would not be established. The manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also be required to meet this combined level during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator testing and the SEA enforcement program. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that this approach would be workable for a Phase 1 rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is reluctant to set such a combined standard because it is extremely concerned that no precedent be set for promulgating
combined emission standards in future rulemakings. EPA's past practice has been to set separate pollutant standards.
EPA is considering the combined standard approach only for this Phase 1 small SI engine rule because of limited data
availability, the aggressive timeframe of this rule, and to harmonize with the California lawn and garden regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under this option EPA would set separate Class I and II emission levels for HC and NOx. Based on information currently
available to EPA, the NOx standard would be approximately 136 percent higher than current new engine levels, while
the HC standard would be approximately equal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between those levels and the HC + NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards proposed in option 1. EPA requests comment on this specific option, including industry data which addresses
the appropriate level of both HC and NOx if separate standards were to be promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Engine Family Categorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of demonstrating emission compliance, EPA is proposing that manufacturers of small SI engines divide
their product line into groups of engines, called engine families, which are composed of engines having similar emission
characteristics. Small SI engine families would be determined by using the same criteria (type of fuel, method of
air aspiration, number of cylinders, and so forth) currently used to define on-highway motorcycle engine families.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be placed in the same engine family, engines would be required to be identical in all the following applicable respects:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Combustion cycle, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cooling mechanism, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The cylinder configuration (inline, vee, opposed bore spacings, and so forth), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The number of cylinders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The engine class, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The number of catalytic converters (location, volume, and composition), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The thermal reactor characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the manufacturer's option, engines identical in all the above respects could be further divided into different
engine families if the Administrator determined that such engines were expected to have different emission characteristics.
This determination would be based on a number of features, such as the intake and exhaust valve or port size, the fuel
system, exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, and method of air aspiration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the appropriateness of adding governed engine RPM range as a criterion for the determination
of an engine family. EPA is concerned that a wide-governed RPM spread in the same engine family, that is one engine configuration
has a no-load governed speed at 3,200 RPM and another engine configuration has a rated no-load governed speed of 2,200
RPM, may be a sufficient reason to break up one engine family into more than one engine family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Compliance With Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The test engine(s) representing an engine family would be required to demonstrate that emissions are less than or
equal to each separate emission standard. If a test engine exceeded any one emission standard in the applicable class,
the engine family would be deemed not in compliance with emission standards of that class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that if catalysts are used in an engine family to meet the emission standards of this regulation, the
engine manufacturer must affirm that the durability of the catalysts has been confirmed on the basis of the evaluation
procedure that is specified in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Useful Life Period, In-use Enforcement, and Development of an In-use Testing Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is not proposing a small SI engine useful life period or an in-use enforcement program in today's proposal. However,
EPA believes that a critical element in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines
that continue to meet emission standards throughout the engine's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life. While section 213(d) of the CAA authorizes EPA to enforce emission standards in-use, EPA is proposing
to postpone setting a useful life period and an in-use enforcement program for small SI engines until the Phase 2 regulations
become effective and, instead, to require in this Phase 1 regulation that manufacturers test in-use engines. The
Phase 2 rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for small SI engines is under a court-ordered deadline and must be promulgated by April 30, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not proposing a Phase 1 useful life period for several reasons. Only limited testing data is currently available
on in-use performance of small SI engines. Additional data would be provided by the in-use testing program described
below. Second, EPA does not believe that emission controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for Phase 1 will experience significant deterioration beyond normal engine deterioration, although this
area needs more research. For further discussion of these issues see ``V.P. Applicability of In-Use Standards''
and ``V.Q. In-Use Testing Requirements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed in-use testing requirement is intended to parallel in-use testing previously or currently conducted
by industry. While manufacturers and their associations have proposed that EPA adopt a cooperative testing program,
EPA believes cooperative programs would not adequately or as effectively achieve the goals of this in-use program.
See ``V.Q. In-Use Testing Requirements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that engine manufacturers test a sample of in-use engines. In the absence of in-use emission standards,
EPA believes this testing requirement would be invaluable for manufacturers and EPA to learn about in-use emissions
and emission deterioration. Although EPA would not enforce in-use emission standards for Phase 1 engines, EPA expects
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers would take appropriate actions to prevent recurrence of in-use noncompliance and to also remedy in-use
noncompliance when it was discovered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of certification the engine manufacturer would propose which engine families are to be included in the
in-use test program. The certificate of conformity issued by EPA for engine families included in the in-use testing
program would be conditional based on completion of the test program for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. EPA would approve a manufacturer's test program if the selected engine families represented an adequate
consideration of the elements discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Number of engines to be tested:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The number of small SI engines to be tested by a manufacturer would be determined by the following method: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For an engine manufacturer with total projected annual production of more than 75,000 small SI engines, the minimum
number of engines to be tested will be the lowest of the numbers determined in (1), (2), or (3) below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Divide the manufacturer's total projected annual production of small SI engines by 50,000, and round to the nearest
whole number, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Test five engines each from 25 percent of all small SI engine families certified in that model year,

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Test three engines each from 50 percent of all small SI engine families certified in that model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An engine manufacturer with total projected annual production of 75,000 small SI engines or less must test a minimum
of two engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for selecting test engines:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An engine manufacturer would be required to select test engines from engine families utilizing the following criteria
and in the order specified: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Engine families using emission technology which may be used on phase 2 engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Engine families using aftertreatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Engine families certified to different emission standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Different engine designs (such as side valve versus overhead valve engines), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Engine families using emission control technology specifically installed to achieve compliance with Phase
1 standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The engine family with the highest projected annual sales, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Engine families which meet the above criteria, but have not been included in prior model year in-use testing programs
as required by these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collection and testing of in-use engines:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An engine manufacturer would be required to procure in-use engines which have been operated for between half and three-quarters
of the engine's advertised (or projected) useful life. All testing would be completed within three years after the
certificate is issued or is effective, whichever is later, for an engine family which requires in-use testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A test engine would be procured from sources not associated with the engine manufacturer or equipment manufacturer,
except that, with prior approval of the Administrator, an engine manufacturer with annual sales of less than 50,000
engines might obtain in-use engines associated with itself or its equipment manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A test engine would be required to have a maintenance history representative of actual in-use conditions. To comply
with this requirement a manufacturer would question the end user regarding the accumulated usage, maintenance,
operating conditions, and storage of the test engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer would perform minimal set-to-spec maintenance on a test engine. Maintenance would include only
what is listed in the owner's instructions for engines with the amount of service and age of the acquired test engine.
One valid emission test would be required for each in-use engine. Finally, if a selected in-use engine failed to comply
with any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification emission standards, the manufacturer would be responsible for determining the reason for noncompliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In-use test program reporting requirements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The manufacturer would be required to submit to the Administrator by January 30 of each calendar year all emission
testing results generated from the in-use testing program. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator's request, a manufacturer would be required to provide documents used in the procurement process,
including criteria used in the procurement screening process and information from the end user(s) related to use,
maintenance, and storage of the selected engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that engine manufacturers may have near-term concerns regarding testing capacity and the burden this
type of program may impose on a newly regulated industry. EPA requests comments on the lack of in-use standards, the
lack of in-use enforcement, all elements of this proposed testing requirement, and on possible alternative designs
of in-use testing programs (such as a joint program between manufacturers and EPA) or enforcement that may be more
effective, giving consideration to the limited lead time and duration of the Phase 1 program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Certificate of Conformity, Requirements of Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any manufacturer of a small SI engine would be responsible for obtaining from the Administrator a certificate of conformity
covering any engine introduced into commerce in the United States, before such an engine is sold, offered for sale,
introduced or delivered for introduction into commerce, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 203 of the CAA does not prohibit the production of vehicles or engines before a certificate of conformity is
issued. Vehicles or engines produced prior to the effective date of a certificate of conformity might also be covered
by the certificate if the following conditions were met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The engine conformed in all respects to the engines described in the application for the certificate of conformity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The vehicles or engines were not sold, offered for sale, introduced into commerce, or delivered for introduction
into commerce prior to the effective date of the certificate of conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Agency was notified prior to the beginning of production when such production would start, and the Agency
was provided full opportunity to inspect and/or test the engines during and after their production. For example,
the Agency would have the opportunity to conduct SEA production line testing as if the engines had been produced after
the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that a number of requirements be met by the engine manufacturer prior to granting a certificate of
conformity. As is the case for on-highway vehicles and engines, the proposed regulations would make it illegal for
any person to use a device on a nonroad engine which senses operation outside normal emission test conditions and reduces
the ability of the emission control system to control the engine's emissions. To guard against use of these devices,
EPA would reserve the right to require testing of a certification test engine over a modified test procedure if EPA
suspected a defeat device was being used by an engine manufacturer on a particular engine. In addition, use of defeat
devices would be considered a prohibited act subject to civil penalties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Engines equipped with adjustable operating parameters would have to comply with all the regulations with the parameters
adjusted to any setting in the full range of adjustment. For example, this could include adjustment of the high-speed
needle for alteration of the air/fuel ratio or adjustment of the speed set screw. This would ensure that changes to
the adjustable operating parameters that might readily occur in use would not cause the engine to fail to comply with
these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to require that manufacturers label each engine and that the label meet the same requirements with
respect to durability and visibility as required in the current on-highway program. The engine manufacturer would
be responsible for proper labeling of engines from each engine family. In addition, EPA is proposing labeling requirements
for vehicle and equipment manufacturers if the engine label is obscured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing that each engine must have a unique
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 engine identification number which may be part of the engine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 label or engraved on the engine. Such identification is
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 necessary for tracking individual engines. Use of engine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 identification numbers would facilitate setting up a tracking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 system and allow manufacturers to sample in-use engines for their
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 programs. This identification would be essential for development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of a long-term in-use durability program. EPA requests comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 on the labeling proposal as well as on current engine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 identification practices within the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA also proposes to require that all engine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 crankcases must be closed to preclude the emissions that occur
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 when a crankcase is vented to the atmosphere. Since most
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 currently produced engines do have closed crankcases, EPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 believes this requirement would impact relatively few
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 manufacturers. Finally, small SI engine noise levels would not
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 be allowed to increase as a result of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on these proposed certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirements. While EPA is today proposing vehicle and equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 manufacturer labeling responsibilities, EPA is considering
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 whether to instead make engine manufacturers responsible for
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ensuring that the emission control label is visible once the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 certified engine is incorporated into a given piece of nonroad
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 equipment. EPA requests comment on this specific issue as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

12. Vehicle/Equipment Manufacturer Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commencing on this rule's effective date, manufacturers of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 small SI vehicles and equipment and importers would be prohibited
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 from introducing into U.S. commerce any vehicle or equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 powered by a small SI engine which does not incorporate the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 appropriate certified handheld or nonhandheld engine. Failure to
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 do so would make the equipment manufacturer liable for the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 assessment of civil penalties. EPA is proposing this requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 because it is concerned that engines certified to meet handheld
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 engine standards may in fact be used in nonhandheld equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This would significantly and negatively impact air quality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 benefits which are to accrue as a result of this rule. Due to
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the potential for engines in different categories to be
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 substituted for one another, this prohibition would ensure that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the regulated engines are used in appropriate applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, EPA is proposing to require that the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 original emission control engine label is visible once the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 certified engine is placed in the vehicle or equipment. If the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 engine label is obscured as a result of the vehicle or equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 manufacturer's placement of the engine in the nonroad vehicle or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 equipment, the vehicle or equipment manufacturer would be
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 required to attach an identical but supplemental label, in a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 readily visible location on a part necessary for normal vehicle
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 or equipment operation before it is introduced into United States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213 gives EPA the authority to require nonroad
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 equipment manufacturers to use certified nonroad engines. For
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 further discussion, see ``V.F. Nonroad Engine and Vehicle
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Definitions.''

13. Certification Procedures_Application Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The engine manufacturer would be required to submit an
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 application to EPA requesting a certificate of conformity for
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 each engine family for every model or calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Certificates would be issued to cover production for a single
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 model year. See ``V. W. Duration of Certificates of Conformity,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Definition of Model Year, Annual Production Period'' for further
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discussion of these issues. An application for a certificate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 would be submitted every model year even when the engine family
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 does not change from the previous certificate, although
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 representative test data could be reused in the succeeding model
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 year's application. If the emissions from the test engine were
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 below the applicable standards and EPA believed that all other
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirements of the regulation were met, EPA would issue a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 certificate of conformity for that engine family.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application would need to provide EPA with sufficient
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 information to determine the appropriate test results and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 emission characteristics of the engine family. It would also
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 allow EPA to determine test engine compliance with the applicable
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 emission standards in a timely manner. It would be important that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the engine manufacturer succinctly, fully, and accurately submit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 all pertinent information to EPA and maintain internal records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 which could be easily accessed if such access is determined to be
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 necessary by EPA.

If changes to an engine family configuration occur after the application is submitted which cause the changed version
to be the engine family's worst case emitter, then emission testing of the changed version is required. Additionally,
the Administrator may require a manufacturer to conduct testing to demonstrate compliance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that the emission level used to certify an engine family be equal to the highest emission test level
reported for any engine configuration in that family. The engine manufacturer would be responsible for selecting
and testing one engine from each engine family which is most likely to be that engine family's worst case emitter. The
criterion for selecting the worst case engine would be that engine configuration which has the highest weighted brake-specific
fuel consumption over the appropriate engine test cycle. EPA could verify the test results by requiring Administrator
testing of this engine. EPA would also have the option to test any available test engine representing other configurations
in the engine family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before emission testing was carried out, the manufacturer would perform service accumulation on each test engine
over the dynamometer hour accumulation cycle of its choice based on good engineering practices (for example, a cycle
representative of typical ``break-in'' operation of a new production engine in actual use). For each engine family,
the manufacturer would determine the number of hours required to stabilize the emissions of the test engine. However,
the number of hours which the manufacturer chose could not exceed 12 hours. EPA does not believe a break-in time greater
that 12 hours is necessary to stabilize new engine emissions. In addition, this cutoff is necessary to ensure that
EPA gets an equitable view of stabilized emissions over all engine families which may vary with respect to HC and CO
emission degradation and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission improvement with time. The manufacturer would maintain, and provide in its application to the Administrator,
a record of the rationale used both in making the dynamometer cycle selection and in making the service accumulation
hours determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The manufacturer would be required to conduct emission tests of selected engine(s) using the proposed test procedure
discussed herein. Finally, the proposed rule does provide for Administrator approval of special test procedures
if the small SI engine is not capable of being satisfactorily tested under the proposed test procedures.

EPA is proposing a single test procedure with three different test cycles for measuring HC, CO, and NO

. One cycle would be for all Class III, IV, and V engines (Cycle C), while two cycles would be possible for Class I and II
engines (Cycles A and B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cycle B would only be used for those Class I and II engine families in which 100 percent of the engines were sold with a
governor which maintained engine speed within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 two percent of rated speed (rated speed means the speed at which the manufacturer specifies the maximum rated power
of an engine) under all operating conditions. Cycle B would be a 6-mode steady state cycle consisting of five power
modes at rated speed and one no-load mode at idle speed. For all other Class I and II engines, the test cycle to be used
would be Cycle A. Cycle A would be identical to Cycle B, except the five power modes would be run at intermediate engine
speed (intermediate speed is defined as 85 percent of rated speed). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Class III, IV, and V engines, the engine manufacturer would be required to use Cycle C. Cycle C is a 2-mode steady
state cycle consisting of one power mode (at rated speed) and one no-load mode at idle speed. The test modes for each
cycle would be run in a prescribed order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three test cycles (modes and power settings) documented in the proposed regulations are based on work performed
by the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE) Small Engine Committee. The SAE Small Engine Committee has published
a recommended practice for measuring gaseous exhaust emissions from small utility engines typically less than 20
kW. This recommended procedure is known as SAE J1088. Test Cycles A, B, and C are all taken from J1088. The mode weighting
factors are taken from work performed by CARB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has published recommended test cycles for measuring
exhaust emissions from reciprocating internal combustion engines. Recommended exhaust gas measurement procedures
and test cycles for reciprocating internal combustion engines are contained in ISO 8178, Part 4. ISO has three test
cycles for spark-ignition engines less than 20 kW termed G1, G2, and G3 which are identical to SAE Cycles A, B, and C,
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the proposed test procedures are adequate for the proposed emission standards. The purpose of a certification
test procedure is to adequately represent the emission levels produced by the test engine when it is used in actual
operation. The test procedure in this proposed rule does this. The 6-mode test cycles (Cycle A and Cycle B) used for
Class I and II engines and the 2-mode cycle (Cycle C) used for Class III, IV, and V engines were developed by the Society
of Automotive Engineer's Small Engine Committee to cover the broad range of engine operating conditions seen by small
engines. The weighting factors were developed by CARB using data supplied by the small engine industry. The weighting
factors are intended to be representative of the modes (speed and power conditions) used by the broad range of small
gasoline engines. The Agency believes these weighting factors are sufficient for this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methods used to measure the gaseous emissions of HC, CO, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for all small engines would be independent of the type of engine and test cycle. EPA proposes to allow manufacturers
to sample emissions using either the Raw Gas Method (raw) or the Constant Volume Sampling Method (CVS). Using either
method, each test engine would be stabilized at each mode before emission measurement began. After stabilizing the
power output during each mode, the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, and fuel flow would be determined.
The measured values would be weighted and then used to calculate the grams of exhaust pollutant emitted per kilowatt-hour.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAE J1088 contains a recommended procedure for the measurement of gaseous emissions using the Raw Gas Method. A recommended
testing procedure, such as SAE J1088 or ISO 8178, by definition allows sufficient flexibility for individual manufacturers
to develop unique features in their test procedures while still being within the allowable guidance. This flexibility
is not a desirable feature in a regulatory program where both manufacturers and EPA want to ensure uniformity between
test labs, since conformity and compliance testing decisions are binding on the parties involved. For this reason,
the test procedures proposed by EPA are not identical to SAE J1088 or ISO 8178, but are compatible with those procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA understands the importance of compatibility between the EPA proposed test procedures and those used to demonstrate
emission compliance for other regulatory agencies within the U.S. and throughout the world. Compatibility allows
a manufacturer to exercise the cost efficiencies of using one engine configuration to demonstrate emission compliance
in more than one market. EPA has tried to establish a test procedure that is compatible with both CARB's utility engine
test procedure and with ISO 8178. As a result, EPA expects that a manufacturer using the resultant EPA procedure would
also meet the CARB and ISO requirements. However, since the SAE and ISO procedures are recommended practices and do
not have stringent test parameter tolerances, a manufacturer using the SAE or ISO procedure may or may not meet EPA
requirements.

16. Administrator Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing Administrator testing provisions that allow EPA flexibility in determining when and where engine
testing may occur. This is necessary given EPA's limited testing facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, this provision would allow EPA to require test engine testing at any given location, including at a
manufacturer's facility. The Administrator would be empowered to require the manufacturer to make available such
instrumentation and equipment that was specified by the Administrator. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's
facility would be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible. Authorized EPA personnel would be given
access to the facilities to observe such testing.

17. Catalyst Durability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA expects the emission controls used to meet the exhaust emission standards specified in this rulemaking to be durable
so that emission reduction benefits are realized not only when the engines are new, but also during operation in-use,
over time. Although EPA is not proposing full emission control system durability demonstration requirements in
this notice, manufacturers are fully expected to design such systems to be effective under normal in-use operating
conditions over time. Full emission control system durability demonstration requirements are expected to be included
in the Phase 2 regulations for small SI engines. However, EPA has concerns that certain emission control components,
namely catalysts, warrant separate consideration. Therefore, EPA is proposing durability demonstration requirements
for catalysts in this notice as discussed in greater detail in ``V. U. Catalyst Durability.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule's information retention requirements are similar to those proposed in the nonroad large CI rule. EPA believes
that the proposed information requirements are sufficient to adequately determine compliance with this regulation
and the appropriateness of awarding a certificate of conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer would be responsible for retaining certain information applicable to each test engine along with
copies of the submitted applications for individual certificates of conformity. A manufacturer would also be required
to submit an amendment(s) to the application or certificate of conformity whenever additional small SI engines were
added to an engine family or changes were made to a product line covered by a certificate of conformity. Notification
normally would occur prior to either producing such engines or making such changes to a product line.

19. Selective Enforcement Auditing Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to conduct a Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program of small SI engines as authorized by section
213 of the CAA. The small engine SEA program would be an emission compliance program for new production small SI engines
in which manufacturers would be required to test engines as they leave the assembly line, with EPA oversight. Through
SEA testing, EPA could determine with reasonable statistical certainty whether or not tested engine families were
in compliance with the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that an SEA program is necessary to verify that production engines comply with applicable regulations.
Since certification would be based on preproduction prototype engines which often contain specially built and installed
components, production engines could still fail to meet emission standards if quality control was inadequate. SEAs
would provide a means to test actual production engines as they came off the assembly line. Since no in-use enforcement
program is being proposed for small SI engines, SEA provides the only opportunity for EPA to determine the compliance
of production engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would assign a limit to the number of SEAs each manufacturer could receive during a model year. As in the on-highway
SEA program, this annual limit would be used to provide assurance to manufacturers that EPA would not significantly
overburden a manufacturer with an unreasonable number of audits during the model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each SEA would be an audit of one engine family, and each passing audit would count toward the manufacturer's annual
limit. EPA is proposing an annual limit of two for each manufacturer with projected annual production of less than
100,000 engines. For manufacturers with annual production of 100,000 or more engines the annual limit would be the
greater of either two or the number determined by dividing the number of engine families certified in that model year
by five, and rounding to the nearest whole number. For example, a manufacturer with a projected annual United States
production of 600,000 engines with 13 certified engine families would have an annual limit of three, and a manufacturer
with a projected annual production of 300,000 small SI engines and 22 engine families would have an annual limit of
four.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes this method of determining annual limits is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most appropriate for the small SI engine industry. EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing the minimum annual limit of two because manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may change production during the model year. If a manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passed an SEA early in a model year, the manufacturer might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently implement changes in its production process which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could increase engine emissions. With an annual limit of two, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would have the flexibility to audit a manufacturer early in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the model year, and then return later in the model year if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer implemented a change in production which could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase engine emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, EPA is also proposing that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with projected annual production of 100,000 small SI engines or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more may have an annual limit of more than two. EPA believes it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be necessary to conduct more than two SEAs on larger engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers when they have a large variety of engine families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When manufacturers have a variety of engine families, an SEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might only check a small portion of the manufacturers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. Therefore, by dividing the number of engine families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified by larger manufacturers by five, EPA could establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher annual limit for those manufacturers with a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine families with different emission characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers with lower production should be assured that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not overburden its limited test facilities with SEAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual limits would act as a cap and would not necessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the actual number of audits a manufacturer received. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not exceed a manufacturer's annual limit unless the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had reason to believe noncompliance was occurring. EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the proposed method for determining annual limits. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SEA program strives to encourage manufacturers to perform self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditing and promptly remedy the emission noncompliance it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovers. Therefore, EPA would consider reducing the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits conducted by the Agency, minimizing audits of engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families which are unusually burdensome to audit, or both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options, if the manufacturer provided substantial data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate conformity of actual production engines with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable emission standards. EPA suggests that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfamiliar with self-auditing review existing on-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, such as CARB's Quality Audit Program or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers' Assembly Line Test Data, for guidance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing an in-house auditing program. Examples of audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs are available in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would review self-audit data and procedures used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquiring the data to assess the validity and representativeness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each manufacturer's self-audit program. The primary criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would use in evaluating the in-house programs are sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size, randomness within the family of the audited engine(s), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of testing, and the applicable required test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. EPA would discount the value of any self-audit data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the Agency received indications of noncompliance or concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the data were invalid, incomplete, unrepresentative, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient. In addition, manufacturers with a comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-audit program would be subject to spot checks with EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversight to provide EPA assurance of compliance. EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers would be notified of an SEA by means of a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. This test order would specify the engine family to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audited. EPA might also specify an engine configuration or range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of configurations from a family to be audited. However, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reserve the option to select all configurations within an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine family for an SEA. To minimize the burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, EPA would consider requests by manufacturers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude particular engines or engine configurations from a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample. Justification for such requests could be to avoid a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay in shipment of urgent customer-ordered engines or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize test cell set-up time by selecting engines of similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical configurations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test orders would include information relevant to the SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test order would indicate any specific procedures, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time to begin selecting engines, during the course of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit. Additionally, the test order would authorize EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement officers, upon presentation of enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credentials, to inspect engine production, test facilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage facilities, and records necessary to establish compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with nonroad regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to differences between the small SI industry and the on-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highway industry, EPA is proposing that some aspects of the on-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highway SEA program be modified for small SI engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, on-highway engine SEAs have been conducted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine configurations: a specific engine family, an engine code, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rated speed and an emission control system. EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making an entire small engine family subject to an audit would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead manufacturers to use extra care when grouping engines in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. Consequently, EPA is proposing that nonroad SEAs be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted by sampling engines from within an engine family. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on this aspect of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SEA engines would typically be selected from a point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final engine assembly or from a storage or shipping facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most often, this selection point would be at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine assembly line, where no further quality control procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
happen or parts would be installed on the engines. Selection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported engines could occur at a port of entry. SEA engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could not receive any additional inspections or quality control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than that of normal production engines and pre-test safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks. Engines would be tested in the same order as they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected. EPA requests comment on the feasibility of selecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, then removing the engine for audit testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to include ports of entry or storage locations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States as locations for EPA selection of foreign- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced small SI engines for SEA emission testing at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories in the United States. The location of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selections could be designated by the manufacturer to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disruption and shipping costs. The manufacturer would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for ensuring that a test facility in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States was available for SEA testing.

``Port selection'' would assist the Agency in reducing its travel costs. Recently, in the on-highway program, EPA
has had requests from light-duty vehicle manufacturers to conduct port selection during SEAs. These audits were
performed and ran smoothly. EPA might permit reasonable maintenance and inspections of port-selected engines to
address problems that could result from long-term storage, ocean shipping, or repeated handling. EPA requests comments
on the port selection aspect of the SEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to testing SEA engines, manufacturers could operate engines to break in engine components. This break-in or
service accumulation of an SEA engine family would follow the same procedures and could be up to 12 hours or the same
number of break-in hours accumulated for that family's emission data engine during certification. Service accumulation
would be performed expeditiously and in a manner using good engineering judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Audit engines would be tested using the same test cycle, either Test Cycle A, B, or C, as was used in certification; however,
deviations allowed in certification from the full test procedures as described in proposed 40 CFR part 90 would not
be permitted in SEAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that small SI engines will be selected for SEA testing at a rate of at least four engines per day, unless
production is less than four engines per day. To minimize delays in shipment of engines to customers, manufacturers
could test the first engines selected for an audit while additional engines were produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total number of engines tested in an SEA would be dictated by the number of engines required to reach the statistically
acceptable pass/fail decision within the sampling plan applied. EPA is proposing a sequential sampling plan for
small SI engine SEAs. These sampling plans have been designed to meet a 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) and
to ensure low statistical risks of incorrect pass/fail determinations. The maximum theoretical percentage of failing
engines for passing an SEA is 40 percent. EPA is proposing a 40 percent AQL for the small SI engine SEA program. EPA has
used this AQL since the 1970s for the on-highway program, and EPA currently has no reason to propose a different AQL
for a nonroad program. EPA is proposing that the small SI engine SEA program use the same sampling plans used for the
on-highway heavy-duty engine SEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes that engine manufacturers with projected United States annual sales of 7,500 or greater must complete
a minimum of two engine tests per day during an SEA. Engine manufacturers with projected United States annual sales
of less than 7,500 would be required to complete a minimum of one engine test per day during an SEA. A valid emission test
or a voided test would each count as one test toward meeting the requirement. EPA requests comments on this aspect of
the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A test engine's pass or fail determination would be made by comparing final test results to the applicable federal
emission standard. Within five working days of the conclusion of an audit, manufacturers would be required to submit
a report to EPA summarizing engine test results, test procedures, and audit events such as the date, time, and location
of each test, repairs to engines, and the reason for the repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure of an SEA could result in suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that family. To have
the certificate reinstated subsequent to a suspension, or reissued subsequent to a revocation, the manufacturer
would be required to demonstrate, by showing passing data, that improvements, modifications, or replacement had
brought the family into compliance. The proposed regulations include hearing provisions which allow the manufacturer
to challenge EPA's suspension or revocation decision based on application of the sampling plans or the manner in which
tests were conducted.

20. Importation of Nonconforming Small SI Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing certain restrictions on the importation of nonconforming small SI engines. Such restrictions are
based in part on the existing regulations for the importation of nonconforming motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA provides for an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) program for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines,
EPA is not certain that an ICI program is necessary or practical for small SI engines. For the on-highway program, ICIs
are responsible for all aspects of compliance required of manufacturers (e.g., certification, testing, labeling,
warranty, recall, maintaining records). EPA solicits comment on the need for an ICI program for small SI engines.
Due to the uncertainty about the need for an ICI program, EPA is proposing in the alternative both to have an ICI program
that parallels that of the on-highway program, and to have no ICI program in the final rule. EPA currently favors no
ICI program for small SI engines; if the Agency determines not to promulgate an ICI program, the proposed regulatory
language will be deleted from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal includes a special provision for individuals to import a limited number of nonconforming small SI engines
for personal use. EPA expects that individuals may not know of the regulations applicable to small SI engines and,
without this once in a lifetime exemption, individuals may be stopped at a port of entry with small SI engines and equipment
included with their personal possessions. Additionally, this exemption would relieve a significant burden on EPA
and the U.S. Customs Service. EPA is proposing that, at least for Phase 1 of these regulations, individuals be permitted
to import up to three nonconforming small SI engines and not have these engines brought into compliance with the proposed
standards. This is a one-time exemption (for one importation) in which individuals are permitted to import these
engines for personal use and not for purposes of resale. This exemption would not require prior EPA written approval.
Additional small SI engines, after an individual's limit of three, would not be permitted to be imported under the
proposal unless otherwise provided under another exemption or exclusion. All small SI engines imported for purposes
of resale would be required to be imported and modified by an ICI. If EPA does not finalize an ICI program, such engines
may not be imported for resale. EPA requests comment on this proposed exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposal also provides certain exemptions to the restrictions on importing nonconforming small SI engines.
These include exemptions for repairs and alterations, testing, precertification, display, national security,
hardship, small SI engines greater than 20 original production years old, and certain small SI engines proven to be
identical, in all material respects, to their corresponding United States certified versions. These exemptions
would also include the exclusion of nonconforming engines used solely in competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not proposing to include provisions for a catalyst control program for small SI engines. The catalyst control
program for motor vehicles consists of a special provision for catalyst-equipped vehicles to be operated in countries
where the catalyst may be poisoned by the use of leaded fuel. In the on-highway catalyst control program, owners may
either have the catalyst removed while the vehicle is operated outside of the United States or, if the vehicle is driven
only in countries that have a wide availability of unleaded gasoline, demonstrate by using a plumbtesmo test that
the vehicle was not operated on leaded fuel. EPA is not proposing a catalyst control program for small SI engines because
EPA does not expect that U.S. certified small SI engines equipped with catalysts will be used in countries that do not
have a wide availability of unleaded fuel and then imported into the United States. Additionally, EPA has no knowledge
of the extent to which catalysts will be used on Phase 1 small SI engines. EPA requests comments on the absence of a catalyst
control program and the need for such a program for Phase 1 engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA is not proposing to include a provision for small SI engine Designated Canadian Importer (DCI). EPA's
motor vehicle import program has a special provision in which DCIs may import and sell Canadian vehicles that were
manufactured to be identical in all material respects to U.S. certified counterparts. Because EPA has no indication
that Canada will adopt EPA's Phase 1 small SI engine standards, engines imported from Canada into the United States
will likely be nonconforming engines and thus would not be eligible to be imported by a small SI engine DCI. Consequently,
EPA expects that provisions for small SI engine DCI are unnecessary. EPA requests comment on the absence of a DCI program
and the need for such a program for Phase 1 engines.

Importation regulations are joint regulations between EPA and the United States Department of the Treasury (Customs
Service). The citation for United States Customs Service, Department of Treasury regulations governing import

21. Defect Reporting and Voluntary Recall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that a manufacturer of small SI engines file a defect information report whenever a manufacturer
identifies the existence of a specific emission-related defect in 25 or more engines in a single engine family manufactured
in the same model year. However, no report would need to be filed if the defect was corrected prior to the sale of the affected
engines to the ultimate purchaser. These proposed reporting requirements are similar to the requirements found
in the on-highway program. EPA is currently revising the on-highway reporting program and new regulations will shortly
be proposed. The new regulations may encompass both on-highway and the nonroad sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing that individual manufacturers establish, when appropriate, voluntary recall programs. EPA
is proposing limited guidelines which engine manufacturers would follow when undertaking such a program. EPA invites
comments on how such a voluntary program might be effectively structured.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that engine manufacturers provide an emission warranty for the first two years of engine use. The
two-year warranty period was adopted from California's lawn and garden regulations to reduce the burden on manufacturers
of administering two different warranty programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also considering ``hours of engine use'' as an alternative measure for the warranty period. Under this option,
an engine manufacturer would need to install some form of metering device to track the hours of use for an engine. EPA
solicits comments on this metering option, the feasibility of outfitting small engines with such devices, and the
feasibility of employing the useful life hours generated in the Nonroad Study as a measure for an hours-based warranty
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a warranty program is necessary to ensure the quality of emission control components and systems
that are used on or in nonroad engines and also to protect consumers from costly repairs that result from manufacturing
defects. Furthermore, a warranty program gives the engine owner/operator the incentive to get emission-related
system failures repaired, since failures to the emission control system do not always affect the ability of an engine
to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The warranty requirements proposed today are consistent with emission defect warranty policies developed for on-highway
vehicles, located in section 207(a) of the Act. Manufacturers of new nonroad engines would warrant to the ultimate
purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that such engine was (1) designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at
the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and (2) free from defects in materials and
workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period. The related
parts and components covered by section 207(a) are detailed in an advisory parts list issued by EPA on July 15, 1991,
and encompass parts and systems which are or may be used on small SI engines. A copy of the parts list is in the public docket
for this rulemaking. EPA invites comments on this parts list and its applicability to small SI engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is currently developing more detailed regulations that will further clarify manufacturers' responsibilities
under section 207(a) for both on-highway and nonroad engines. EPA will rely on the existing 207(a) practices until
those regulations are finalized.

23. Tampering Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action would make it illegal for any person to tamper with any emission-related component or system installed
on or in a small SI engine. EPA believes that an engine would more likely continue to meet the applicable emissions standards
in-use if the engine maintained its certified configuration. Therefore, EPA believes it is necessary to impose antitampering
provisions for such engines and is proposing that the existing policies developed for on-highway tampering also
apply to engines included in this rule. See Office of Enforcement and General Counsel; Mobile Source Enforcement
Memorandum No. 1A, June 25, 1974. A copy of this memorandum is in the public docket for this rulemaking.

V. Discussion of Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains further discussion of a number of issues raised during the development of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Use of Metric Units
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Metric units are used throughout the proposed rule without English equivalents. This is done in compliance with the
Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended, and Executive Order 12770, July 25, 1981, which directs all federal agencies
to use metric as the primary unit in regulations by September 30, 1992 and to only provide English equivalents when
the affected party(s) uses English as the primary unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA acknowledges slight differences between the two systems and the use of mixed units by CARB. Comments are solicited
on the impact of using only metric units or the need for including the English equivalent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Use of Power Rating as Cutoff for Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is proposing to limit the applicability of this action to engines at or below 19 kW (25 horsepower) rated power as
compared to CARB's 25 horsepower limit. EPA considered limiting the regulation's applicability based instead on
a total displacement, but has chosen to propose a power-based cutoff for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency with CARB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that the measurement of rated power is subject to engine configuration and test conditions, and that a
cutoff based on power might create an incentive for manufacturers with engines just below the cutoff to change engine
and/or test procedure parameters to result in a higher measured power.

In examining data from Power Systems Research (PSR),
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has identified a relationship between total displacement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rated power which suggests that a one-liter total displacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff would affect nearly an identical group of engines as a 19 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kW cutoff. However, using such a cutoff would cause a limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of engines to be included that would not be included using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 19 kW cutoff (that is, engines above 19 kW but less than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liter displacement). Examples include larger two-stroke engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A limited number of engines would also go unregulated under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario (that is, engines under 19 kW but greater than one

Because of the differences in applicability between a power- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and displacement-based cutoff, EPA has chosen to propose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former despite the potential advantages of the latter. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the appropriateness of instead limiting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation to engines under one-liter total displacement (or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different displacement limit), or limiting the applicability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines that are below displacement or power cutoffs. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

settlement, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will determine by November 1996 whether to undertake a rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which targets emissions from small CI engines. CI engines have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different emission characteristics from the engines addressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal, emitting much lower levels of HC and considerably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher levels of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
than small SI engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the current proposal, which is focused on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving reductions in emissions of HC, a regulation addressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CI engines would likely focus on NOx. EPA lacks sufficient data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding baseline emissions and control technologies for nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CI engines in this power range to determine appropriate standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this time. Therefore EPA has chosen to exclude these engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the current proposal, which is aimed at achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant reductions in small engine HC emissions on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expedited basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is raising this as an issue because of the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that unregulated CI engines could be substituted for post-control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SI engines. In EPA's view, while this may occur in some cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for example, small agricultural tractors), the most price-sensitive products such as string trimmers and lawnmowers
are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlikely to shift significantly toward CI engines due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological limitations, consumer preference, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comment on the exclusion of compression-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignition engines, and on the appropriate test procedure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that should be applied to CI engines if they were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead be covered by this regulation.

D. Exclusion of Recreational Propulsion Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to exclude engines used in recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles, examples of which include snowmobiles, off-road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motorcycles, and all-terrain vehicles. Golf carts do not qualify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as recreational vehicles under this proposal, and they would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the emission standards of this rule. Engines used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such recreational vehicles are defined by the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics: Use of a continuously variable throttle (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to a governor), rated engine speeds in excess of 5,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RPM, and wide variations in both engine load and speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's primary reason for this exclusion is the extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient operation of the products in which these engines are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, which limits the ability of the proposed steady state test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure to adequately represent exhaust emissions. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion is not based on a determination that these engines do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contribute to air pollution and therefore need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled. EPA has chosen to exclude engines used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational vehicles in order that it may proceed quickly with a

EPA proposes to exclude marine propulsion engines, examples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which, in this power range, include outboard marine engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is developing emission standards for marine propulsion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines in a separate action. However, small SI engines used on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine vessels for purposes other than propulsion, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generators and pumps, are not excluded in this proposal.

F. Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to incorporate in this rule the nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine definition proposed in the large CI rule. EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in this rule any changes to that definition included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final large CI rule. EPA is also proposing to amend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of nonroad vehicle proposed there by adding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following sentence: ``Nonroad vehicle also includes equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is powered by nonroad engines.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory definition of nonroad vehicle adopted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress in the 1990 CAA Amendments provides little guidance as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to what is a nonroad vehicle. Rather, statutory language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes only what is not a nonroad vehicle, namely, motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles and vehicles used solely for competition. A review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Conference Report, the Statement of Senate Managers, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement of House Managers does not provide any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance. It is necessary to examine both the House and Senate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee Reports of the original legislation before this issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States House of Representatives, Committee on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy and Commerce, Report on H.R. 3030, offers some insight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the meaning of both nonroad engine and vehicle. In part the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report states, ``(T)he term `nonroad engine' is defined for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this section to include certain internal combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines not used in a motor vehicle or a competition vehicle, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while a nonroad vehicle is a vehicle powered by (a) nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine that is not a motor vehicle and not used solely for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition. Stationary internal combustion engines are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated under Title I of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are not subject to the requirements of this section.''

EPA believes that Congress used the terms ``non-road engine,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``equipment,'' and ``vehicle'' interchangeably. It is EPA's belief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Congress intended nonroad vehicles and nonroad engines to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be inclusive terms covering all manner of equipment not defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as motor vehicles, vehicles for competition, and stationary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. Furthermore, there is a practical interrelationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between an engine and the equipment that houses it or is powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by it. Equipment or vehicle characteristics may have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact on the emissions associated with the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the engine. The nonroad engine definition proposed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large CI rule and incorporated in this rulemaking relies to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
great extent on this interrelationship between an engine and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piece of equipment to determine whether an engine is a nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. In future development of a small SI engine program, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may become necessary and appropriate to regulate aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment to control fuel spillage, evaporative emissions, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling emissions. EPA believes that CAA section 213 provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for such regulation.

G. Definition of Handheld Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that engines intended for use in equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as handheld be certified to standards much less stringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those applicable to engines used in nonhandheld equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, on a percentage basis, the reductions obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld and nonhandheld engines will be of similar magnitude. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the unique characteristics of handheld 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, it is not feasible, given the timing of this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the unique performance requirements of handheld equipment, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that all engines covered in this proposal meet emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels that can be achieved by 4-stroke engines used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This distinction is based, in part, on the substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between emissions from current 4-stroke and 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines, which is an inherent result of the design differences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these engines. Because of scavenging losses, current 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines generally emit approximately ten times more unburned HC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(on an energy-specific basis) than their 4-stroke counterparts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, current 2-stroke engines are generally lighter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than current 4-stroke engines of the same rated power and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in any orientation. As a result, applications requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the operator pick up and/or carry the device while using it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for example, chain saws), are nearly exclusively powered by 2- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stroke engines. On the other hand, nonhandheld applications such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as lawnmowers, which are currently sold in both 2-stroke and 4-stroke versions, can clearly be powered by 4-stroke
engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 90 percent of the lawnmowers sold in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are powered by 4-stroke engines. Section VII discusses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present market mix of small engines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to distinguish between ``handheld'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``nonhandheld'' equipment in a manner that is similar to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by CARB. However, EPA proposes to clarify and expand on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California's handheld definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in cases where the operator carries all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment's weight during engine operation, the equipment would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be classified as handheld. Second, where the equipment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly required to operate in any position the equipment would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be classified as handheld. California's handheld definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that the equipment must both be carried and used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multipositionally in order to qualify for handheld status. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on whether this approach may preclude equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is in practice ``handheld'' from qualifying for handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status. The proposed federal definition does not require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both stated criteria be present for a given piece of equipment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify as handheld. One criterion is sufficient. It is EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent that the preceding two criteria allow leafblowers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimmers (both string and hedge), cutters, or chain saws to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for handheld status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA is proposing that engines be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet Class III, IV, or V standards if the dry weight of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment they are used in, including engine weight, is under 14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kg, there are no more than two wheels present on the equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least one of the following three attributes is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present: (1) The operator alternately provides support or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carries the equipment throughout its performance; (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator provides support and attitudinal control for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment throughout its performance; (3) the engine is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusively in a generator or pump. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a weight-based criterion is an appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial determinant of whether a 2-stroke engine can be handheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry data show clear weight distinctions between those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines which are ``lightweight'' and made for handheld operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and those which are not. For example, review of industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brochures revealed that 2-stroke engines were almost always found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in equipment under 14 kg. In addition, the presence of not more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than two wheels in a given piece of equipment is another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important indicator of the need for an operator to either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support, carry, or provide attitudinal control for the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first attribute seeks to classify as ``handheld'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment which is either carried or supported by the operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the entire engine operation. An operator carries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment when the full weight of the equipment is borne by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator. Support means that the operator holds the equipment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position so as to prevent it from falling, slipping, or sinking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The entire weight of the equipment is not necessarily borne by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operator. Legitimate sources of support might include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground, ice, wood, or concrete. EPA intends that lightweight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snowblowers, edgers, and augers qualify for handheld status under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this first attribute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second attribute classifies as ``handheld'' equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which requires either operator support or attitudinal control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the entire operation. Attitudinal control means the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator regulates either the horizontal or vertical position of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment. This definition is meant to allow certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lightweight tillers, augers, or edgers to qualify for handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status. Both ice and earth augers must be carried to each drill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site by the operator, and must be supported by the operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during operation. In addition, the operator must control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vertical attitude of the equipment during operation including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulling upward after each hole is drilled. Tillers without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wheels or with no more than two wheels are designed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported or picked up frequently during operation while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maneuvering between rows in a garden. Likewise, the vertical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal position of the tiller is controlled by the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the third attribute acknowledges that engines used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lightweight pumps and generators should be allowed to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld emission standards. Like augers, lightweight generators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pumps are carried to the work site by the operator and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate at significant distances from electrical-power outlets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other equipment would be classified as nonhandheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Examples of nonhandheld equipment include lawnmowers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compressors, lawn tractors, garden tractors, tillers with wheels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chippers/grinders, and log splitters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the proposed handheld definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies sufficient criteria by which all handheld equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types may be classified. However, it may still be possible that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain equipment types which are in practice handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications would not meet this definition. EPA is considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to institute a ``case-by-case review process'' so that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where appropriate in the Administrator's judgment, engines used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in specific types of nonhandheld equipment would either be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reclassified as handheld or would be allowed to meet the handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards as if that type of equipment was classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld. In such cases, the Administrator might consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors including, but not necessarily limited to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equipment function and design (for example, handle placement); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment capability; equipment weight; engine weight; rated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power; multipositional operating requirements; presence and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of wheels; presence of other weight supports; availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of similar 4-stroke, electric, and/or nonpowered models by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same manufacturer or competitors; typical operating profiles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including season of use), and nationwide annual industry-wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales. The manufacturer requesting such a review might be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to demonstrate, based on these and any other pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, that a 2-stroke engine clearly was a necessary design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feature of the equipment concerned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is currently aware of at least one type of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in EPA's view, might need to be evaluated through such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Unlike CARB, EPA is not allowing all currently produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-stroke snowthrowers to meet standards applicable to engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in handheld equipment. In approving its regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California accepted arguments that nonhandheld 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snowthrowers should be allowed an exemption from the nonhandheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to meet emission standards for handheld engines. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's view, at least two factors could have formed a basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this decision: First, snowthrowers are operated in the winter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which means that they do not significantly impact ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment and thus need not be subject to stringent control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aimed at improving ambient air quality; and second, at least some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the lightweight 2-stroke snowthrowers that were exempted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld standards appear to be designed to be picked up while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in operation (for example, to clear porch steps), implying that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of a 4-stroke engine would significantly limit critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the first of these factors raises questions regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need to control emissions at all from products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly only used in the winter, regardless of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification as handheld or nonhandheld, those questions must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be weighed against the need to address CO emissions, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to protect the health of equipment operators. The second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor reveals potential problems with CARB's definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``handheld.'' Specifically, CARB's action with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snowthrowers raises questions regarding other ``fringe'' products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it would be appropriate to classify as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handheld equipment lightweight snowthrowers under 14 kg which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have no more than two wheels and which would either be carried or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported during operation. All other snowthrowers would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as nonhandheld and required to meet the standards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were generally applicable to engines used in nonhandheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. EPA solicits comment on this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under EPA's proposed definitions, lawnmowers will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as nonhandheld equipment and thus engines used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lawnmowers must meet the more stringent nonhandheld emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Manufacturers of 2-stroke lawnmower engines have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised concerns over their economic survival if required to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld standards, based on their doubt that cost-effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology now exists to bring their 2-stroke engines into timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. EPA requests comment on the ability of 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lawnmower engine manufacturers to meet the nonhandheld standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact such a requirement would have on such manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for relief for such manufacturers, and the impact such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief might have on the environmental benefits of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA further requests comment on the following options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing relief to 2-stroke lawnmower engine manufacturers: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide an extended effective date, such as 1998, for 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lawnmower engines to meet the nonhandheld standards; (2) allow 2- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stroke lawnmower engines to meet the handheld engine standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the effective date of the second phase of small SI engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations; (3) cap the number of 2-stroke lawnmowers allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify to the handheld standards to the number sold in the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal is published or promulgated until the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the second phase of small SI engine regulations; or (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow a declining percentage of 2-stroke lawnmower engines to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

percent in 1997, 50 percent in 1998, and 25 percent in 1999, so

EPA solicits comment on the proposed definition of handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and on the potential process for handling those types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of equipment that may pose difficulties to classification. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also requests comment on the specific cases discussed. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comment on alternative definitions that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Alternative definitions of ``handheld equipment'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might include, but need not be limited to, the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lack of wheels or other means of support (other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I11&bull;Overall weight below some limit such as 10 kg or 20 kg, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Portion of overall weight attributable to current engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above some minimum, such as 75 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Conversely, alternative definitions of ``nonhandheld equipment'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could include elements such as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Presence of wheels or other means of support other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Overall weight above some minimum such as 10 kg or 20 kg, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Portion of overall weight attributable to current engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below some limit such as 75 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be recognized that recent engineering developments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may eventually obviate the need to provide different standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for handheld and nonhandheld equipment engines. Future technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solutions may provide engines used in all applications with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable emission performance capability. For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firm has recently announced plans to begin marketing portable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
string trimmers, traditionally powered by either electricity or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-stroke gasoline engines, that are instead powered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lightweight, high-speed 4-stroke engines. This company claims to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve emission rates much lower than either current 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines or engines that would meet the handheld standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in this rulemaking. Numerous efforts are also under way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop direct injection systems applicable to larger 2-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine-systems that may be able to bring emissions from engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as those used for outboard marine engines down to levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to a well-calibrated 4-stroke engine in the same power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range. However, the applicability of direct injection systems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small engines used in handheld applications has not yet been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigated. In developing Phase 2 standards, EPA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisit this issue in its entirety and may combine all engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under one set of standards, modify the definitions of nonhandheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and handheld equipment, as well as the applicable standards, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may promulgate an entirely different regulatory structure.

H. Requirements Applicable to Vehicle and Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to require that vehicle and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers and importers use the appropriate handheld or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhandheld certified engine in their vehicles and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213 gives EPA the authority to require nonroad vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and equipment manufacturers and importers to use certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engines. EPA has determined that the most effective way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that certified engines are used in nonroad vehicles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment is to require that manufacturers and importers use such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. Without such a requirement, there would be no penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for vehicle and equipment manufacturers that knowingly purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncomplying engines, thus undercutting the entire program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that vehicle and equipment manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers be subject to the prohibition, injunction, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty provisions of CAA sections 203, 204, and 205, except that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only the nonroad engine in the vehicle or equipment, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle or equipment itself, would need to be certified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. Although engine manufacturers will bear the burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of certification under this proposal, the focus of enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will fall to some extent on vehicle and equipment manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they determine whether a handheld or nonhandheld engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is appropriate for use in their vehicle or equipment and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that those engines are certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No federal paperwork or reporting burden would be imposed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle and equipment manufacturers by the requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified nonroad engines be used. This is consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad large CI engine proposal (58 FR 28809 at 28815 (May 17, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993) and 58 FR 51595 at 51597 (October 4, 1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only new engines manufactured on or after the effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this rule would be subject to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, rebuilt engines originally manufactured prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this rule would not be subject to this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rebuilt engines originally manufactured after the effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this rule would be subject only to the tampering provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New replacement engines manufactured after the effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be subject to this rule. EPA requests comment on whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is any need for manufacturers to produce replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines for use in pre-1996 equipment, and the extent of such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need, if any. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labeling requirements proposed in this notice may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers.

I. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing an effective date of August 1, 1996 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking. This midyear effective date coincides with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model changeover in the small SI engine industry. Engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured on or after August 1, 1996 for use within the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States would have to meet the standards and requirements included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vehicle and equipment manufacturers that use regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines would be required to use appropriate certified nonroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines in their vehicles and equipment after August 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether a separate effective date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers should be established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, if so, whether that date should be three months after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 1, 1996 effective date for nonroad engine manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(that is, November 1, 1996). It appears, based on best available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, that the start of large volume equipment production is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately November 1 of every year. EPA is considering this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate effective date because it is concerned that equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers have small inventories of noncertified engines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could not be incorporated into equipment by the August 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date. EPA would consider extending this flexibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months, that is, February 1, 1997, if manufacturers could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitatively demonstrate that the increased risk of stockpiling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncertified engines by the equipment manufacturers would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal and the inventory buildup would be normal. EPA also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on whether a separate effective date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment manufacturers should be based on introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment into commerce, rather than the date of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 1996 effective date allows engine manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over two years of lead time from the date of this proposal, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than one year beyond the 1995 implementation date imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB. EPA is not proposing the same effective date as CARB in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to allow manufacturers some lead time between the CARB and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal effective dates to bring preempted engines into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance; however, EPA requests comment on the feasibility of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995 effective date for federal standards, particularly for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines that are not preempted from state regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA acknowledges the need for sufficient lead time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform research, develop testing capacity, apply emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control technology, and manufacture clean engines, EPA's view is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that engine manufacturers have been aware for a considerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time that emission regulations were likely to impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their products in the near future. In 1990, CARB was required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) to develop emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for lawn and garden and utility equipment engines by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December of 1990. In November of 1990, Congress amended the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal Clean Air Act, requiring that EPA study emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonroad engines and vehicles by November of 1991 and promulgate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable regulations by November of 1992 if these sources were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to contribute significantly to air pollution. At a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workshop held in March of 1992, EPA discussed the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from small SI engines, announcing its intent to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable regulations. Consequently, manufacturers have known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since March 1992, at the latest, that EPA was planning to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards applicable to their products, and have already had more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than two years to assess emission control technologies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop testing capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several state and environmental interest groups have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concerns that a 1996 effective date delays the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realization of reductions of in-use air pollutant emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily and limits the ability of many states to adhere to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the schedules mandated in the CAA for reasonable further progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward volatile organic compound reductions from 1990 levels and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard. Manufacturers have argued that a 1996 effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers too little lead time given that this proposed rule covers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various categories of equipment that California is preempted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulating.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and the Engine Manufacturers Association have requested that EPA extend
the effective date to 1997 for all engines. The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association has requested
that EPA extend it to 1997 for engines regulated and sold in California and to 1999 for preempted engines and engines
discontinued in California. These industry association requests are available in the docket for this rulemaking.
In all cases, these associations have argued that more lead time is needed to apply these standards to nationwide sales.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the impact of its proposed effective date on both engine and equipment manufacturers. EPA
also requests comment on alternative effective dates, including phased effective dates, such as 1996 for nonpreempted
engines and 1997 for preempted engines, or a phase-in by engine size where Class I, II, III, IV, and V engines would meet
the applicable standards at different times based on environmental impact and lead time

constraints.

J. Selection of Worst Case Emitter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA is proposing to use the criteria of highest weighted brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) over the appropriate
engine test cycle to determine that engine configuration within an engine family which will be selected as the certification
test engine. EPA believes that BSFC is an appropriate criterion for selecting a worst case emitter. In particular,
EPA believes that an engine configuration with high BSFC will generally emit higher levels of hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide than a second configuration in the same engine family which has a lower BSFC. EPA solicits comments on the
appropriateness of weighted BSFC as the criterion to be used for selecting the worst case emitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered one alternative method of selecting the worst case emitter. EPA considered leaving the selection
of the worst case emitter up to the engine manufacturer with the guideline that the engine manufacturer must test that
engine configuration within an engine family which is most likely to exceed any emission standard. EPA solicits comment
on the appropriateness of this approach for selecting the worst case emitter.

K. Adequacy of Test Cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The test procedure proposed in this notice is capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicting emission reductions at the level of proposed emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. The proposed test cycles are based on the Society of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
J1088. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a procedure that measures emissions over a number of steady state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating modes or conditions (speed/load points) and determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average emissions over the entire test cycle by weighting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modes relative to their likely occurrence in actual use. Much of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emission assessment work to date has occurred using the J1088 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the types of technology that will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forced by setting standards using the proposed test cycle will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in real emission reductions in actual use. The current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible technologies are analogue in nature. Thus, when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology is demonstrated to reduce emissions on six discrete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points on the engine speed/load performance curve, EPA expects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these technologies will perform in a continuum between those test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points. No large emission spikes will occur under operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that were not specifically tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No time is available to develop a more accurate test cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While improvements can be made and must be studied before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing more stringent emission standards that require more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sophisticated technologies, EPA has determined this test cycle is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to produce the desired emission reductions expected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Phase 2 emission regulation process, EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified three test modes of the test cycle that it intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study. First, EPA wants to evaluate whether the test procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be run using the engine's governor to control throttle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA wants to evaluate the method by which the load points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the test cycle are determined. Third, EPA wants to study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sensitivity of emissions to the operating conditions not used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the test cycle to ensure emission benefits are not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlooked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating the engine directly on the governor as opposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the throttle is allowed in the current test procedure as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed. However, it is optional and most manufacturers choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to run the test by directly controlling the throttle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers do this to reduce the factors that can add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability to the test. EPA believes that, since engines in use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are controlled by the governor, a test cycle that simulates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual operation as closely as possible has the potential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predict real in-use emissions more accurately. Before such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change is adopted, EPA intends to analyze the validity of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hypothesis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average power generated during the test cycle has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large impact on the emission result. The emission standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the mass emission generated for the amount of work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished (g/kWh). Since power is a factor in how much work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be accomplished, it weighs heavily in the final mass emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result. EPA wants to ensure that the test cycle does not reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how much power (and thus work) the engine is capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving, but is reflective of how much power the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually commands from the engine as it does its work. EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that the actual power drawn by equipment in actual use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is lower than the average power drawn from the engine during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed test procedures. EPA does not have time to adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify this hypothesis within the timeline of this rule, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to do this during the Phase 2 rulemaking process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, EPA has not verified that the operating modes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed test procedures are the optimal representation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what happens in actual use. Any test cycle is at best an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximation of the operating conditions experienced by engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in actual use. Indeed, any one engine will be installed in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of equipment types and will experience a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating environment in each application. To determine if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedures are doing the best possible job at estimating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real world operation, EPA intends to collect data on a full range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of operating conditions that are not represented in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test cycle. Manufacturers have presented histograms of a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of equipment operations such that, for purposes of this notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test cycle is directionally acceptable. Further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation may result in a determination that the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle adequately covers the range of operation. However, time is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not available to make that determination in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any of the above mentioned changes to the current proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test cycle or procedures would require extensive testing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development. All emission data to date is based on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedures. Before introducing any change in the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures EPA would have to develop emission standards based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised procedures and would have to assess emission impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the procedures. The current timeline constraints provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither adequate time to properly assess whether any of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes would benefit the program, nor adequate time to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate emission standards using the revised procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Faced with these constraints, EPA believes that the proposed test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are the best available to ensure early emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction from the engines covered in this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is not proposing the requirement of any specific type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel to be used in engines produced to meet the proposed emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. EPA's proposal would require that all SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 19 kW meet the proposed standards. This includes SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines which run on ``alternative'' fuels, such as liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas. A few research papers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been published which indicate well calibrated spark-ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines running on LPG fuel may be able to meet the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards with less difficulty than an equivalent engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
running on gasoline. EPA proposes to let the engine manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide what type of fuel a given engine application will use and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not require any specific engine to use a ``cleaner'' fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposal would not allow engines which are designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run on gasoline to perform certification emission testing using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an alternative fuel. EPA understands that oxygenated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulated gasoline fuel is currently available in different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas around the United States. However, availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygenated and reformulated fuels varies widely across the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. EPA does not have information that would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate assurance that the alternative fuel, and not gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be used in these engines in actual use. Faced with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulty of tracking small SI engine owners, EPA does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate resources, nor an adequate tracking mechanism to enforce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a requirement that small SI engine owners use only the specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative fuel. At the same time, preliminary tests performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on small engines using reformulated and oxygenated fuels show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately a three to five percent improvement in exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission levels of CO and total HC. See the draft RSD in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
docket for further discussion of this issue. Reformulated fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was designed to lower HC levels from on-highway vehicles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily engines with fuel injection and catalytic convertors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not convinced it can reasonably expect the same type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit from carbureted single and two-cylinder engines. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comment on the feasibility of requiring small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to run only on oxygenated or reformulated fuels.

EPA is considering two options for setting Class I and II

HC and NOx standards. Option 1 would consist of setting a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

inevitable consequence of the level of HC reduction being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved in this rule. Furthermore, EPA estimates that the

 emission inventories would be slight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough in this particular case to be warranted given the much

greater decrease in HC emission inventories. See ``VI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Benefit Assessment'' in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonroad small SI engines currently operate on an extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rich fuel and air mixture_in other words, one that contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very high proportion of fuel relative to that used by, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, automotive engines. Because this results both in less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete combustion and much lower peak combustion temperatures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust concentrations of unburned HC are extremely high, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are extremely low. As a result, small SI

very little to NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 19 ozone nonattainment areas studied by EPA in the 1991 Nonroad Study, emissions from all nonroad sources, on
average, represented ten percent of total HC emissions and 17 percent of total NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

sources, but only one percent of total NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In contrast, nonroad large CI engines, for which EPA has proposed NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards, contributed an average of ten percent of total HC from nonroad sources and 75 percent of total NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Consequently, EPA's primary focus in developing emission standards for small SI engines is achieving sizeable
reductions in HC emission rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the extremely rich operation of small SI engines, EPA does not believe that small engine technology is available
to prevent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels from increasing while HC levels decrease substantially within the short lead time period set forth in this
proposal. While it may be possible in some isolated cases to employ automotive-type emission control systems relying
on closed-loop operation and three-way catalytic converters, the state of development of such technology is not
ready for small engine application in the short lead time proposed. Furthermore, the sensitivity of such systems
to in-use deterioration and malmaintenance would greatly lessen their in-use effectiveness given the state of the
service industry available to these engines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has estimated that by the year 2020, when current equipment turnover is projected, the proposed emission standards
would result in approximately a 32 percent reduction in HC emission from current levels, or 356,710 tons per year.
Under the same timeframe, in-use NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission rates would be expected to increase 1.36-fold, or 34,000 tons per year. Given the magnitude of the relative
contribution of these small SI engines to HC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission inventories in ozone nonattainment areas, EPA believes this projected decrease in HC and increase in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels would be consistent with EPA's statutory mandate that emissions standards reflect the greatest emission
reductions achievable. This is especially the case in light of the fact that this rule would increase the national
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inventory by about one quarter of one percent, while EPA's nonroad large CI engine regulations would reduce the national
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inventory by about four percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that, given the magnitude of the HC reduction proposed, emission rates would be marginally sensitive
enough that near-term compliance with separate emission standards at the proposed level of stringency could be difficult
in some cases, whereas compliance with a combined standard is expected to be achievable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA is concerned that establishing a combined standard might be viewed as setting a precedent for future
rulemakings. EPA does not intend to establish any such precedent, and is considering a combined standard for Phase
1 only due to the present lack of available data for setting a separate NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard, the current lack of technology for achieving NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions simultaneously with HC reductions for the subject engines and vehicles, the need to achieve HC reductions
as soon as possible under the Phase 1 rule, and the desire to harmonize with California's standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on a combined standard (option 1). EPA also requests comments and data supporting separate numerical
standards for HC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (option 2). Based on information currently available to EPA, if it were necessary to develop separate standards,
the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard would be approximately 136 percent higher than current new engine levels, while the HC standards would be
approximately equal to the difference between those levels and the proposed HC+NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is concerned that the CO levels for handheld engines be kept as low as possible. The operators of equipment using
these engines are in close proximity to the exhaust pipe. The Class V engines are a large concern. The majority of these
engines are used on large commercial chain saws used in logging operations. The high power and high load factors associated
with this equipment mean the operator is potentially exposed to a high CO rate from the engine and could experience
high CO intake during operation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to limit CO emissions from large (Class V) handheld engines to 402 g/kWh. In comparison, smaller (Class
III, IV) handheld engines would be required to meet the higher standard of 804 g/kWh. The larger Class V engines have
technical advantages over smaller engines, with respect to fuel metering and combustion chamber boundary layer
conditions, that would allow them to achieve these lower levels of CO emission. This technical rationale is discussed
at length in the draft RSD in the docket. In addition to the technical rationale that the Class V engines are capable
of lower CO emission levels, a number of engines were tested by the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association
(PPEMA) and an individual manufacturer, modified for a six percent enleanment over current production calibration.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of these engines met the 402 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
g/kWh CO standard, achieving average CO levels of eight percent below the standard. The remaining engines tested
did not meet either the HC or the CO emission standards. (See data in the draft RSD.) EPA observed that, in general, port
design may affect the ease with which engines can meet emission standards. EPA requests comment and data on whether
there is a supportable technical rationale why it would not be feasible to further optimize these engines to bring
both the HC and CO emissions into line with the engines capable of achieving the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PPEMA has argued that the 402 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
g/kWh level is too stringent, but did not focus on Class V engines at the time California rules were being considered
since its members anticipated limited regulation of the Class V engines in California due to preemption of many of
the products in which these engines are used. In a letter to EPA, a copy of which is included in the docket for this rulemaking,
PPEMA suggests that a standard of 603 g/kWh would be more appropriate. EPA would need further data and information
that establishes 603 g/kWh as the appropriate technical limit and addresses the need for this higher CO standard as
noted above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the data currently available, EPA does not see the need for the higher standard and believes that the proposed
standard is achievable. However, EPA is requesting additional information and data that would verify the need for
the higher standard and justify why all engines cannot be designed to meet the CO levels achieved by the 20 to 30 percent
of engines tested by PPEMA that met all proposed standards.

O. Cap on Noise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to require that engine noise levels not increase as a result of this rulemaking. The type of engine
changes which EPA believes will be used to meet the proposed exhaust gaseous emission standards should not increase
engine noise above current levels. EPA is aware that several European nations currently have sound level standards
for different classes of nonroad equipment, some of which are powered by SI engines less than 19 kW. EPA lacks the necessary
information to determine if regulating engine noise without regard to the type of equipment in which the engine will
eventually be used is a sensible technical approach. EPA requests data and comments on this issue.

P. Applicability of In-Use Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule does not require that small engines meet in-use standards over a useful life period for several reasons.
First, limited emission testing of in-use engines has been performed. Additional data will be provided by the in-use
testing program described in ``IV.C. Program Description and Rationale.'' Second, EPA does not believe that emission
controls proposed for Phase 1 will experience significant deterioration beyond normal engine deterioration, although
this area needs more research. EPA does acknowledge its responsibility to achieve enforceable reductions of in-use
emissions and plans to develop such measures in its long-term Phase 2 program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until such measures are developed, EPA proposes to maintain regulatory language in the Phase 1 rule that commits EPA
to setting in-use standards and useful life periods by April 1997. In developing Phase 2 regulations, EPA intends
to amend this language, replacing it with regulatory language specifying programs that are developed to meet this
commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits comment on the lack of in-use standards and on the appropriate level of in-use standards, useful life
period, and enforcement measures if EPA were to make these a requirement of Phase 1. EPA also invites comment on the
regulatory language in the Phase 1 rule that commits EPA to developing these requirements by April 1997. This language
states, ``A useful life period for engines subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part will be set by the Agency
and will be promulgated no later than the year 1997.''

Q. In-Use Testing Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal requires that manufacturers procure and test a sample of in-use engines and report the results to EPA.
In developing this program, EPA considered manufacturer suggestions that any in-use testing program be conducted
jointly between EPA, manufacturers, and manufacturers' organizations. EPA is concerned that a joint program would
not as efficiently address the goals of the proposed in-use testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing the in-use testing requirement with two main goals in mind. Primarily, EPA believes that a critical
element in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines that continue to meet emission
standards beyond the certification and production stages. By requiring manufacturers to test and report results,
EPA expects that manufacturers would act responsibly to avoid or correct in-use emission problems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's authority to recall engines which do not comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards in use provides an important incentive to on-highway manufacturers to design and build durable
engines and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. However, at this time, EPA has limited data by which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to propose in-use standards for small SI engines under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
213(d) of the CAA, subjecting nonroad engine manufacturers to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of section 207(c) of the CAA. Because EPA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to establish in-use emission standards in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, it is necessary to require that manufacturers test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-use engines to gain important knowledge about the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterioration of their engines and report the results to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that this knowledge will be critical to developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more durable emission control systems and achieving better in-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with Phase 2 engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An auxiliary outcome of this Phase 1 testing program would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be that manufacturers, by working closely with EPA to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-use emissions and identify solutions to problems, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparing for the Phase 2 in-use compliance program. This Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 testing program would permit issues associated with a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of maintenance and use conditions to be identified and resolved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to Phase 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, EPA is concerned that these goals may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be as fully achieved with joint testing programs involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several manufacturers and their respective organizations. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring direct communication with EPA, manufacturers would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to individually provide test data showing in-use performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's experience has been that aggregate data (sorted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations and stripped of engine identification) is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective in identifying specific in-use problems. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated Phase 1 in-use data would improve estimates of in-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, thereby enhancing the basis for emission inventories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to support the State Implementation Plan (SIP) development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the critical feedback the in-use testing program would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide, EPA believes it is compelled to ensure the fulfillment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the obligation to perform in-use testing. For engine families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where in-use testing would be required, certification is proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be conditioned upon the completion of a number of in-use tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as agreed upon by EPA and the manufacturer at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. Completion of the number of valid in-use tests as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreed, regardless of the test results, would satisfy this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, a manufacturer's failure to fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
execute the in-use tests would be considered a failure to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions under which the certificate was issued. An engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be considered to be covered by the certificate only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer fulfilled the conditions upon which the certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was issued. Thus, failure to satisfy the conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate could subject a manufacturer to the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil penalties. However, EPA recognizes that a manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding its best efforts, might fail to perform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required testing due to circumstances beyond its control. Thus EPA would consider all relevant factors when determining
whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to view an engine as not being covered by a certificate based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of a manufacturer to fully execute the test program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the proposed in-use testing program.

R. Absence of Averaging, Banking, and Trading Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is not proposing an averaging, banking, and trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (ABT) for small SI engines at this time. ABT programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which EPA uses in its on-highway heavy-duty engine program and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for the nonroad large CI engine program, provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers flexibility in meeting the emission standards. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is increasingly using market-based incentive programs such as ABT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because such programs can reduce the cost of controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. An ABT trading program can also reduce the burden of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation on small manufacturers by providing them flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in meeting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, EPA has not been able to construct an ABT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, given the uncertainties surrounding projected in-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission levels. These uncertainties will be resolved as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Phase 2 regulatory negotiations. However, as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of approving an ABT program, EPA must know the in- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use emission characteristics of engine families in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement an ABT standard, unless all engine families deteriorate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the same rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lifetime emissions of engine families must be averaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together in order to compute the average emission level of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's product line. Use of lifetime emissions is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary because it may be the case that the emissions of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of engine deteriorate at a higher rate than another type, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a smaller engine may deteriorate at a higher rate than a larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine of the same type. EPA is not in a position to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what the in-use emission level is presently or would be under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Phase 1 regulation. EPA's initial assessment is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of these engines deteriorate somewhat over time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely deteriorate at different rates between engine families, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but more research is necessary. However, even if engine families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deteriorate at different rates, if such deterioration is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systematically biased, it may not undermine the validity of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABT program. EPA requests comment on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 2 will directly assess in-use emission characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engine families and incorporate enforcement of in-use emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. Once in-use emission levels are known with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence, EPA expects that market-based programs such as ABT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be viewed favorably by the regulatory negotiation committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during policy development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the absence of an ABT program.

S. Engine Manufacturer Requirement_Disclosure of Maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhaust Pressure and Minimum Inlet Pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design of the exhaust system can influence emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most small engines are supplied with both an air inlet system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exhaust system which are tested as part of the engine package, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the entire package is used by the equipment manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some engines are designed to be installed in a chassis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with more complex packaging requirements where the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer may supply and/or install the exhaust system, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of it, and even the air inlet system. In these latter cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering a requirement that the engine manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would need to specify to the equipment manufacturer the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust pressure and the minimum inlet pressure, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment manufacturer would be required to adhere to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications. EPA requests both engine and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer comments regarding this issue.

T. Direct Health Effects of Air Toxics and CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the concern of the role of HC and CO in ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and CO nonattainment, EPA is concerned about direct health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of air toxics and CO exposure. The concentrations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct health effects of toxic pollutants in exhaust are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially important because the operator of a small SI engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application is typically near the equipment as it functions. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some applications, the operator must be adjacent to the exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlet and is in the direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. See ``VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment'' for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of this issue. The Agency requests additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the effects of air toxics and CO exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the use of small SI engines.

U. Catalyst Durability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Relative to all other types of emission-related engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, catalysts are unique in that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Relatively small changes in chemical and/or physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of a catalyst can result in very large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleterious changes in operational characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The engine manufacturer is not likely to be involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the design or fabrication of the catalysts nor be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify the acceptability of vendor-supplied catalysts by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of the simple checks and tests that are adequate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other engine components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The satisfactory operational durability of catalysts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much more dependent on the catalyst manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietary techniques and processes than is the case with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other emission control system components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Since it is the last component in the emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, a catalyst can compensate for sub-standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performances by other emission control components, but it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not itself supported by any other back-up component that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to compensate for a reduction in catalyst performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Substantial reductions in performance can result from:

between the catalyst and its protective outer metal

_Poisoning as a result of fuel contaminants (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Glazing as a result of excessive quantities of

lubricating oil in the exhaust, and

_Thermal degradation as a result of exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessively high temperatures for prolonged periods.

Catalytic converters designed for small SI engines in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short term will be low efficiency catalysts to address safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns. The catalysts designed for potential Phase 1 use would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have conversion efficiencies on the order of approximately 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for HC and CO emission. The design constraint that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dictates these low efficiencies is the need to limit the increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in exhaust temperatures, since the exhaust is in close proximity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the operator in handheld equipment. Efficiencies much higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 30 percent begin to generate exotherms that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially increase exhaust temperatures. Since the industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not yet developed the necessary solutions, such as creative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small-scale insulation approaches, to control the added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, only low efficiency catalysts would be available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 1 use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While adequate durability of catalysts is a concern relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to catalytic converters used in on-highway engine applications, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is less concerned with the emission impact of failures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalytic converters expected to be used for engines regulated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule. This is because the conversion efficiency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalysts used in small SI engines would not exceed approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 percent for reasons discussed in the previous paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Faced with this constraint, an engine manufacturer would need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify its base engine to realize substantial emission reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engine-out emissions even before the exhaust was converted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further by the catalytic converter. Should such a low efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst fail in use, the increase in emissions would not be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large as occurs when a high efficiency on-highway vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preceding discussion underscores the need for some means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to validate the adequacy of catalysts that would be added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines to provide compliance with the emission standards during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-use operation. Various approaches could be used for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the ``long term'' conversion capabilities of catalysts would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be adequate. For example, certification engines could be tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with catalysts which had been subjected to some type of ``aging'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process to substantiate that the catalysts were adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and fabricated. Alternatively, certification engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be tested with new catalysts that had been proven to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory by meeting the requirements of a catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification procedure that would be separate from the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission certification test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main advantage of a validation approach involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of ``aged'' catalysts on certification engines would be its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simplicity. The aging process would be carried out by either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine manufacturers or the catalyst vendors. In either case, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there would be no requirements for special catalyst performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and, hence, no need for the establishment of performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that would be needed for evaluating the test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main disadvantage of this approach is the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative impact on catalyst usage that might result from a Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 certification process which imposed durability testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on catalysts but not on certification engines or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other engine components involved in their construction. On one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand, the dependence of successful certification of engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families on the performance capabilities of aged catalysts might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in engine manufacturers being reluctant to use catalysts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the applicable emission standards. Also, given that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is limited field data on small engine catalysts, it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be extremely difficult to design a fair aging procedure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be evaluated by the certification engine test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanying emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such possibly adverse results would be avoided by the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's use of a new catalyst that was ``certified'' by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplier or the engine manufacturer as having design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication details that resulted in specific long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion performance capabilities. This approach would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disadvantage of being more complicated in that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additionally involves the establishment of limits on the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of efficiency loss that would be acceptable and would require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure for determining compliance with such limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a consequence of concerns regarding possible negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts on catalyst development for small engines that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from a provision requiring the certification of engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with aged catalysts, EPA is not proposing such a requirement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this notice. Instead, EPA is proposing that for systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing catalysts, the certification engine configuration to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested must be equipped with a new catalyst of a design that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been ``certified.'' A ``certified'' catalyst design would be one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which had successfully met the requirements of a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst durability demonstration procedure which is described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more detail in the following paragraphs. This approach ensures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that durable catalysts are used on small engines while avoiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive requirements that could discourage the development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very promising catalyst technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding this proposal are requested. Also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested are comments regarding the advantages and disadvantages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this requirement, as well as the alternative requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of preconditioned or aged catalysts during engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission certification testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of an oven exposure procedure for evaluating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst resistance to thermal degradation is proposed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. This procedure would involve the heating of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst in air to a temperature of 1,000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for six hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to heating the catalyst to 1,000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, an optional pre- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating procedure is proposed to be allowed to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``green'' effect of the catalyst. This optional procedure would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consist of heating the catalyst to no more than 500 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than two hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The oven exposure procedure described above is proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lieu of procedures which involve exposure to synthetic or actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust gas mixtures because EPA believes that the oven aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure aggressively and directly stresses the catalyst and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the best method for assessing the most major catalyst durability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern: thermal stability. Another advantage of this method is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is much less complex than the other exposure procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in the case of the procedure which involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to synthetic exhaust gas mixtures, information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lacking regarding the most appropriate test parameters, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temperature of the mixtures and the duration of the exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, with respect to the procedure which involves exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to actual exhaust gas mixtures, information is needed regarding a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of test variables that are related to the engine that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to generate the exhaust gas mixture, such as its combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle and power output, the manner in which it is operated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operating times that are involved in each phase of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating cycle.

General comments regarding the applicability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitability of the proposed oven exposure procedure are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested. Specific comments are also requested regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variation in the procedure, such as: The use of an oven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere other than air; if flow through the catalyst is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended; and the composition and flow rate of the gas or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gaseous mixture that is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of which method is used to age the catalyst, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means must be used to determine the effects of the aging process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the intended purpose of this process, the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straightforward evaluation would involve the determination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent to which the performance characteristics of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst had been adversely affected. Of particular significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be the adverse effect on the catalyst's conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities with respect to the oxidation of HC and CO and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reduction of NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of a procedure which uses a synthetic exhaust gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture for evaluating the effects of thermal stressing is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for several reasons. One of the main reasons is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative simplicity of such a procedure. For example, it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not involve the questions regarding the in-use representativeness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of test parameters, such as the temperature of the mixture and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the duration of the test, that arise when a synthetic exhaust gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture is used for actually thermally stressing a catalyst. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation purposes, any fixed temperature which allowed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion reactions of interest to occur could be specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specification of a particular exposure time would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required since the conversion efficiency existing as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the previous thermal stressing would be involved rather than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-related change in efficiency. Furthermore, a procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which used synthetic exhaust gas would be simpler than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure that used actual exhaust gas. Using synthetic exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas mixtures alleviates the need for detailed information not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily available at this time. Another reason for proposing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of synthetic exhaust gas mixtures is the standardization that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results; all catalysts would be aged under the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that are proposed in subpart E of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The composition of the synthetic exhaust gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture that is specified in this subpart is comparable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compositions of synthetic exhaust gas mixtures currently used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst manufacturers for testing related to the kinds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines covered by the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are solicited concerning these specifications, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly with regard to the chemical composition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the synthetic exhaust mixture and its flow rate as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it enters the test catalyst. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is proposed in this notice on the basis of on-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience and the absence of information at this time regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conversion efficiencies that will be used with small engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To illustrate this loss limit, a catalyst with initial HC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion efficiency of 50 percent would be required to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least a conversion efficiency of 40 percent after thermal

V. Test Procedure Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a technical review of an early draft of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure from the Small Engine Committee of the Society of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automotive Engineers (SAE) in September 1993. EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on several points mentioned in SAE's comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that during each mode of the emission test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle, engine manufacturers collect and analyze exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents and measure engine parameters during a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time referred to as the ``sampling period.'' EPA is proposing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sampling period be a minimum of four minutes long. The SAE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended test procedure J1088 recommends the sampling period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ``*&blank;*&blank;* at least two minutes. Longer averaging times may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to ascertain the true time averaged emissions if data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability over time is significant.'' Based on EPA's experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with several small (two to four kW) engines, a two-minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaging time for idle modes is not sufficient to make accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel flow measurements. EPA requests comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of a four minute averaging time, including any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available test data to substantiate an averaging time less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that for the final calculation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake-specific emission rate (gr/kWh), any power measured during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the idle mode not be included in the calculation for the reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake-specific emission rate. EPA believes the idle mode is, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition, that engine operating mode during which no useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work is performed. Any power measured during this mode is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the frictional losses resulting from the dynamometer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is concerned that an engine manufacturer using an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriately large dynamometer with a large frictional loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not provide an accurate measurement of the engine idle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mode. EPA believes it is inappropriate to include power generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the engine to overcome the windage losses of the dynamometer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the calculation of emissions during the idle mode. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the appropriateness of including power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured by the dynamometer in the calculation of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake-specific emission rate.

W. Duration of Certificates of Conformity, Definition of Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Year, Annual Production Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is considering adopting one of the following three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options for defining model year, annual production period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of the certificate of conformity. Regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option selected, EPA is also proposing in this notice that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be a prohibited act to introduce an uncertified small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine into commerce after August 1, 1996. Furthermore, it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a prohibited act to introduce a specific model year engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into commerce prior to or after the model year for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate of conformity was issued and in effect. EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on each of these three alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA would incorporate the on-highway definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of model year, annual production period, and duration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate of conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The model year would include January 1 of the calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which it is designated and would not include a January 1 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other calendar year. Thus, the maximum duration of a model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year would be one calendar year plus 364 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``annual production period'' for any specific model within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an engine family would begin either: (1) When such an engine was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first produced, or (2) on January 2 of the calendar year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding the year for which the model year was designated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever date was later. The annual production period would end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either: (1) When the last engine was produced, or (2) on December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31 of the calendar year for which the model year was named, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever date was sooner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A certificate of conformity would be issued to cover engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced into commerce for a single model year. Under option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, the 1997 model year certificate could cover production between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 2, 1996 and December 31, 1997, although engines regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this proposal would be manufactured after August 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may wish to consult OMS Advisory Circular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A/C No. 6B, issued December 31, 1987, which summarizes the on-highway treatment of model year, annual production
period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of the certificate of conformity. A copy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circular has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This option represents a variation of Option 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the dates selected for the commencement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year and the annual production period more closely parallel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the experience of the small engine industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under option 2, the model year would include August 1 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding calendar year for which it was designated and would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an August 1 of any other calendar year. The maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of a model year would remain one calendar year plus 364 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``annual production period'' for a specific model within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an engine family would begin either: (1) When such an engine was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first produced, or (2) on August 2 of two calendar years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding the year for which the model year was designated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever date was later. The annual production period would end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either: (1) When the last engine was produced, or (2) on July 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the calendar year for which the model year was named, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever date was sooner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certificate of conformity would be issued to cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production for a single model year. For example, the 1997 model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year could cover production between August 2, 1995 through July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed extended coverage period described in options 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 2 for a certificate of conformity (that is, up to one year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plus 364 days) is primarily intended to allow flexibility in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of new models. Under no circumstances should it be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted that existing models could ``skip'' yearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification by pulling ahead the production of every other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year. While this situation, to our knowledge, has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred in the on-highway program in the past, a practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing small SI engines for a two year period would violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' intent of annual certification based upon an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
annual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production period. EPA is not currently proposing rules for how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine when abuse has occurred since this has not been a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem to date. However, manufacturers should note EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern in this area and should use normal yearly production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods for existing models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the certificate of conformity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be issued to cover production from August 1 of a given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year through July 31 of the subsequent calendar year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it was issued. EPA would retain the model year concept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in on-highway programs but would define it as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Model year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the manufacturer's annual production period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which includes August 1 of a given calendar year through July 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the subsequent calendar year.'' Thus the maximum duration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year would be 365 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for criteria pollutants which adversely affect human health, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetation, materials, and visibility. Concentrations of ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are impacted by HC emissions and, to a lesser extent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions of CO. Ambient concentrations of CO are, of course, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacted by CO emissions. EPA has determined that the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set in this rule would reduce emissions of HC and CO and, despite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also increasing emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, help most areas come into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the NAAQS for ozone and, to a lesser extent, CO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following provides a summary of the emission reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected and the health effects of HC components, CO, and ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 in ozone formation is

also presented. The underlying analysis is described in greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detail in the draft RSD, a copy of which is in the public docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this rulemaking.

A. Estimated Emissions Impact of Proposed Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission standards proposed in today's action should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce average per-engine HC and CO emission from small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines by 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, by the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2020, when complete fleet turnover is projected. This would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in annual nationwide reductions of roughly 350,000 tons of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HC and 2,000,000 tons of CO by the year 2020. In-use NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission rates are expected to increase, roughly, from 7,000 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34,000 tons per year. This increase represents one quarter of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one percent of the national NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inventory, and is small compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the substantial NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions achieved in the nonroad large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CI proposal (58 FR 28809). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to control of HC, the proposed standards should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be effective in reducing emissions of air toxics, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. However, the magnitude of reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would depend on whether the control technology reduces the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual toxics in the same proportion to total hydrocarbons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These emission reduction estimates for HC and CO are based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on population projections using estimates of annual engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption (that is, sales), engine attrition (that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrappage), activity indicator, and current and proposed in-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission factors. Data on activity indicators and the baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission factors were obtained from the Nonroad Study. Estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of annual engine consumption for years from 1973 to 1992 were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on engine consumption data available from the PSR databases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and industry data from OPEI,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 PPEMA,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and Booz Allen &amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hamilton.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Future consumption estimates are for the most part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on estimates of population growth for the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attrition rates (that is, likelihood, as a function of engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age, that an engine remains in service) for all engines included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this analysis were developed on the assumption that equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attrition is described by a two-parameter form of the Weibull 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative distribution function.

For the analysis summarized in Tables 2 and 3, the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inventories were developed for the five regulated engine classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as for all pieces of equipment using engines covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed rule. Using estimated engine consumption and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attrition, EPA projected the total in-service engine population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each year from 1973 through 2020. EPA projected the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual nationwide HC, CO, and NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 emissions from small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the current proposal under the baseline (that is, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls applied) and controlled scenarios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the controlled scenario, EPA assumed that new engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold beginning in 1996 would meet the proposed standards. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both scenarios, in-use emission rates were determined so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for deterioration by adjusting the difference between new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine and in-use engine emission rates by a factor which is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of age of the specific engine and its B&hyph;50 or median 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life expressed in years.

B. Health and Welfare Effects of HC Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The focus of today's action is reduction of HC emission as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the solution to the ozone nonattainment problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, direct health effects are also a reason for concern due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to direct human exposure to emissions from small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during operation of equipment using such engines. Of specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern is the emission of air toxics. In some applications, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator must be adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the engine. Today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations should be effective in reducing air toxics such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data from the Nonroad Study, the exhaust and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crankcase emissions from a 2.9 kW lawnmower with a 4-stroke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine contain 3.5 grams of benzene per hour. Exhaust emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a 2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower contains 17 grams of benzene per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour. A small, 2.2 kW chainsaw emits 28.2 grams of benzene per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour, compared to a large, 4.5 kW chainsaw that emits 40.8 grams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, according to data from the Nonroad Study, 1,3- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butadiene content in exhaust and crankcase emissions from a 2.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kW, 4-stroke lawnmower is approximately 1.5 grams per hour. For a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower, 1,3-butadiene content in exhaust is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.0 grams per hour. Butadiene emitted from a small, 2.2 kW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chainsaw is approximately 12.2 grams per hour, and is 17.7 grams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per hour from a large 4.5 kW chainsaw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzene is a clear, colorless aromatic hydrocarbon which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both volatile and flammable. Benzene is present in both exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and evaporative emissions. Health effects caused by benzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions differ based on concentration and duration of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,3-butadiene is a colorless, flammable gas at room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature. This suspected human carcinogen is insoluble in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water and its two conjugated double bonds make it highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactive. 1,3&hyph;Butadiene is formed in internal combustion engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust by the incomplete combustion of the fuel and is assumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not present in evaporative and refueling emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since air toxic levels generally decrease in proportion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall emissions once emission control technology is applied, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of benzene and 1,3-butadiene produced by new small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines should diminish after this rule becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, exposure to air toxics from new small SI engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be reduced, as will associated health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is little data on direct health effects of small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine emissions. No study has been conducted involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects of air toxic emissions specifically from small SI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. The Agency requests additional information on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Health and Welfare Effects of CO Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be emitted into ambient air as a result of both natural processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and human activity. Although CO exists as a trace element in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
troposphere, much of human exposure resulting in elevated levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in the blood is due to incomplete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fossil fuel combustion, as occurs in small SI engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concentration and direct health effect of CO exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are especially important in small SI engines because the operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a small SI engine application is typically near the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it functions. In some applications, the operator must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the direct path of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust as it leaves the engine. According to numbers published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Nonroad Study, a 4-stroke, 2.9 kW lawnmower engine emits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1051.1 g/hr CO, while a 2-stroke, 2.9 kW engine emits 1188.4 g/hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no studies measuring the human health effects of CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emanating from small SI engine exhaust have been conducted, ample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research results are available concerning general health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of exposure to CO. The toxicity of CO effects on blood and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissues, and how these effects manifest themselves as organ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function changes have been topics of substantial research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts. However, most of these involved higher, more constant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure concentration levels of CO than are likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced under normal operations of these small SI engines. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies provided information for establishing the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ambient Air Quality Standard for CO. The current primary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary NAAQS for CO are 9 parts per million for the one-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average and 35 parts per million for the eight-hour average.

effective means of reducing ozone concentration. In a recent

report, researchers emphasize that both HC and NO

E. Health and Welfare Effects of Tropospheric Ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's primary reason for controlling emissions from small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SI engines is the role of HC in forming ozone. Of the major air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants for which NAAQS have been designated under the CAA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most widespread problem continues to be ozone, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most prevalent photochemical oxidant and an important component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of smog. Ozone is a product of the atmospheric chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions involving oxides of nitrogen and other compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reactions occur as atmospheric oxygen and sunlight interact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen from both mobile and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical part of this problem is the formation of ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both in and downwind of large urban areas. Under certain weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, the combination of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and HC can result in urban and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rural areas exceeding the national ambient ozone standard by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of three. The ozone NAAQS represents the maximum level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered protective of public health by the EPA.

Ozone is a powerful oxidant causing lung damage and reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory function after relatively short periods of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(approximately one hour). The oxidizing effect of ozone can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irritate the nose, mouth, and throat causing coughing, choking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and eye irritation. In addition, ozone can also impair lung 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function and subsequently reduce the respiratory system's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance to disease, including bronchial infections such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pneumonia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elevated ozone levels can also cause aggravation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Ozone can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause a reduction in performance during exercise even in healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons. In addition, ozone can also cause alterations in

pulmonary and extrapulmonary (nervous system, blood, liver,

The current NAAQS for ozone of 0.12 part per million (ppm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is set at a level that, with an adequate margin of safety, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective of public health. However, ozone has also been shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to damage forests and crops, watershed areas, and marine life.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAAQS for ozone is frequently violated across large areas in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States, and after 20 years of efforts aimed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing ozone-forming pollutants, although EPA has reported a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trend toward lower average ozone concentrations from 1982 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 the ozone standard has proven to be exceptionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to achieve. High levels of ozone have been recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even in relatively remote areas, since ozone and its precursors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can travel hundreds of miles and persist for several days in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower atmosphere. Ozone damage to plants, including both natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forest ecosystems and crops, occurs at ozone levels between 0.06 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 0.12 ppm.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Repeated exposure to ozone levels above 0.04 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm can cause reductions in the yields of some crops above ten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 While strains of some crops are relatively resistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ozone, many crops experience a loss in yield of 30 percent at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone concentrations below the NAAQS.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 The value of crops lost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ozone damage, while difficult to estimate precisely, is on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order of $2 billion per year in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ozone on complex ecosystems such as forests is even more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to quantify. However, there is evidence that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forest types are negatively affected by ambient levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, in the San Bernadino Mountains of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southern California, ozone is believed to be the agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for the slow decline and death of ponderosa pine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees in these forests since 1962.

VII. Technology Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the draft RSD, EPA presents a comprehensive technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment supporting the emission standards proposed for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class of engines in this notice. This assessment demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that small SI engine manufacturers will be technically capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving the proposed emission standards and will not be capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of achieving lower emission standards in this Phase 1 rule. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment also considers factors of noise, energy, and safety as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlined in section 213(a)(3) of the CAA. The public docket for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking contains a lengthier version of this Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The levels of the proposed emission standards under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are in large part driven by the aggressive timeline of Phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA agreed to promulgate Phase 1 small SI engine standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realize early emission reduction benefits while a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive long-term program will be developed for Phase 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Achievability of Proposed Emission Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the proposed Phase l emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are the lowest standards for Class I&hyph;V engines achievable by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996 model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The engines covered by this proposed regulation are divided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into five classes with unique emission standards proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each class. The lowest level of emission standards achievable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was determined for each class of engines. The unique standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each class are driven by differences in emission reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of engines with different combustion cycles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different displacements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class I and II engines represent nonhandheld engines that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in large part, use 4-stroke combustion cycle engines, as opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Class III&hyph;V engines which represent handheld engines that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large part, use 2-stroke combustion cycle engines. Within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time constraints for compliance with this rule, Class I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines will be capable of achieving a lower HC + NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 composite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standard and lower CO emission standard than the Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III&hyph;V engines are capable of achieving. Furthermore, within each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion cycle type, the larger displacement classes will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of achieving lower HC + NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, HC, and CO emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. A full discussion of the technical rationale for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these limitations is set forth in the draft RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's belief that the proposed emission standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Classes I&hyph;V are the lowest achievable standards is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission data provided on nonoptimized prototype configurations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of engines that meet the proposed standards, technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions with manufacturers, and EPA analysis of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on technologies collected from a range of sources. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a summary of these analyses. A complete analysis is provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the draft RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has compiled emission data on selected Class I&hyph;V engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and prototypes that were tested at either an independent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry laboratory and met the proposed emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These prototypes represent the greatest degree of emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control technology achievable given the aggressive timeline for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earliest possible introduction of these engines into commerce at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable cost (one of the parameters for achievability listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CAA section 213(a)(3)). Data was compiled and reported on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three Class I engines, two Class II engines, one Class III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine, two Class IV engines plus one data point representing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate of 27 Class IV engines, and one Class V engine plus one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data point representing the aggregate of 18 Class V engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These data and the specific technologies used on each are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional support for the proposed emission standards being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lowest achievable standards is provided by EPA's analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of confidential discussions with manufacturers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on technologies collected from a range of sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA used this summary information to compile and predict the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected percentage usage of each emission control technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Class I and II engines, EPA predicts that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will use different combinations of the following technologies: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carburetor enleanment and/or modifications; fuel system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications; ignition timing modifications; valve system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valve timing modifications; combustion chamber modifications; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling system modifications; some conversion from side valve to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhead valve engines; and some conversion from 2-stroke to 4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stroke engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Class III, IV, and V engines, EPA predicts that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers will use combinations of the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies: Carburetor enleanment and/or modifications; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carburetor limiter cap installation; fuel system modifications; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion chamber modifications; port timing and scavenging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications; cooling system modifications; and some conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 2-stroke to 4-stroke engines. The estimated percent usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each technology by engine class is presented and discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the draft RSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the technologies listed, the use of catalytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converters, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and air injection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology may occur on a limited basis or not at all in the 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year. EPA estimates that manufacturers will meet proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 1 emission standards without the use of catalysts. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some manufacturers are developing low efficiency catalysts in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case some marginally acceptable engine family should need this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology to meet the standards. If catalysts were to be used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates that their use would occur on no more than 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of Class I engines and one percent of all Class II&hyph;V 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines. EPA requests information on the likelihood that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst, EGR, or air injection systems will be used and, if so, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any additional information on percent usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Proposed Emission Standards Are Lowest Feasible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that three specific emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies, while allowing engines to meet lower standards than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those proposed today, cannot be developed within the timeline of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule or at reasonable cost. Technologies such as high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency catalytic converters, low cost fuel injection systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and low cost electronic control systems are currently either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available on only a limited basis or are in the early design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase. These technologies cannot be used on the vast majority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines by the proposed implementation date. These technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the potential to develop much greater emission reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those technologies determined to be achievable for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. As discussed in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical barriers and safety issues must still be overcome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before standards can be set that would reflect general or blanket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of these technologies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Impact on Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that the proposed emission standards can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met with the identified engine emission control technologies with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal impact on equipment design. However, EPA also believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that to propose more stringent emission standards in today's rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those already proposed would necessitate equipment redesign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to accommodate more sophisticated technologies, such as high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency catalysts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been EPA's past experience that, given the latitude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to change either the engine or equipment, most manufacturers will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose to modify the engine. EPA estimates that most engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
models will require only internal modifications (such as tighter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tolerances and fuel mixture enleanment strategies) to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards. These modifications will have little, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any, effect on equipment design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates that few engine models will be discontinued as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result of the proposed standards. Models that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discontinued represent older engine designs and low volume sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this market generally has a large number of engine models, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutions should be readily available for these few incidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of model discontinuation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Catalytic converter use is not predicted for the Phase 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. However, if catalysts should be used on a small percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of equipment, EPA has estimated the equipment impact of catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in terms of additional shielding as a result of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust skin temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft RSD summarizes EPA's estimates of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts as a result of this rulemaking. EPA requests comment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information with respect to the estimations concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the proposed standards on equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Energy, Noise, and Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213(a)(3) of the Act requires that EPA also give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate consideration to energy, noise, and safety factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the application of technologies. Energy factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include engine fuel consumption and power. Noise factors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self explanatory, and safety factors include safety for the user 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as compliance with other existing regulations in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country and abroad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, EPA has analyzed the likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average fuel consumption change considering all factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would impact the final figure in actual use. EPA estimates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reduction in fuel consumption is likely to be seen in actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use and will average approximately 13 percent for handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines and 26 percent for nonhandheld engines. Since this is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable impact, little additional design effort will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expended to optimize fuel consumption effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers will also optimize final designs such that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected power loss on resulting production engines will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimized. Based on analyses in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates that the resulting average power change in actual use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be a gain of approximately five percent for Class I and II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines and a three percent reduction for Class III&hyph;V engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major contributors to this gain for Class I and II are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in technology for Class I side valve engines which make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up a large majority of engines in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although overall power may increase, some engines may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience a decrease in power availability. However, real time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data collected on equipment in actual use demonstrate that many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines do not need their full power capability in actual use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is especially true in the case of nonhandheld engines. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of these engines will likely experience no performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact as a result of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engine noise level is expected to stay at current levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further discussion of this issue can be found in ``V.O. Cap on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noise.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many safety regulations and recommendations have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for small engines and their related use in equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations will affect the feasibility of using some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies on handheld engines. One example is a regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring spark arresters on equipment used on certain federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands. See 36 CFR part 261. The regulation results in a temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit on exhaust and exhaust surfaces which, to date, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in a limitation on the feasibility of the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalysts for handheld engines due to the high heat levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emitted during conversion of pollutants as seen when applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety recommendations and regulations also have an impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the end use of the engines. Some small SI equipment have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating restrictions of certain speeds and loads. One example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is ANSI standard B71.1 which contains information for measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mower blade tip speed and a description of the use of safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake systems. A summary of safety regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations is presented in the draft RSD. EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further information on additional safety regulations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements which may impact engines covered by this rulemaking.

E. Per Engine Cost Estimates Due to Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The technical solutions required to meet the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards proposed in this notice will be cost-effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further discussion is presented in ``IX. Cost-Effectiveness.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this summary presents only aggregate costs for nonhandheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and handheld engines, the draft RSD gives cost estimates by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology and by engine displacement class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The retail price of equipment which uses nonhandheld engines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges from $90 to $9,000. On average, the cost to the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer to install the necessary emission control technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these engines will be approximately $0.80 to $1.13 per engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The retail price of equipment which uses handheld engines ranges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from $60 to $1,000. On average, the cost to install the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary control technology on all handheld equipment engines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardware variable costs, and production costs will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $2.05 to $2.20 per engine to the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer. Tables in the draft RSD list the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated variable hardware and production cost broken out by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine technology for each engine class.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's cost estimate assumes that catalytic converters will not be needed to comply with proposed standards. However,
as discussed previously, engine manufacturers may voluntarily decide to use catalysts on a percentage of engines
at risk of only marginally complying. Should catalysts actually be used, EPA estimates that the additional variable
hardware costs for nonhandheld engines will be $1.09 per engine and for handheld engine will be $0.10 per engine, with
an additional $0.24 per engine for equipment modifications and $0.20 per potential heat shielding. The Agency requests
additional comment on these cost estimates for application of catalyst technology and equipment impacts.

VIII. Economic Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total national average annual cost of this rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $55 million. If catalysts become necessary, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average annual cost estimate becomes $73 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's economic analysis of the proposed rule's likely impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on consumers and industry indicates that reducing pollution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these engines will result in offsetting costs to consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumers will find small increases in retail prices for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment powered by these engines. The initial purchase price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the consumer will, however, be partially offset by savings in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel and maintenance costs. Thus, over time, environmentally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
friendly, alternatively powered equipment such as electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered trimmers, chain saws, and lawnmowers will become less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costly to consumers. Industry will bear pollution control costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are moderate (roughly six percent for handheld and two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for nonhandheld equipment) relative to current production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. (The level of pollution control costs is largely due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the high levels of pollution emitted by these engines, especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-stroke engines, and the relatively outdated state of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology compared to on-highway engines.) However, the costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are small in absolute terms, and it is anticipated that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs will be passed through to consumers in higher product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices. The complete economic analysis can be found in Chapter 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Consumer Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimated the increase in consumer cost of the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered by these engines. In assessing consumer cost, three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas were analyzed: change to the retail cost of the engine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of fuel, and cost of maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Retail Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The increase in retail price of the equipment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer is estimated using a percentage increase over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average amortized and discounted per engine manufacturers' cost, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weighted by the sales mix. As such, the estimated sales-weighted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average increase in retail cost to the consumer due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule in 1996 is $4.04 for handheld equipment and $2.35 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for nonhandheld equipment. If catalysts are necessary, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated sales-weighted average increase in retail cost to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer due to the proposed rule in 1996 is $4.30 for handheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and $3.68 for nonhandheld equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The retail price effects for specific engines may be more or less than the costs shown here, depending on the specific
technology of the engine. However, the price increases shown here reflect the relative price increases considering
all types of engines in the market. Therefore, these estimates are not indicative of the price increase specific to
any particular manufacturer's engine or equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Fuel Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is expected to decrease fuel consumption significantly. The average sales-weighted handheld engine is
expected to experience a 13 percent decrease in fuel consumption and the average sales-weighted nonhandheld engine
is expected to experience a 26 percent decrease in fuel consumption. However, these decreases are translated into
small discounted lifetime sales-weighted fuel savings of approximately $0.22 for a handheld engine and $2.79 for
a nonhandheld engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Maintenance Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that the engines produced to meet the proposed emission standards will be higher quality: the parts
and raw materials will be more durable and less likely to malfunction. See Chapter 2 of the draft RSD for further discussion
of this phenomenon. This will result in equipment which is operational a higher percentage of the time and which lasts
longer. EPA is unable to estimate the increase in useful life or the decrease in maintenance costs at this time. EPA
requests comment on the potential decrease in maintenance costs and potential increase in useful life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Lifetime Consumer Cost Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The lifetime consumer cost impact was assessed by considering the decrease in maintenance cost and the fuel savings
along with the increase in retail price of the average, sales- weighted engine. The increase in price of an engine will
be mitigated somewhat by these other impacts. Applying the lifetime savings in fuel costs, the average sales-weighted
handheld engine's lifetime increase in cost will be adjusted to $3.82 and the average sales-weighted nonhandheld
engine's lifetime cost impact will be a savings of $0.44. If catalysts are necessary this will be $4.08 for a handheld
engine and $.89 for a nonhandheld engine. EPA requests comments on lifetime consumer costs. Submission of quantified
estimates would be beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Incremental Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA considered the potential incremental economic impacts due to today's proposal. EPA estimates the net present
value of pollution control capital costs to be approximately $27 million. EPA estimates that there will be no long
run negative impacts on employment as a result of this rule. Costs can be recovered through increased prices. Any potential
decreases in employment that might occur due to obsolescence of product line should be offset by increased production
of engines meeting emission standards. Total demand for these products has traditionally been relatively inelastic,
and thus industry sales volume is not expected to decrease. Energy impacts will be positive, freeing up approximately
$9 million for other uses in the economy.

IX. Cost-Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the costs and benefits in the previous discussion, EPA has prepared a cost-effectiveness analysis and
has performed a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this proposal. See ``X.A. Administrative Requirements'' for
an explanation of the mandate for an RIA. Because the benefits of this proposal are not easily monetized, a cost-effectiveness
analysis has been prepared. The complete RIA is contained in the draft RSD. Presented here is a summary of the cost-effectiveness
of the proposed small SI engine Phase 1 program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If all program costs are allocated to HC reductions, today's proposal has a cost-effectiveness of $197 per ton of HC
reduced. Alternatively, if all program costs are allocated to CO reductions, the cost-effectiveness would be $37
per ton. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the costs of the program were equally split between HC and CO, the cost-effectiveness of HC reduction would be $99
per ton and the cost-effectiveness of CO would be $19 per ton. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These cost-effectiveness numbers are significantly lower than costs per ton of other available control strategies.
The cost-effectiveness estimates, underlying quantitative methodology, and comparisons to other available control
strategies discussed above are explained further in the draft RSD/RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the cost-effectiveness of the standard included in the current proposal is favorable relative to the
cost- effectiveness of several other control measures required under the Clean Air Act. To the extent that cost-effective
nationwide controls are applied to small SI engines, the need may be reduced to apply in the future more expensive additional
controls to mobile and stationary sources that also contribute to ozone nonattainment, nutrient loading, and visibility.

A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Under Executive Order 12866, (58 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 51,735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore
subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact
of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in the Executive Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because this rulemaking adversely affects in a material way a sector of the economy, namely manufacturers
of small SI engines, particularly the manufacturers who specialize in the production of small handheld engines.
Further, EPA believes that an RIA is important for this rule because small SI engines have not previously been regulated.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Copies of the ICR document may be obtained
from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW (PM&hyph;223Y), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling
(202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 4 provides a listing of this proposed rulemaking's information collection requirements along with the appropriate
information collection request (ICR) numbers. The cost of this burden has been incorporated into the cost estimate
for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has estimated that the public reporting burden for the collection of information required under this proposed
rule would average approximately 6,100 hours annually for a typical engine manufacturer. The hours spent by a manufacturer
on information collection activities in any given year would be highly dependent upon manufacturer specific variables,
such as the number of engine families, production changes, emission defects, etc.

C. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of
these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). The RFA explores options
for minimizing those impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has recently adopted a new approach to regulatory flexibility
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 for purposes of EPA's implementation of the Act, any impact is a significant impact, and any number of small entities
is a substantial number. Thus, EPA will consider regulatory options for every regulation subject to the Act that can
reasonably be expected to have an impact on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' April 9, 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Therefore, in light of this new approach, EPA has determined that this rule will have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities. As a result, EPA has tailored this rule to minimize the cost burdens imposed on smaller engine
manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations contain certification requirements for new engines, in-use testing requirements for
controlled engines, Selective Enforcement Auditing provisions for the testing of production engines, and prohibitions
on incorrect engine use for equipment manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification program has been structured in this proposal such that all manufacturers may take advantage of
a more simplified certification process than that currently mandated in the on-highway program. Testing requirements
for test engines are reduced. The application and certification process is more straightforward. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The in-use testing program is structured such that manufacturers with lower annual production volumes have a lower
minimum number of engines which must be tested. This places the burden of the in-use testing mostly on manufacturers
with high production volumes. Provisions are also allowed for manufacturers whose number of product lines are limited.
Also, manufacturers with very low production volumes are allowed maximum flexibility in procuring engines to be
tested. Refer to ``IV.C.10. In-use Testing Program'' for a more detailed discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SEA program is structured such that the annual limit on the number of SEA's that EPA may perform is lower for manufacturers
with lower projected annual production. Additionally, manufacturers with high projected annual production but
fewer engine families will have a lower annual limit. Furthermore, manufacturers with low projected annual production
may perform fewer audit tests per day to minimize the SEA burden on its test facilities. Refer to ``IV.C.19. Selective
Enforcement Auditing Program'' for a more detailed discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that equipment manufacturers must correctly use engines that are certified upon implementation
of these regulations. However, EPA has decided to make the use of non- certified engines for United States-marketed
equipment a prohibited act rather than requiring equipment manufacturers to report to EPA that they are using certified
engines in their equipment being consumed in the United States. Further, it is a prohibited act for equipment manufacturers
to incorrectly use an engine certified as handheld in nonhandheld equipment marketed in the United States. EPA decided
to make these provisions prohibited acts in order to reduce any potential reporting or recordkeeping burden for engine
and equipment manufacturers. Manufacturers who attempt to sell equipment to the United States market which uses
noncertified engines or uses handheld engines in nonhandheld equipment will be voluntarily reported to EPA by their
competitors. EPA has proposed stiff fines on prohibited acts. Competition should effectively police these prohibited
acts as competitors have a competitive incentive to make sure that no equipment manufacturer is dumping equipment
with lower cost, unlawful, noncertified, or incorrectly used engines (that is, the use of a handheld engine in nonhandheld
equipment) into the U.S. market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered, but rejected, the notion of exempting small manufacturers from enforcement programs or from the
regulation entirely. A more proportionate sharing of cost burden was deemed appropriate. The pollution emitted
by each of these engines not only contributes to ambient air quality problems but also has health impacts on the user
of the equipment who is in close proximity to the exhaust emissions. See ``VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment''
for a discussion of the health impacts of the related exhaust pollutants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On its own initiative and pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C.
346a(e), EPA is proposing a time-limited tolerance for the residues of imidacloprid on dried hops at 3.0 parts per
million (ppm). EPA recently reclassified dried hops as raw agricultural commodity (59 FR 9167; Feb. 25, 1994 and 59
FR 17487; April 13, 1994). EPA is proposing the tolerance because EPA has granted a petition for an emergency exemption
under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136p, for the use of imidacloprid
on hops in the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; imidacloprid is used in other countries that export hops to
the United States; and the database for imidacloprid is relatively complete. The most significant data gap for establishing
a permanent tolerance for imidacloprid on dried hops is a third field-residue trial. Given the relatively low risks
presented by imidacloprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will significantly change EPA's risk assessment.
Nevertheless, EPA is establishing a 1-year time limitation on this tolerance for a full residue data base to be available
in making a decision on a permanent tolerance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All relevant materials have been evaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 100 ppm (8 mg/kg/bwt); rat
and rabbit teratology studies were negative at doses up to 30 mg/kg/bwt and 24 mg/kg/bwt, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of
the study and had a NOEL of 100 ppm (5.7 mg/kg/bwt in male and 7.6 mg/kg/bwt female) for noncarcinogenic effects that
included decreased body weight gain in females at 300 ppm and increased thyroid lesions in males at 300 ppm and females
at 900 ppm..
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1,250 ppm (41/mg/kg/bwt).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study
and that had a NOEL of 1,000 ppm (208 mg/kg/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no cancer risk associated with exposure to this chemical. Imidacloprid has been classified as a ``Group E''
(no evidence of carcinogenicity for humans) carcinogen by the OPP Reference Dose (RfD) Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD), based on the 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenic study with a NOEL of 5.7 mg/kg/bwt and 100-fold
uncertainity factor, is calculated to be 0.057 mg/kg/bwt. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC)
from the proposed tolerances is 0.000984 mg/kg/bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent percent of the ADI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue in plants and livestock is adequately understood. Results of a bovine feeding study show
that finite imidacloprid residues will actually occur in milk, meat, fat, and meat by-products of cattle, goats,
hogs, horses, and sheep from feeding of imidacloprid-treated raw agricultural commodities or their processed commodities
when the formulations are used as directed; therefore, tolerances are required. Spent hops are not considered a poultry
feed item; therefore, secondary imidacloprid tolerances for poultry and eggs are not required. The analytical method
is a common moiety method for imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridiyl moiety in plants
using a permanganate oxidation, silyl derivatization, and capillary GC-MS selective ion monitoring. The magnitude
of the residue crop field trial data for imidacloprid on hops indicate that residues of total imidacloprid will not
exceed the proposed tolerance when the formulations are used as directed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tolerance would be established for 1 year, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective
date of a final rule based on this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the above information
considered by the Agency, the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health.
Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement of this effect
was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rule making (Notice) solicits comment on whether, within particular services classified
as Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS), there may be types of providers that merit forbearance from certain requirements
found in Title II of the Communications Act. Specifically, the Commission asks whether we should forbear from enforcing
those provisions of Title II that we determined did not merit general forbearance in our Second Report and Order in
Gen. Docket No. 93&hyph;252. If the further forbearance is warranted, the Commission asks how we should determine
which types of CMRS providers should be excused from remaining Title II requirements and how we should implement and
enforce such forbearance provisions.

Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In the Second Report and Order in General Docket No. 93&hyph;252, 59 FR 18493 (Apr. 19, 1994) the Commission elected,
pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act), to forbear from applying Sections 203, 204,
205, 211, 212, and 214 of Title II of the Communications Act to any service classified as CMRS. The Commission determined
that the remaining sections of Title II should be enforced with respect to CMRS providers in order to promote competition
or to protect consumers, and that this decision would not place any undue burden on any CMRS provider or class of providers.
Nevertheless, the Commission also announced that it would consider additional relief in a future rule making that
would gather a more extensive record on the potential effect of the remaining sections of Title II on particular types
of CMRS providers within each class of service. The purpose of this Notice is to initiate that rule making.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Budget Act authorizes the Commission to take forbearance actions if it determines that: (i) Enforcement of
such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practice, classifications, or regulations for
or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly discriminatory; (ii) enforcement
of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and (iii) specifying such provision is consistent
with the public interest. The legislative history of this provision indicates that the Commission may distinguish
among types of CMRS providers in making this determination. Assuming that further forbearance in a particular case
would not adversely affect rates or practices or harm consumers under the first two prongs of the test, the Commission
tentatively identified two factors under the public interest test of the last prong that could serve to guide its determinations:
(1) Whether there are differential costs of compliance with the remaining Title II sections that could make further
forbearance appropriate for particular types of providers; and (2) whether the public interest benefits from application
of particular Title II provisions are less for certain types of CMRS providers. Thus, in applying the last prong of
the statutory test, the Commission asks commenters to identify (1) the benefits of applying the remaining Title II
sections, (2) the costs of compliance with any the remaining Title II sections, and (3) whether the costs of compliance
with any of the remaining sections of Title II outweigh the benefits. In addition, the Commission asks, pursuant to
47 CFR 332(c)(1)(C), whether further forbearance will enhance future CMRS competition from a diversity of entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission also asks commenters to demonstrate actual or projected costs of compliance with each provision
of Title II that was not forborne, and the extent to which such costs vary across different types of providers. For example,
if the costs of regulation are fixed, it could indicate that small CMRS providers are more likely than other types of
CMRS providers to be burdened by the costs of regulation. The Commission asks whether there are instances where these
additional costs outweigh the public interest benefits of applying the statutory provision in issue. The Commission
seeks evidence on the magnitude of any such fixed costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Commenters should address (1) how the statutory forbearance test applies to each remaining Title II provision,
(2) how further forbearance from applying each provision of Title II would enhance future CMRS competition, (3) how
Congressional intent underlying each Title II provision would be affected, (4) how forbearance for particular types
of CMRS providers would comport with regulatory symmetry and (5) whether there are other factors or alternatives
we should consider in classifying CMRS for further forbearance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission seeks comment on its tentative view that there would be no purpose in forbearing from applying 47
U.S.C. 210, which allows common carriers to issue franks and passes to their employees, and to provide the Government
with free service in connection with preparation for national defense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Commission characterized 47 U.S.C. 213, 215, 218, 219, and 220 as primarily reservations of authority and reaffirmed
its finding in the Second Report and Order that it was unnecessary to forbear from applying these provisions to CMRS.
Section 213 authorizes the Commission to make valuations of carrier property. Section 215 gives the Commission the
authority to examine carrier activities and transactions. Section 218 authorizes the Commission to inquire into
the management of a carrier and its owner. Section 219, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
authorizes the Commission to require annual reports from carriers. Section 220 gives the Commission discretion
to prescribe the forms of accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by carriers, as well as depreciation rates. Even
though these provisions impose no affirmative obligations on CMRS providers, and may have no immediate impact on
CMRS, the Commission seeks comment on whether the potential for increased regulation (and any concomitant costs)
might have an adverse economic impact on specific types of provides that is not in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 47 CFR 223 governs obscene, harassing and indecent communications. In relevant part, the statute forbids a common
carrier (if the carrier collects payments for an adult information provider using the carrier's services) to the
extent technically feasible, to permit access to an obscene or indecent communication from the telephone of any subscriber
who has not previously requested such access. This requirement, known as ``reverse blocking,'' applies only if a
carrier bills and collects fees for the adult information provider. As a technical matter, then, a CMRS provider subject
to this obligation would have to program its switch (should it employ one) to accomplish this blocking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Commission tentatively reaffirms its general conclusion in the Second Report and Order that section 223 should
continue to apply to CMRS. Commenters are asked to address the impact of section 223 on existing and projected CMRS
offerings, and in particular, whether CMRS providers are likely to be involved in services that implicate Section
223.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. 47 U.S.C. 225, Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act, requires all common carriers providing interstate
or intrastate telephone voice transmission service to provide telecommunications services that enable persons
with hearing and speech disabilities to communicate with hearing individuals. Common carriers may select one of
several methods of offering TRS, but most have elected to designate a TRS provider or to provide TRS in concert with
other carriers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. For purposes of further forbearance, the Commission asks whether there are any CMRS providers whose market is
so specialized, or their customer base or size of operation so small that applying TRS obligations to them would not
appreciably advance the universal service objectives of Section 225. Would forbearance in such cases meet the test
in section 332? Parties are also asked to address whether the need for forbearance is reduced by providers' ability
to designate a third party to provide TRS. The Commission also seeks comment on whether there are technical or operational
limitations that would make compliance with our TRS technical standards difficult for a particular type of CMRS provider.
The Commission asks whether interfacing with a third-party TRS provider would also pose technical difficulties,
particularly for those private providers who will be reclassified as CMRS after new technical/operational rules
become effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Commission has adopted a shared-funding mechanism for interstate TRS cost recovery. Under the Commission's
shared-funding plan, providers of interstate telecommunications services are required to contribute to a TRS fund
and comply with reporting and filing obligations, including conforming their accounts to a specified format. The
amount of the yearly contribution is a percentage (.00030) of the carrier's gross interstate revenues. Each carrier
must contribute at least $100, even if its share under the actual computation would be less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. In light of the small percentage used to calculate the contribution and the low minimum required, the Commission
asks whether the burden from the funding and concomitant filing obligations are likely to be significant for any type
of CMRS. The Commission also reiterates that providers that do not themselves use TRS facilities are nevertheless
required to contribute to the Fund. The Commission seeks comment on its tentative view that the public interest would
not be furthered by exempting CMRS entirely because they do not use TRS facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Telephone Operator Consumer Services Improvement Act (TOCSIA), codified at 47 U.S.C. 226, protects consumers
making interstate operator service calls from phones available to the public or to transient users against unreasonably
high rates and anti-competitive practices. It regulates two groups. The first consists of operator service providers
(OSPs). These are providers of interstate telecommunications service from phones available to the public or to transient
users that give automatic or live assistance for billing or completion to a caller. The second group are aggregators,
generally persons that, in the ordinary course of their operations, make telephones available to the public or to
transient users of the premises and who use a provider of operator services. Pursuant to TOCSIA and Commission rules,
OSPs are subject to various identification, disclosure and billing requirements, including the requirement that
they ``brand'' calls, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
audibly identify themselves at the beginning of the call and before the consumer incurs any charges for the call. They
may not engage in ``call splashing'' (transfer of a call to another carrier at a location different from the originating
consumer where the second carrier cannot tell the originating location, with the result that the charge to the consumer
is incorrect and not based on originating location). OSPs must file informational tariffs. Aggregators are required
to identify and disclose certain information regarding the presubscribed OSP and to disclose that rate information
is available and that the consumer has the right to use an OSP of his or her choice. The aggregator must also ensure (1)
that its telephones presubscribed to an OSP allow consumers to use 800 or 900 numbers to obtain access to the OSP of choice,
and (2) according to an established implementation schedule, that any of its presubscribed equipment allows the
consumer to use equal access (10XXX) codes to access the customer's choice of OSP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The Notice requests comment on whether forbearance from section 226 for particular classes of CMRS would be justified.
Parties advocating forbearance for specific types of providers from the aggregator or OSP rules should explain how
such action would meet the three-part test for forbearance under Section 332. In particular, parties should address
how the first and second prongs of the test, that rates be just and reasonable and that consumers be adequately protected,
would be met. In connection with the third prong, parties should address whether the statute imposes any costs that
would be exceptionally difficult for certain types of CMRS provider to bear, and whether forbearance in such case
would significantly diminish statutory protections for the public. In particular, the Commission seeks comment
on whether such costs are likely to prove unduly burdensome for specific types of small CMRS providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. 227, restricts the use of automatic telephone
dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, and telephone facsimile machines to send unsolicited
advertisements. TCPA prohibits autodialed and prerecorded voice message calls to emergency lines, health care
facilities or similar establishments, and with certain exceptions, number (such as cellular numbers) for which
the called party is charged for the call.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. Current TCPA obligations primarily apply to the originator of the unwanted message, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 telemarketers. Unless a CMRS provider also engages in telemarketing or sends unsolicited facsimiles or other unwanted
communications, the statute generally does not apply to it. In so far as small CMRS providers act as originators of
unsolicited voice or facsimile transmissions, the Commission tentatively concludes that forbearance for such
providers would not adequately protect consumers' privacy interests under the second prong of the Section 332 test.
Moreover, the decision to undertake telemarketing services would be a voluntary business judgment on the part of
a CMRS provider. Such telemarketing is not a necessary part of what is generally regarded as CMRS. The Commission also
sees no public interest benefit under the third prong of the test in permitting CMRS providers, even small ones, to
undertake such activities without complying with TCPA. The Notice seeks comment on these tentative views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. 47 U.S.C. 228 incorporates the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA), which governs pay-per-call
services (also known as ``audiotext'' or ``900'' services), and imposes obligations in interexchange carriers,
local exchange carriers and common carriers in general. Pursuant to the Act and our implementing regulations, local
exchange carriers must offer subscribers, where technically feasible, an option to block access to 900 services.
They must also tariff the terms and conditions for such blocking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. TDDRA also imposes additional obligations on all common carriers. (a) 800 Service. With certain exceptions,
information service charges cannot be assessed against callers to 800 and other toll-free numbers. Common carriers
must enforce this obligation by contract or tariff. (b) Collect Calls. Common carriers may not transmit collect information
services that are either at a per-call or per-time-interval charge that is greater than, or in addition to, the charge
for the transmission of the call, or have not been affirmatively accepted by the called party. (c) Payment. Common
carriers are prohibited from disconnecting or interrupting service for failure to remit pay-per-call or similar
service charges. Common carriers may not recover the cost of complying with TDDRA requirements from ratepayers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The Commission seeks comment on the extent to which the local exchange carrier obligation to permit subscribers
to block access where technically feasible should apply to CMRS, and whether there are particular types of CMRS providers
for which such an obligation would be particularly difficult. Would local exchange carriers provide blocking for
customers of CMRS providers that interconnect with the public switched network? Additional TDDRA obligations,
including restrictions on disconnection or on transmission of collect pay-per-call charges, are imposed on carriers
who bill and collect for 900 services, which is not a common carrier service. The Commission asks for comment on whether
this type of voluntary business activity is not essential to provision of CMRS and hence, would not justify forbearance
for any type of CMRS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. In analyzing application of any of the above TDDRA obligations, commenters are asked to address the three parts
of the section 332 forbearance test. In connection with the third prong, the Commission asks whether Section 228 obligations
would impose exceptional costs on certain types of CMRS and whether forbearance in such cases would significantly
diminish statutory protections to the public. Parties should also address the effect forbearance would have on the
TDDRA objectives of promoting the legitimate development of pay-per-call services and protecting consumers from
fraudulent and deceptive practices.

II. CMRS Providers Meriting Further Forbearance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. Turning to the question of which types of CMRS providers merit further forbearance, the Commission asks as a threshold
matter whether any further forbearance is merited, noting that application of Title II is not expected to create any
undue burden on any CMRS provider, or on CMRS competition generally. To the extent that regulatory obligations impose
fixed costs, however, they would place relatively greater burdens on small providers who have less of a revenue base
and other resources to support them. The Commission seeks comment on whether there are technical or operational limitations
inherent in the services these small businesses provide that may make application of certain of the statutory provisions
in question not in the public interest. The Commission also recognizes the public interest in maintaining opportunities
for small businesses and the role that further forbearance might play in reducing the cost of doing business for them.
The Notice thus seeks comment on whether the size of the provider may be a basis for defining CMRS eligibility for further
forbearance. Finally, the Notice seeks comment on whether to consider an analysis of a CMRS provider's customer base
as another possible factor in determining the appropriateness of further forbearance. Certain types of providers,
particularly small providers, may serve predominantly business customers who require more advanced communications
services and may have relatively greater bargaining power than CMRS customers that make personal use of the service.
As a result the differing needs of business and individual customers could affect the analysis of whether forbearance
would reduce benefits to customers. In addition, the Commission asks whether it should distinguish between medium
to large business customers, and small businesses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. The Commission seeks comment on how to determine which type of provider should be considered ``small'' for purposes
of further forbearance. The Commission asks interested parties to comment on whether any one or any combination of
the options advanced below should be applied. Parties are invited to identify alternatives and to comment on how the
Commission could draw on its experience in identifying small carriers in other contexts, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the exemption to the cable-telco cross-ownership rule. Finally, the Notice asks interested parties to provide
their views on how the Commission might best implement and enforce any classification scheme. The Notice seeks comment
on the advantages and disadvantages of the various options with respect to implementation by both the Commission
and licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Measurement Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. One possible standard for size of business operation is the Small Business Administration (SBA) definition of
small entity: an entity with a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes
for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. The Commission relied on this standard to define small businesses
entitled to preferences under the spectrum auction rules. The Commission believes that these criteria are appropriate
for identifying entities entitled to preferred entry into new business ventures, as in the spectrum auction context.
The Commission tentatively finds, however, that this standard is too generous for purposes of determining which
CMRS providers are entitled to relief from remaining title II obligations, many of which, as discussed above, are
designed to protect consumers. The Notice thus asks whether the Commission should employ a more modest income and
net worth standard. Those commenters that nevertheless advocate use of this approach should discuss how it would
affect the different services comprising CMRS, providing as much data as possible on the number of providers in a particular
service that would be eligible for further forbearance under this definition, and how it would affect consumer protection.
The Commission might also measure size and scope by a number of objective factors, such as average revenues per subscriber
or percentage of interconnected traffic, average number of customers or for part 90 licensees, number of mobile units,
or average subscriber rate. Interested parties should provide data to demonstrate whether providers within their
suggested definition would find the costs of complying with the title II regulatory obligations burdensome and how
their recommended definition comports with the statutory factors set forth in section 332(c) governing forbearance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. The Commission also seeks comment on how, if standards applicable to individual providers are established, it
should treat affiliated corporations or operators of systems in more than one geographic area or providers who own
multiple small systems. In addition, the Notice seeks comment on whether the Commission should attribute ownership
of systems that are operated pursuant to an exclusive management contract, and thus not forbear when management contracts
are in force. Further, it seeks comment on the impact, if any, of industry mergers on application of a size standard.
Should a small system's affiliation with a corporation that would yield greater vertical integration disqualify
that system from further forbearance? Would a small mobile system necessarily enjoy benefits of scale and scope from
an affiliation with, for example, a long distance provider? If so, would such a provider be ineligible for further
forbearance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Number of channels would provide an administratively straightforward means of identifying small CMRS entities.
The Commission thus asks for comment on whether number of channels is a workable and rational approach to measuring
size of CMRS licensees. Commenters should specify specific types of CMRS providers licensed under parts 22 and 90
of the Commission's Rules, and suggest numbers of channels that would identify small providers in each mobile radio
service. In responding to these questions, commenters should consider the likelihood that channels can be aggregated
to form systems that would no longer be operated by a small provider, and how transition to a different level of forbearance
would be effectuated. Commenters should also address how licensees conforming to this approach would be affected
by the remaining title II obligations discussed above, and whether their users or competitors would be adversely
affected by further forbearance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The character of a provider's customer base,_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
whether its customers subscribe to the service to meet their business communications requirements, or whether customers
are primarily consumers with a personal need for mobile communications service_may be another possible factor to
consider in determining whether to undertake further forbearance. To the extent that certain types of CMRS providers
predominantly serve business customers._such as traditional SMR and business radio service,_rather than individual
customers, such business customers may have relatively greater bargaining power and information concerning their
telecommunications options. In addition, the Commission asks whether it should also distinguish between large
and medium-sized and small business customers, on the assumption that small businesses may be more like individual
consumers in their bargaining power over telecommunications services. The Commission accordingly seeks comment
on (1) whether to apply an analysis of a CMRS provider's customer base and (2) what factors might contribute to this
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Case-by-Case Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. The Commission might also extend further forbearance to particular CMRS providers on a case-by-case basis. Under
this approach, providers desiring further forbearance from the remaining provisions of title II that continue to
apply could petition the Commission to forbear in individual circumstances. To qualify for further forbearance,
petitioners would have to demonstrate that they meet the statutory test for forbearance, as implemented by the rules
and policies established in this proceeding. The Notice seeks comment on this approach, which is consistent with
the Commission's previous conclusion that the degree of forbearance adopted in the Second Report and Order should
not be unduly burdensome for the vast majority of CMRS providers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28. If the Commission exercises further forbearance with respect to individual providers, how should the Commission
enforce its standards efficiently, in terms of both identifying eligible entities and deterring evasive behavior?
One option would be to amend application forms to require certification of compliance with specific standards as
part of our revised application form for the mobile services. The Commission could use random staff audits of licensees
to determine whether they in fact quality for further forbearance. A second alternative would be to impose affirmative
reporting requirements on small providers. A third option would be to rely on complaints alleging violations of our
further forbearance standards. Commenters should discuss these and any alternative enforcement methods. The Notice
also seeks comment on whether existing licensees should have to file a separate certification to be eligible for further
forbearance.

 This Notice proposes to reduce the administrative burdens and costs of compliance with Title II regulation on small
CMRS providers. As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals suggested in this
document. Written public comments are requested on the IFRA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same
filing deadlines as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating
them as responses to the IRFA. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice, including the IRFA, to the Chief Counsel
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility
